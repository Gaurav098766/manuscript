role in advancing Point-of-Care-Testing (PoCT) technologies. 
Traditional lab-based testing, while effective, are often 
expensive, time-consuming, require large clinical samples, and 
depend on trained personnel for operation. This study presents 
an innovative, cost-efficient, and user-friendly approach using a 
graphite pencil-based bipolar electrode BPE-ECL system for 
the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) concentrations. The 
8B graphite pencil, chosen for its superior electrochemical 
properties and affordability, serves as an alternative to 
conventional screen-printed electrodes. A portable, 3D-printed 
platform integrated with a smartphone captures ECL signals, 
with a specialized software analyzing signal intensity to 
determine H₂O₂ concentrations. The system was validated for 
different H₂O₂ concentrations, demonstrating linearity between 
0.01 mM and 1 mM with limit of detection of 9µM. Repeatability 
analysis confirmed the device’s long-term reliability. This low-
cost, rapidly assembled, and compact system offers promising 
applications 
in 
biomedical 
diagnostics, 
environmental 
monitoring, and PoCT, presenting a valuable alternative to 
existing sensor technologies.",
manuscripts-papers,Graphene-AuNP electrodes for wearable gel-free EEG and health monitoring in wearable glasses Tushar ,"Abstract—Development of wearable EEG systems hinge upon
usage of dry electrodes for long-term usage without loss of
connectivity or increase in impedance leading to loss of signal
quality. Furthermore, the form factor of these electrodes should
be small and easily formable to integrate with wearable devices
for smooth and subtle monitoring of biosignals. In this paper we
present a wearable system consisting of polyimide based EEG
electrodes with auxillary monitoring sensors which will be able
to provide a holistic approach to health management. In this
paper, we demonstrate that deposition of gold nanoparticiles on
graphene substrate leads to enhanced EEG monitoring. It also
leads to reduced impedance compared to commercially available
electrodes. The EEG electrodes were integrated into glasses with
sensors for wearable EEG monitoring with position sensing, PPG
recording and camera module for monitoring attention span.

cultivation of tomato pose a significant threat to crop yield and
quality. Early prediction and detection are critical to mitigating
these risks. Yet, traditional methods often lack the precision
and adaptiveness necessary for timely interventions. In this
study, we explore how granular ambient and field-level sensing
could be used for the effective prediction of tomato pests and
diseases. We collect and analyze micro-climate conditions such
as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours,
along with field-specific variables associated with crop and pest
incidents from the stress hotspot with mobile sensing. For this
study, we have taken a tomato belt from a district in Tamil
Nadu as our region of interest where the forecasting objective is
supported by automated detection of reported conditions. This
fusion of data not only allows for refined learning of micro-
climatic factors influencing pest and disease outbreak but also
provides the ability to adapt to rapid changes in infestation
trends. With Early Blight disease in tomato, as an example,
we evaluate various frameworks to develop the proposed model

manuscripts-papers,Maximising Corn Productivity with Sustainable Practices through Pervasive Sensing and Farm Digital T,"Abstract— Corn is a versatile crop of global signiﬁcance that
forms a critical component of food systems for both human
and animal consumption. Among the corn varieties, hybrids
stand out due to improved genetics and disease resistance which
results in better yields and resilience. Conventional practices are
environmentally unfriendly due to adoption of inorganic practices
that lead to GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions which increase
the GWP (global warming potential). With a combination of
pervasive farm sensing and calibrated sustainable practices, one
can model the crop progression and its environment during a
season to maximise farm productivity while enriching the soil
and limiting GWP overheads to align with global sustainability
goals. For the 2022-23 Rabi season in India, we present a study
for a hybrid corn variety grown in an open farm that involved a
variety of sensing modalities: (a) soil sensing to ascertain ﬁeld
nutrient conditions, (b) micro-climate sensing of the farm for
corn-growth conduciveness, and (c) mobile participatory sensing
to monitor the crop stresses. A combination of AI and process-
based models as part of a digital twin of the farm were used
to consume the sensor data to continuously generate insights on
productivity measures such as crop yield and carbon footprint.
This allowed the organic sustainable practices for the farm to
be calibrated to suit speciﬁc needs that maximised productivity
as illustrated with the comparison presented against conventional
practices. Through this case-study, we show how pervasive multi-
modal sensing can play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable
precision agriculture in general and cultivation of corn hybrids

IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks, an adaptation layer 6LoWPAN
is sandwiched between network layer and data link layer. In
protocol stack of 6LoWPAN, data link layer is supported by two
protocols namely MAC and Radio Duty Cycle (RDC) protocols.
MAC protocol takes care of transmission and retransmissions
and RDC protocol will define sleep and wake-up cycles of
nodes. Growing interest in mobile IoT, made us exlore the
RDC protocols in the context of mobility. Since, duty cycle
affects the power efficiency of nodes, it is essential to choose the
efficient RDC protocol to increase the lifetime of the network
in mobile IoT applications. Existing works have focused on
the efficiency of RDC protocol in static scenarios however in
mobile scenarios, the need for an efficient RDC protocol is
enhanced due to the dynamic nature of the network. Since,
node mobility poses many challenges, it is essential to know
the impact of mobility on performance of the RDC protocol
to ensure network reliability and responsiveness. Thus, in this
work we have carried out experiments using Contiki OS/Cooja
simulator to evaluate the performance of different combinations
of MAC and RDC protocols in mobile scenarios with respect
to routing protocol, IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and
Lossy Networks (RPL). Random Way Point mobility model is

COMSOL Multiphysics to examine the response of skin to 
controlled prescribed displacement of 1000 μm with a step of 
50 μm from a spherical steel indenter with a diameter of 6.22

detection of objects that are present on the road for safe
operations in all scenarios. Computer vision techniques, which
inspect captured image attributes to identify the cluster of pixels
pertaining to a specific object, are employed for these purposes.
This necessitates a pixel-level understanding of the working of
the cameras and algorithms employed. This study endeavors to
experimentally determine the maximum range (i.e., the maximum
distance from the camera pinhole to the object) of any available
general RGB camera, up to which the employed algorithm can
accurately identify the object of a fixed dimension (in this case,
a pedestrian), keeping in mind that this range also depends
on the used algorithm and the training data. This dependence
is due to the requirement of object mapping on the sensor
plane for successful identification. The calculations of perspective
view with intrinsic camera parameters are used to correlate the
observations with theory for predictive capabilities. Furthermore,
this study compares various object detection algorithms trained

manuscripts-papers,"Advanced Wearable Platform for Continuous, Wireless Monitoring of Sweat Cortisol Shingirirai Chakoma","Abstract— Stress significantly impacts health, highlighting 
the need for precise and objective measurement methods, as 
conventional self-report questionnaires often lack reliability. 
Existing wearable technologies, utilizing physical sensors like 
electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response face specificity

Molecular biosensors targeting cortisol, a primary stress 
biomarker, provide a compelling alternative; however, 
traditional blood-based cortisol assays are invasive and 
impractical for continuous monitoring due to their complexity

inductance-capacitance transducer that translates cortisol 
concentrations into resonant frequency shifts with high 
sensitivity (~155kHz/log[µM]) over the physiological range of 0-
1μM. Integration with Near-Field Communication (NFC) 
technology enables seamless operation without batteries, while 
a 3D-printed microfluidic channel facilitates direct sweat 
sampling, allowing on-demand continuous monitoring of 
cortisol levels throughout daily activities. Validation of the

experiments the spectra of commercially sourced milk from 8 
brands with different fat contents (3-6%), a total of 16 samples, 
are recorded in the wavelength range of 190-800 nm. Principal 
component analysis is performed on these spectra The score 
plots of the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) 
enable a visual classification of the milk brands according to 
fat contents. Out of these 8 brands, one brand with 4.5% fat 
content is then selected for urea adulteration from 10mg/dL to 
2000 mg/dL. As in the previous case, the score plot of PC1 vs

calculated. It is demonstrated that RMSECV value is of the 
order of 3.8 while the R2 value is 0.81 for the adulterated 
samples. A confusion matrix was used, to further validate the 
accuracies. In summary, the present work demonstrates the

medical diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. This study 
introduces a novel approach by combining a multi-headed transformer 
model with the principles of a contextual multi-armed bandit 
framework to enhance decision-making in the detection and 
classification of harmful brain activities. The transformer model 
utilizes multiple ""expert"" heads, each trained to capture different 
aspects of the EEG signals, providing a comprehensive analysis of

manuscripts-papers,Multiple Smaller ArUco Markers based Marker Design for Optical Camera -based Surgical Navigation Sys,"Abstract— It has become increasingly common to use 
optical navigation system for various types of surgical 
procedures, and it has redefined the landscape of surgical 
procedures, especially for orthopedic surgeries. This system 
performs real-time tracking of various surgical and digitization 
tools. Frequently, such a system used either a passive reflective 
sphere marker or an active marker with LED sources and an 
infrared stereo-camera system for marker tracking. However, 
such systems are expensive and financially unviable for smaller 
healthcare facilities. ArUco marker-based navigation using a 
single camera has become popular in various applications, 
including surgical navigation, and can provide a low-cost but 
efficient solution. The present study suggests using a marker 
design consisting of multiple small arUco markers instead of a 
bigger arUco marker. Multiple arUco markers allow the 
estimation of internal translation and rotational errors within 
a marker, which can help in detecting inaccurate data points. 
In the present work, we experimented with two marker 
designs: one with four smaller markers (M4) and another with 
two smaller markers (M2). We compared their performance 
with a similar-sized single arUco marker (M1). Experimental 
outcomes showed that considering internal translation and 
rotational errors that can be computed for M4 and M2 
markers helps filter bad data points and minimizes the overall 
markers’ translation 
and 
rotational

errors. 
Additionally, different marker shapes other than squares can 
be designed by rearranging the smaller arUco markers.",

identifying a region's rainfall pattern and moisture availability. According to the probable agroclimatic scenario, the farmer should plan the cropping pattern. The
sustainable application of irrigation water to crop development will help progress the modern agricultural system. This leads to the definition of the Moisture
Adequacy Index (MAI), which will differ based on the agroclimatic region and the phenological stages of every crop. This study analyzes rainfall patterns and
estimates the Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI) for the Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone (LBVZ) of Assam, India, using 32 years (1990-2021) of rainfall and temperature
data. Annual and seasonal rainfall define the need for change in cropping patterns. From the findings, the agroclimatic atlas of cropping validate that direct-seeded
summer rice sowing can commence from the 13th Standard Meteorological Week (SMW) with MAI of 0.6-0.7. Kharif rice nursery sowing is optimal between the 21st
and 26th SMW, corresponding to MAI values of 0.8-",

manuscripts-papers,"Non-invasive method to detect potato quality in warehouse Shrikant Kapse PSRA TCS Research Pune , In","Abstract— Potatoes are one of the world's most important 
food crops, providing essential nutrients like carbohydrates, 
vitamins, and minerals to millions of people. They are versatile 
and consumed in various forms such as chips, fries, fritters etc., 
making them a dietary staple in many cultures. Potato wastage 
in warehouses and the supply chain is a significant issue, often 
driven by improper storage conditions such as fluctuating 
temperatures and humidity levels, which accelerate spoilage and 
lead to substantial weight loss and quality degradation. 
Inefficiencies in monitoring these conditions contribute to 
economic losses, highlighting the need for improved storage 
practices. In this work, a non-invasive method to detect quality 
of potatoes using an IoT based sensor system consisting of 
temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors has 
been described. CO2 respiration rate of potatoes was analyzed, 
and the resultant data was analyzed and compared with the 
weight loss in potatoes which was also measured from time to 
time. A correlation between weight loss measurements with CO2 
levels was observed, thus establishing a non-invasive method to 
assess potato quality continuously.  This proactive method 
enhances the ability to monitor and maintain optimal storage 
conditions, reducing spoilage and waste, and leading to better 
quality control and minimized losses in the supply chain.",

provides farmers with the opportunity to extend the shelf life of 
the prunes, reduce food wastage and increased profitability. While 
the system focused on Spondias purpurea, the system is highly

become an important topic of research. In this regard, the
project Robocoenosis puts forward an innovative concept of
establishing a symbiotic association of different living organisms

monitoring system. In this paper, we propose a novel biohybrid
sensor organ using freshwater mussels as biological sensors. The
behavior of mussels is related to the nature of their habitat. The
presence of toxic compounds, weather changes, and impromptu
human actions, to name a few, affect their behavior. The main
goal is to extend conventional long-term monitoring methods by
adding biohybrid sensor organs for a comprehensive study. Two

System (ECWMS) leverages advancements in digital image processing and 
eye-tracking technology to enhance the mobility and independence of 
individuals with severe motor impairments. This project integrates 
Raspberry Pi and OpenCV to create a cost-effective and efficient solution 
that translates eye movements into wheelchair control commands. The 
system is designed to operate in real-time, providing an intuitive interface 
for users who may find traditional joystick or switch-based controls 
challenging to use. Despite demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness, the 
current prototype faces several challenges. The processing time, currently 
around four seconds, introduces a delay that impacts the responsiveness of 
the wheelchair. Additionally, the system's performance is highly dependent 
on lighting conditions, performing optimally in well-lit environments and 
struggling in lowlight conditions. Safety features, such as obstacle 
detection and automatic stopping, are critical and need further refinement 
to prevent unintended movements and collisions. Future enhancements aim 
to address these limitations by improving the real-time processing 
capabilities and making the system adaptable to varying lighting 
conditions. Integration with smart home devices and additional control 
functionalities will further enhance user independence. Extensive field 
testing, collaboration with healthcare professionals, and iterative 
development based on user feedback are essential for creating a 
commercially viable and user-friendly product. The ultimate goal is to 
provide a reliable and accessible assistive technology that significantly

manuscripts-papers,Flexible Organic Photodetectors with PEIE Electron Transport Layer for Ambient Light PPG Sensing Hos,"Abstract—The focus of this research is on developing and 
studying flexible organic photodetectors (OPDs) that utilize 
polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) as the electron transport 
layer (ETL). The flexible OPD employs a conductive PEDOT: PSS 
anode on a flexible PET substrate. By using polyethyleneimine 
ethoxylated (PEIE) as an Electron Transport Layer (ETL) in 
flexible OPDs, the dark current is reduced by one order of 
magnitude and the photocurrent is increased by 60% at -2V bias. 
This results in a 14 dB increase in the linear dynamic range (LDR) 
compared to conventional LiF ETL in flexible OPDs. By making 
these improvements, the flexible OPD with PEIE can detect 
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals even in ambient light 
without LED usage. Acquiring the PPG signal under ambient light 
conditions opens possibilities for the development of low power 
PPG sensing wearables.",

manuscripts-papers,An on-chip all-digital low-mismatch CMOS process monitoring sensor circuit for accurate process sens,"Abstract—As 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
processes 
continue to scale down, variability-induced process shifts 
have become a significant challenge, impacting both yield 
and performance of a chip. Die-Die and within-die process 
variations can occur during the manufacturing cycle of a 
silicon wafer leading to mismatches in electrical parameters 
of circuits thereby impacting the performance and power of 
a chip. To mitigate the impacts of these variations, larger 
guard bands during circuit design are taken leading to 
performance and area loss. To improve yield and reduce 
design margins, information regarding the process centering 
of a silicon die therefore becomes crucial. This paper 
proposes an on-chip all-digital low mismatch sensor circuit 
to monitor ON-current variations of nMOS and pMOS 
independently. The dependency of ON-current on threshold 
voltage makes this circuit useful  for sensing process 
variations. The proposed architecture enables high sensing 
accuracy and area efficiency by using an inverter-based 
topology. For a 60 stage sample size for nMOS and 84 stage 
for pMOS, the sensor area is 0.00096 mm2 with worst-case 
standby power consumption of 600 µW at 0.8 V operation. 
The solution therefore enables low-cost implementation for 
applications such as post-silicon tuning using adaptive

accuracy through model vs silicon mismatch. Detailed 
simulation and silicon results in 28-nm Fully Depleted

the varying coordinate systems of each point in a frame, caused
by the movement of the vehicle on which LiDAR is mounted.
The paper discusses the underlying causes of this distortion,
particularly in oscillating LiDAR systems, and presents a method
to correct it through LiDAR and IMU (Inertial Measurement

manuscripts-papers,Digital Filter Design For Enhanced Signal Processing In PPG-Based Health Monitoring Systems Uthra T ,"Abstract—This paper details the development and applica-
tion of a more efficient Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter,
specifically the Chebyshev Type II, to replace the memory-
demanding moving average filter in real-time signal processing
for microcontroller-based systems. The primary goal is to lower
memory usage and reduce signal detection delays, both of which
are essential for resource-constrained embedded systems. The
filter design was meticulously executed using MATLAB, involving
comprehensive stability assessments such as pole-zero analysis,
impulse response evaluation, and Bode plot examination, which
verified the stability and effectiveness of third and fourth-order
Chebyshev Type II filters for processing photoplethysmogram
(PPG) signals. Among these, the third-order filter demonstrated
superior performance, particularly regarding phase stability
and frequency response. The digital filter was implemented
using the Cascade (Biquad) Form, which improved numerical
stability, modularity, and the precision of filter coefficient control,
minimizing rounding errors in digital applications. The resulting
system, employing derived difference equations, offers quicker
and more dependable PPG signal processing with decreased
memory requirements and reduced signal delay. Future studies
might investigate further optimizing filter performance by rear-
ranging biquad sections, potentially enhancing the effectiveness
of real-time signal processing.",

manuscripts-papers,Digital Passport for Fresh Food Traceability Mudra Kapoor Physical Sciences Research Area Tata Consu,"Abstract— The growing population, increasing food 
demand, limited cultivable land, and erratic climate place 
significant pressure on agricultural output. Ironically, one-
third of food intended for human consumption is wasted 
worldwide. Policymakers are addressing both food 
production and waste reduction challenges. In this paper, 
we propose a unique concept: the Digital Passport for 
tracing fresh food. The Digital Passport is a unique code 
affixed to the packaging of fresh fruits or vegetables, 
carrying comprehensive information about the produce 
from origin to disposal of packaging. This information can 
be decoded by consumers or supermarkets to trace the 
food's source of production, plucking date, storage 
conditions, current nutritional value, environmental 
impact, ripening stage, and potential repurposing options 
if overripe. We have developed the Food Application, 
which leverages our Food Digital Twin technology. The 
Food Digital Twin solution involves synchronized 
monitoring of various physico-chemical attributes, such as 
time-series sensory data, chemical composition variations, 
and images. AI/ML and physics-based models, trained on 
these attributes, predict food quality. These hybrid models 
act as soft sensors in real-time, allowing stakeholders to 
make dynamic decisions related to repricing, recycling, 
reusing, and repurposing based on food quality 
assessments. Consumers can scan the QR code on the fruit 
packaging and an image of the fruit to obtain information 
about its history and status. This system aims to create 
transparency and build consumer trust by verifying the 
authenticity of purchases. For supermarkets, the system 
aids in inventory control by capturing fruit status, 
predicting shelf life, adjusting prices, clearing stock, and 
selling surplus to food processing companies at reduced 
rates. The concept is designed to minimize food waste, 
facilitate better decision-making for buyers and sellers, 
ensure consumption of climacteric fruit at its peak 
nutritional value, and foster a sustainable food ecosystem

PSS/graphene-based RFID gas sensor for assessing 
the freshness of thermally processed milk. Acetone 
was selected as a marker VOC for milk spoilage. 
Initially, an RFID gas sensor was developed using 
bare PEDOT:PSS as the gas sensing layer, which 
demonstrated the ability to detect acetone VOC. 
However, the detection limit (LOD) was found to be 
poor (500 ppm of acetone). We observed frequency 
and amplitude shifts in the RFID sensor response 
under different concentrations of acetone. For 
instance, an increase in amplitude of 9.94 dB and a 
frequency shift of 30 kHz was observed compared to the 
signal of the sensor in the presence of air. In subsequent 
studies, we plan to enhance the sensor’s sensitivity

future stress patterns, and may not offer timely interventions. This 
paper presents a novel framework for stress detectionduring sleep, 
leveraging parameters such as snoring range, respiration rate, 
body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye 
movement, and heart rate. These parameters are collected from 
various wearables and fitness trackers that are used in day-to-day 
life. The proposed system employs a Decision Tree algorithm, to 
examine data related to sleep patterns. Using this algorithm, the 
system can predict the levels of stress individuals may experience 
based on sensor data. This approach is more comprehensive for 
detecting and managing stress. The existingmethods are based on 
communication (such as text analysis), proved an accuracy of 
60%. Whereas the machine learning model for stress detection 
proposed in this project has an accuracy of 97%.

manuscripts-papers,Simulation study comparing two passive micro- mixture designs for the enrichment of mixing efficienc,"Abstract— The objective of this study is to evaluate and 
compare the output efficiency of two micro-mixtures based on 
the inlet flow rate, diffusion coefficient, and device design. The 
micro-mixtures were designed in the 2-dimensional platform 
of Multiphysics software. The inlet flow rate was considered 
as 1µL/min, 5 µL/min, and 10 µL/min respectively, and the 
diffusion coefficient was considered as 15.3 X 10-10 m2/s. Based 
on these input parameters the output parameters like velocity 
profile, pressure profile, and resultant concentration after 
mixing were computed using stationary study.  The mixing 
efficiency for both designs was then calculated from the 
output results. It is seen that the design having constricted 
pillars at different locations across the device has higher 
mixing efficiency compared to its similar counterparts 
without pillars.    This low flow rate passive micro-mixtures 
with high mixing efficiencies are useful for accurate control 
and observation of reaction dynamics in biological and 
chemical studies for ""lab-on-a-chip"" applications.",
manuscripts-papers,Utilization of Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol for Smart City Application Tushar Suresh Mote1 D,"Abstract— The rapid development of smart cities requires 
efficient management of resources and infrastructure. 
One of the critical aspects is the deployment of wireless 
sensor networks (WSNs) for various applications, such as 
environmental monitoring, traffic management, and 
energy distribution. This paper explores the utilization of 
energy-efficient clustering protocols to enhance the 
performance and lifespan of WSNs in smart city 
applications. We compare the performance of k-means 
clustering and the Adaptive Threshold Residual Energy 
Efficient Clustering Protocol (ATREEN) based on 
metrics such as energy consumption and the number of 
alive nodes over time. Our results demonstrate that 
ATREEN outperforms compared to K-means clustering 
protocol. The choice of protocol depends on the specific 
requirements and constraints of the smart city 
environment.",
