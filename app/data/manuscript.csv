1571039578,A Novel Method of Generating Complex Sine Wave in Automative Sensing Application,Track 09 Sensors Interfaces and Sensors Analytics,"Machine learning has advanced rapidly, specifically in the application of automotive sensing[1]. One of the significant challenges in this area is to accurately estimate the range and direction of targets while using FMCW radars in moving vehicles. To address this challenge, it is necessary to compute the gold-Fourier
Kaluri (gFK) method efficiently. We propose a novel method for generating complex sine waves using a 2nd order auto-regressive model, which requires just two multiplications and two additions. These sine waves are used to evaluate the gFK objective function at any given frequency and to scale the peak. Our lean computational method achieves the goal of implementing simple controllers, and we also compare it with conventional computation to report on our findings.",13,8/31/24 18:56,ithenticate,,"Kaluri V Rangarao (University of Hyderabad, USA & Hyderabad, India); Atul Negi (University of Hyderabad, India)"

1571052208,Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm to Detect Human Stress,"Track 07 IoT, Wearables and Immersive Technologies","Stress is the physiological and psychological reaction of the body to demands or pressures from outside sources. Stress can interfere with sleep, making it harder to sleep or stay asleep. On the other hand, insufficient sleep can make people more stressed, leading to a vicious cycle of stress and sleeplessness. Stress management and the adoption of restful sleeping practices are crucial for general well-being. Current stress detection models mainly focus on in- person interactions. These models have limitations such as narrow in scope and rely heavily on face-to- face or online interactions, which can lead to subjective interpretations and privacy issues. Additionally, they lack in crucial physiological signals of stress, cannot predict future stress patterns, and may not offer timely interventions. This paper presents a novel framework for stress detectionduring sleep, leveraging parameters such as snoring range, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, and heart rate. These parameters are collected from various wearables and fitness trackers that are used in day-to-day life. The proposed system employs a Decision Tree algorithm, to examine data related to sleep patterns. Using this algorithm, the system can predict the levels of stress individuals may experience based on sensor data. This approach is more comprehensive for detecting and managing stress. The existingmethods are based on communication (such as text analysis), proved an accuracy of 60%. Whereas the machine learning model for stress detection proposed in this project has an accuracy of 97%.

Ironically, one-third of food intended for human consumption is wasted worldwide. Policymakers are addressing both food production and waste reduction challenges. In this paper, we propose a unique concept: the Digital Passport for tracing fresh food. The Digital Passport is a unique code affixed to the packaging of fresh fruits or vegetables, carrying comprehensive information about the produce from origin to disposal of packaging. This information can be decoded by consumers or supermarkets to trace the food's source of production, plucking date, storage conditions, current nutritional value, environmental impact, ripening stage, and potential repurposing options if overripe. We have developed the Food Application, which leverages our Food Digital Twin technology.

One of the renowned quantification techniques happens to be Sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which is underlined by the fact that a capture antibody molecule specifically binding to an antigen molecule is, in turn, associated with a primary antibody. The primary antibody can often be bound to a secondary antibody. The primary or secondary antibody is linked with an enzyme specific to a chromogenic substrate, which converts the chromogenic substrate to a product visible to us when exposed to a stop solution. The stop solution alters the pH to increase the contrast of the colour change for ease of detection. This colour change is stabilized with the introduction of stop solution, which is, in turn, essential for absorbance readings performed in a plate reader. In this study, BDNF acts as the antigen whose concentration is usually proportional to an individual's cognitive ability and even memory. As per August Beer's law, the extent of absorbance at a precise wavelength is proportional to the antigen concentration. With the generated data, 4 Parameter Logistic (PL) sigmoidal curve is obtained by keeping the concentration (nanogram per mililitre) at the x-axis as being an independent variable and absorbance at 450 nanometres at the y-axis as being a dependent variable. 4PL Sigmoidal curve considers four principal parameters, which are minimum value (at 0 dose) and maximum value (at infinite doses), which can be obtained, inflection point (halfway of the S-shaped curve), and Hill's slope (steepness at inflection point).",13,8/31/24 18:57,ithenticate,,"Suman Kalyan Das (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India)"

Die-Die and within-die process variations can occur during the manufacturing cycle of a silicon wafer leading to mismatches in electrical parameters of circuits thereby impacting the performance and power of a chip. To mitigate the impacts of these variations, larger guard bands during circuit design are taken leading to performance and area loss.

Research initiatives at present range from using Satellite images for monitoring crop maturity based on NDVI to assessing the content of sucrose by timely collection of crop samples, then clarifying them traditionally for measurement of sugar concentration using a Polarimeter, which is expensive, time-consuming and requires skilled labor. We conceptualized a simple-to-use portable optofluidic measurement device, based on the GOD-POD enzymatic reaction of glucose to get colorimetric output in the visible spectrum range. We report a new design where the difference in free glucose and total glucose (derived from sucrose) can be measured at 505 nm and can also be applicable to various other assays that requires the measurement of the difference in optical density of the target constituent (sucrose of 10 -25 % in our case) and interfering constituent (glucose) in a single step. We optimized the GOD-POD experiment method to get repeatable optical Absorbance within a pathlength of 2 mm for the analysis concentration of 10-25 mg/ml which is the dynamic range of sucrose in the crop.

1571074226,Adaptive Prediction of Pests and Diseases in Tomato With Granular Ambient and Field Sensing,Track 01 Agriculture and Food Technology,"Prevalence of multiple pests and diseases in the cultivation of tomato pose a significant threat to crop yield and quality. Early prediction and detection are critical to mitigating these risks. Yet, traditional methods often lack the precision and adaptiveness necessary for timely interventions. In this study, we explore how granular ambient and field-level sensing could be used for the effective prediction of tomato pests and diseases. We collect and analyze micro-climate conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours, along with field-specific variables associated with crop and pest incidents from the stress hotspot with mobile sensing. For this study, we have taken a tomato belt from a district in Tamil Nadu as our region of interest where the forecasting objective is supported by automated detection of reported conditions. This fusion of data not only allows for refined learning of microclimatic factors influencing pest and disease outbreak but also provides the ability to adapt to rapid changes in infestation trends. With Early Blight disease in tomato, as an example, we evaluate various frameworks to develop the proposed modeland present the results with a comparative view illustrating its benefts over earlier work.",10,9/15/24 18:50,ithenticate,,"Vidit Patil, Swagatam Bose Choudhury, Rushikesh Dattatraya Kulat and Sanat Sarangi (Tata Consultancy Services, India); Dinesh Singh (TCS & TCS Research and Innovation, India); Srinivasu Pappula (Tata Consultancy Services, India)"
1571074246,IoT-Enabled Portable ECG System Embedded With Power Gating,Track 03 Medical and Digital Healthcare,"Heart diseases can be identified by measuring heart's activities by means of monitoring the generated electrical signals through an electrocardiogram (ECG). Accurate diagnosis of any type of chest pain is crucial for the heart patients. Considering the catastrophe of the health infrastructure in rural India, there is a need of developing low-cost, portable and reliable ECG systems. In the proposed work, we implemented a three electrode ECG monitoring system using electrodes (RA, LA, RL) along with in-house developed an analog front-end (AFE). AFE comprises of AD8232 signal conditioning IC (specifically designed for the ECG system) and a microcontroller. We have designed the portable system on printed circuit board (PCB) having form factor of about 60x28 mm2 and power consumption of about 66 mW. To reduce the power consumption of the system, a programmable power gating scheme has been implemented which allows the power to entire system delivered periodically. In this reported system we have kept it wake up for 2 minutes per hour to take the data from the subject, process and send to the server using internet of things (IoT) technology. We compared our system with 7 competing systems and found it performed better than all on form factor, cost and energy consumption.",10,9/15/24 18:50,ithenticate,,"Partthu Kalleda (DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, India); Kamlesh Patle (DA-IICT, India); Vinay Palaparthy and Anil Roy (DAIICT, India)"

1571074365,Nonlinear Diffractive Imaging Through Strongly Scattering Media Using Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm,Track 03 Medical and Digital Healthcare,"2-D diffractive imaging under the strongly scattering regime is a simple and efficient method for imaging biological and non-biological specimens, unlike the classical reconstruction algorithm which works on linear models viz. Born and Rytov approximation which is limited to weakly scattering regimes and applicable only to imaging of thin samples, recently nonlinear models which account for multiple scattering and lead to better reconstruction quality have been explored. We propose a non-linear model with adaptive step size minimization using Levenberg Marquardt (LM) inequality which shows better reconstruction quality with smooth convergence utilizing the Lippmann Schwinger equation for modeling wave propagation through a highly scattering sample with contrast ~ 0.2001 using single-shot imaging in transmission mode. Reconstruction of refractive index distribution from the holographic measurement of Lossy and Lossless object with total variation regularization and non-negativity constraint is proposed. The comparative assessment of the proposed method with Born approximation accelerated forward backward splitting and FISTA for reconstruction of 2D synthetic object shows better reconstruction with SSIM of 0.94419 for holographic reconstruction.",21,9/15/24 18:50,ithenticate,,"Asim Asrar (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India); Pranab Kumar Dutta (IIT kharagpur, India)"
