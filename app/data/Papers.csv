1,Power Supply Efficiency Aware Server Allocation in Data Centers,"Abstract—We address the issue of power efﬁciency at a
relatively high level of abstraction – tasks allocated on server
systems. The domain is that of requests/tasks being forwarded
to clusters of servers in data centers. We target the power
delivery mechanism – speciﬁcally, the power supply unit, and
suggest techniques to distribute workload in a way that the total
power is reduced by factoring this important parameter. We
formulate the overall power minimization as an optimization
problem that takes into account the variation of compute power
and power supply efﬁciency with workload. Our proposed
heuristic gives results that are close to that returned by
standard NLP solvers, but takes a fraction of the execution
time, making it a powerful alternative in a practical online
workload distribution strategy."
1,Automated Optimal Dispatching of Service Requests,"Abstract—In the services domain, the customers raise issues
and service requests in the form of tickets. There is a pool
of personnel who work on these tickets and resolve them.
The problem at hand is to dispatch these tickets to the most
appropriate personnel. Optimality is applied to metrics like the
mean service time taken to resolve a ticket, the fair sharing of
workload among the personnel, and the size and conﬁguration of
the pool. The current state of the art involves a human dispatcher
for assigning incoming service requests. Though intelligent, a
human dispatcher can be suboptimal with respect to the above-
mentioned objectives due to the large space of parameter values
to be considered. Further, there exists an opportunity to achieve
high-level goals such as on-the-job training, eliminating over-
production, and workload balancing among personnel through
smarter dispatch decisions. For example, target skill levels of
personnel can be achieved by assigning them tickets requiring
those skills increasingly. Also, overproduction can be controlled
by dispatching only those tickets that otherwise would be in the
danger of missing deadline (SLO) constraints. Our work involves
the design and implementation of an automated dispatcher which
would take various characteristics of the tickets and the pool state
as input and recommend an intelligent dispatching decision for
the tickets, based on the above-mentioned goals and constraints.

2,A Novel Adaptive 360&#x00B0; Livestreaming with Graph Representation Learning based FoV Prediction,"Abstract—The exceptionally high bandwidth requirements as-
sociated with the delivery of live 360° video content pose signif-
icant challenges in the current network context. An avenue for
addressing this bandwidth challenge is to use the limited network
resources for sending the user’s Field-of-View (FoV) tiles at a high
resolution, instead of transmitting all frame components at high
quality. However, precisely forecasting the FoV for 360° live video
content distribution remains a complex endeavor due to the lack
of pre-knowledge on user viewing behaviors. In this paper, we
present GL360, a novel 360° transmission framework, which em-
ploys Graph Representation Learning for FoV prediction. First,
we analyze the interaction between users and tiles in panoramic
videos utilizing a dynamic heterogeneous Relational Graph Con-
volutional Network (RGCN), which facilitates efficient user and
tile embedding representation learning. Secondly, we propose
an online dynamic heterogeneous graph learning (DHGL)-based
algorithm to dynamically capture the time-varying features of the
user’s viewing behaviors with limited prior knowledge. Further,
we design a FoV-aware content delivery algorithm that allows
the edge servers to determine the video tiles’ resolution for
each accessed user. Experimental results based on real traces
demonstrate how our solution outperforms four other solutions
in terms of FoV prediction and network performance."
2,A Novel Distributed Multi-Source Optimal Rate Control Solution for HTTP Live Video Streaming,"Abstract—HTTP live streaming delivers dynamically video
content with varying bitrates to accommodate the dynamic
real-time bandwidth ﬂuctuations while considering diverse user
preferences and device capabilities. Existing ﬂow control solutions
do not provide support for new features such as multi-source
content transmission. In this paper, we propose a distributed
multi-source rate control optimization algorithm (DMRCA) that
maximizes the overall network bandwidth utility and improves
viewer Quality of Experience (QoE). First, we model the rate
control problem as a dual-optimized multi-source and multi-rate
problem. Then, we decompose the problem into sub-problems
of source rate selection and user rate adaptation and we prove
that solving the original problem is equivalent to solving these
two sub-problems. Furthermore, we propose DMRCA as a fully
distributed algorithm to solve these sub-problems and derive
an optimal solution and we discuss DMRCA’s complexity and
convergence. Finally, through a series of simulation tests, we
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared
to alternative state-of-the-art solutions.

2,Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Moving Target Defense for Multicast in Software-Defined Satellite Networks,"Abstract—The development of LEO satellite networks (LSN)
makes them a potential solution to deliver broadcast/multicast
traffic to deploy and upgrade massive amounts of Internet of
Things (IoT) devices in future 6G networks. However, inherent
resource constraints of LSN leave them vulnerable to a mul-
titude of security threats, most notably distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attacks. Existing solutions are primarily based
on machine learning detection methods which are incapable of
defending against unknown zero-day attacks. This paper presents
an innovative solution leveraging deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) to create a dynamic multicast tree based on moving target
defense (MTD), aimed at enhancing the security of multicast
services in LSN. The proposed solution adopts an adaptive
orbital tree mutation (AOTM) scheme that dynamically adjusts
multicast tree configurations considering quality of service (QoS)
constraints to avoid attacks on vulnerable nodes. Simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the AOTM scheme, showcasing
its superior defense success rates compared to existing state-of-
the-art algorithms."
2,Deterrence of Adversarial Perturbations: Moving Target Defense for Automatic Modulation Classification in Wireless Communication Systems,"Abstract—Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays
an indispensable role in wireless communication systems. Deep
learning-based AMC has become the mainstream solution due to
its high accuracy and no need for manual feature engineering.
However, every coin has two sides. DL-based AMC is susceptible
to adversarial perturbations, which are carefully crafted to be
superimposed on the transmitted signals in an iteratively try-
and-error manner, resulting in incorrect classification. In this
paper, we propose a model diversity-based moving target de-
fense mechanism (MD-MTD), which employs multiple classifiers
and switches periodically, preventing intelligent attackers from
deducing universal adversarial perturbations (UAP). Besides,
to jointly optimize the robustness and accuracy of different
AMC models to be trained, we design a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) module. It is worth mentioning
that the proposed algorithm significantly mitigates the curse of
dimensionality during the large-scale training process via inte-
grating value-decomposition networks and illegal action masking,
improving the feasibility of our solution in real-world wireless
communication systems. Experimental results on the GNU radio
dataset also exhibit the remarkable advantages of our method in
terms of convergence and defense performance."
2,Patronus: Countering Model Poisoning Attacks in Edge Distributed DNN Training,"Abstract—As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are evolving
in complexity to meet the demands of novel applications, a
single device becomes insufﬁcient for training, leading to the
emergence of distributed DNN training. However, this evolution
exposes a gap in research surrounding security vulnerabilities
on model poisoning attacks, especially in model parallel setups,
an area that has been scarcely studied. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Patronus, an approach that counters model poisoning
attacks in distributed DNN training, accommodating both data
and model parallelism. With the employment of Loss-aware
Credit Evaluation, Patronus scores each participating client.
Based on the continuously updated credit, malicious clients
are isolated and detected after multiple epochs by Shufﬂing-
based Isolation Mechanism. Additionally, the training system is
reinforced by Byzantine Fault-tolerant Aggregation to minimize
malicious client impacts. Comprehensive experiments conﬁrm
Patronus’s superior reliable and efﬁcient performance over the
existing methods under attack scenarios."
2,VAAC-IM: Viewing Area Adaptive Control in Immersive Media Transmission,"ABSTRACT
The viewport in immersive media, exemplified by panoramic video,
corresponds to the field of view (FoV) and significantly impacts both
the volume of data transmission and the user experience. However,
the instantaneous and highly dynamic nature of user interactions
poses a challenge to the traditional segment-based transmission
mode, creating a conflict between the need for real-time respon-
siveness and the structured nature of data delivery. It results in the
transmission of substantial redundant data, leading to wastage of
valuable resources. In this paper, we analyze data from open-source
dataset and our self-collected records to investigate the interac-
tive characteristics of viewer in immersive scenes, e.g., focus time,
viewing area scope, and movement direction. Based on statistical
inferences, we introduce the concept of extended field of view (EoV)
to describe irregular viewing areas that mimic the moving features
of the human visual field. A motion-aware tile-based viewing area
adaptive control scheme, termed VAAC-IM, is designed for trans-
mitting immersive media flexibly. We model viewing area control
process as a constrained submodular minimization problem, and
design a greedy search-based strategy to dynamically control irreg-
ular EoV area. Finally, we perform a comprehensive validation. The
results demonstrate that VAAC-IM significantly enhances perfor-
mance in terms of reducing black edge coverage, minimizing data
volume, lowering latency, and improving overall user experience.

2,Safeguarding Privacy and Integrity of Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo IoRT Environments: A Moving Target Defense Approach,"Abstract
Bridging the gap between the Internet of Things 
and collaborative robots, the recent advancements 
in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) aim at 
significantly improving production and operation 
efficiency and quality. As the scope and com-
plexity of IoRT continue to expand, involving also 
very large numbers of robots, there is a need for 
employment of innovative solutions such as fed-
erated learning. However, this growing demand 
is accompanied by multiple challenges, including 
threats to data privacy and model integrity. Besides, 
the heterogeneity of the robots and their interac-
tion, multiplies these challenges. In this paper, we 
discuss the key concerns of collaborative training in 
IoRT, and propose a shuffling-based moving target 
defense approach for federated learning in hetero-
geneous cross-silo IoRT environments (FedMTD). 
Based on a hierarchical training structure with 
node clustering, FedMTD bounds heterogeneity by 
domains, thereby minimizing the learning error and 
privacy loss. It also enhances resistance to poison-
ing attacks through decentralized credit evaluation. 
Experimental results show that FedMTD brings sig-
nificant improvements in learning performance, 
privacy enhancement, and poisoning resistance."
2,MR-FFL: A Stratified Community-Based Mutual Reliability Framework for Fairness-Aware Federated Learning in Heterogeneous UAV Networks,"Abstract—Fairness-aware federated learning (FFL) plays a
crucial role in mitigating bias against speciﬁc demographic
groups (e.g., gender, race, and occupation) during collaborative
training. Along with the ever-emerging new attack paradigms
like gradient leakage and model poisoning, the reliability of
FFL also obtains lots of research attention. Either UAV nodes
or FFL aggregators could be untrusted adversaries. Although
multiple security mechanisms involving encryption, obfuscation,
Byzantine-robustness, and detection have been proposed, con-
crete to UAV networks, the majority of existing solutions are
unfeasible due to high heterogeneity and limited resources among
participants. Hence, in this article, we propose mutually reliable
FFL (MR-FFL), a stratiﬁed community-based framework to
facilitate privacy protection (FFL aggregator’s reliability) and
poisoning elimination (client nodes’ reliability) jointly for FFL
in heterogeneous UAV networks. We ﬁrst divide UAV nodes into
both peer communities (PCs) and colleague communities (CCs)
according to cross-participant similarity and task-oriented ﬁtness,
respectively. Thus, the arbitrarily settled learning tasks following
fair principles can be efﬁciently completed by ﬁne-tuned CCs,
even in the presence of a large degree of heterogeneity among
PCs. Then, we integrate community-speciﬁc differential privacy
into the MR-FFL process, to achieve privacy ampliﬁcation as
well as efﬁcient and personal collaborative training at the
same time. More importantly, we proposed a community-based
credit evaluation to resist poisoning attacks in heterogeneous
environments. The results on several standard data sets also
highlight the performance of MR-Fed in terms of fairness,
accuracy, and integrity jointly."
2,"Joint Task Offloading, Resource Allocation, and Trajectory Design for Multi-UAV Cooperative Edge Computing With Task Priority","Abstract—Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a
solution to address the demands of computation-intensive network
services by providing computational capabilities at the network
edge, thus reducing service delays. Due to the ﬂexible deployment,
wide coverage and reliable wireless communication, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed to assist MEC. This
paper investigates the task ofﬂoading problem in a UAV-assisted
MEC system with collaboration of multiple UAVs, highlighting
task priorities and binary ofﬂoading mode. We deﬁned the system
gain based on energy consumption and task delay. The joint op-
timization of UAVs’ trajectory design, binary ofﬂoading decision,
computation resources allocation, and communication resources
management is formulated as a mixed integer programming prob-
lem with the goal of maximizing the long-term average system gain.
Considering the discrete-continuous hybrid action space of this
problem, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm based on the latent space to solve it. The evaluation re-
sults demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms three
state-of-the-art alternative solutions in terms of task delay and
system gain.

2,PTCC: A Privacy-Preserving and Trajectory Clustering-Based Approach for Cooperative Caching Optimization in Vehicular Networks,"Abstract—5G vehicular networks provide abundant multimedia
services among mobile vehicles. However, due to the mobility of
vehicles, large-scale mobile trafﬁc poses a challenge to the core
network load and transmission latency. It is difﬁcult for existing
solutions to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of vehicular
networks. Besides, the sensitivity of vehicle trajectories also brings
privacy concerns in vehicular networks. To address these problems,
we propose a privacy-preserving and trajectory clustering-based
framework for cooperative caching optimization (PTCC) in vehic-
ular networks, which includes two tasks. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst
task, we ﬁrst apply differential privacy technologies to add noise
to vehicle trajectories. In addition, a data aggregation model is
provided to make the trade-off between aggregation accuracy and
privacy protection. In order to analyze similar behavioral vehicles,
trajectory clustering is then achieved by utilizing machine learning
algorithms. In the second task, we construct a cooperative caching
objective function with the transmission latency. Afterwards, the
multi-agent deep Q network (MADQN) is leveraged to obtain the
goal of caching optimization, which can achieve low delay. Finally,
extensive simulation results verify that our framework respectively
improves the QoS up to 9.8% and 12.8% with different ﬁle num-
bers and caching capacities, compared with other state-of-the-art
solutions."
2,Interaction Trust-Driven Data Distribution for Vehicle Social Networks: A Matching Theory Approach,"Abstract—Due to the rapid expansion of the Internet of Vehi-
cles (IoVs), service providers deploy roadside units (RSUs), and
base stations (BSs) close to vehicles. They can provide vehicles
with computational ofﬂoading services quickly. In the context
of vehicle social networks, where vehicles can communicate
and share data with each other, the security and efﬁciency of
data distribution are crucial. Unfortunately, the open nature of
RSU BSs makes them vulnerable to malicious attackers, hence
affecting the quality of the user experience. This article proposes
a security trust degree incentive-based evaluation mechanism that
calculates the security trust degree of vehicle users to RSU BSs
through the continuous interaction between them in order to
effectively address the aforementioned issues. Additionally, taking
into account the competitive nature of task computation ofﬂoad-
ing between vehicle users and BSs, a stable matching algorithm
is used to match each vehicle user with the most appropriate
BS so that they can work together to prevent competition in
task ofﬂoading and improve task ofﬂoading efﬁciency. Due to the
limited number of BS matches and the dynamic position changes
of vehicle users, we further increase the data distribution efﬁ-
ciency by calculating the vehicle user degree of relationship and
connection probability to match vehicle users with similar pref-
erences. Finally, our proposed scheme is validated via numerous
simulations with enhanced security service performance in terms
of vehicle task ofﬂoading, while data distribution efﬁciency are
effectively improved."
2,Task-Driven Cooperative Internet of the Robotic Things Crowdsourcing: From the Perspective of Hierarchical Game-Theoretic,"Abstract—The rapid advancement in robotics technology has
catalyzed the emergence of Internet of the Robotic Things crowd-
sourcing, a novel paradigm in the digital economy era. However,
the escalating complexity of crowdsourcing tasks, coupled with
the constrained resources of robot nodes and the diverse demands
of stakeholders, has resulted in inefficiency, which poses a signifi-
cant challenge to the burgeoning robot crowdsourcing market in
IoT. To address these challenges, we develop a comprehensive
analytical model that encapsulates the interests of both task
scheduler nodes and robotic nodes within Internet of Things,
which integrates various factors such as communication, com-
putation, mobility, latency, and energy, thereby tailoring utility
functions for different stakeholders. Secondly, we propose a Task-
driven Robotic Crowdsourcing strategy based on Hierarchical
Game (TRC-HG), which conceptualizes TNs and RNs as rational
entities with sequential actions. At the first layer, the interaction
between participants is transformed into a Stackelberg game.
This aids TNs in determining optimal pricing strategies while
guiding RNs toward the most efficient task-completion strategies.
Furthermore, we delve into the collaborative dynamics within
the RNs, a cooperative coalition formation strategy at the
second layer is established, which iteratively determines node
responsibilities and coalition members. The Nash stability and
optimality of coalition are ensured, thereby maximizing the utility
of RNs. Finally, we validate the performance through a series of
high-fidelity simulation experiments. These experiment results,
benchmarked against classical methods, highlight significant
improvements in terms of latency, energy consumption, and
cooperative efficiency."
2,CoLive: Edge-Assisted Clustered Learning Framework for Viewport Prediction in 360<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> Live Streaming,"Abstract—The exceptionally high bandwidth requirement for
delivering high-quality live 360◦video poses a signiﬁcant challenge
to current network capacity. Mitigating such bandwidth starvation
necessitates accurate ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) prediction to focus limited
resources on the viewer’s area of interest. However, FoV prediction
for live 360◦streaming can be complex due to the time-sensitive
nature of live content and the limited knowledge available for
model training. Our paper introduces a novel framework, CoLive,
for predicting the FoV in 360◦live streaming. CoLive accelerates
FoV prediction by ofﬂoading model training from viewers to
the edge and migrating saliency feature detection to the server
side. Observations on user clustering of viewing behaviors further
motivate us to propose a novel dynamic clustered learning
algorithm. The algorithm dynamically groups users according to
their model update gradients and enables them to train a shared
model that better suits their viewing preferences. We conduct
extensive experiments on the public 360◦video datasets and
demonstrate that CoLive outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in
terms of prediction performance and bandwidth savings."
2,Energy-Aware MPTCP Scheduling in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques,"Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-efﬁcient scheduling scheme for multi-path TCP (MPTCP)
in heterogeneous wireless networks, aiming to minimize energy consumption while ensuring low
latency and high throughput. Each MPTCP sub-ﬂow is controlled by an agent that cooperates
with other agents using the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm.
This approach enables the agents to learn decentralized policies through centralized training and
decentralized execution. The scheduling problem is modeled as a multi-agent decision-making
task. The proposed energy-efﬁcient scheduling scheme, referred to as EE-MADDPG, demonstrates
signiﬁcant energy savings while maintaining lower latency and higher throughput compared to
other state-of-the-art scheduling techniques. By adopting a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
approach, the agents can learn efﬁcient scheduling policies that optimize various performance metrics
in heterogeneous wireless networks."
2,BC-MetaCast: A Blockchain-Enhanced Intelligent Computing Framework for Metaverse Livecast,"Abstract
Livecast in metaverse, such as Metaverse Con-
cert, is gaining momentum, however, its extreme-
ly compute-intensive and delay-sensitive features 
challenge the ability of current computing para-
digm. Besides, decentralization, which is one of 
the core ideas of the metaverse, drives the move 
away from cloud computing and edge computing. 
Hence, it urges a trustworthy, robust, and efficient 
intelligent computing paradigm to meet these 
requirements. In this article, we discuss the prob-
lems related to livecast in metaverse, and propose 
a blockchain-enhanced intelligent computing 
framework for metaverse livecast (BC-MetaCast). 
With smart contracts built upon a hybrid block-
chain with multiple regions, BC-MetaCast offers a 
decentralized and truthful framework. Besides, we 
design On&Off-Chain Superimposed DRL (Sup-
DRL) algorithm based on deep reinforcement 
learning in BC-MetaCast to achieve efficient com-
putational task. Finally, experimental results are 
provided to illustrate that BC-MetaCast is reliable, 
scalable, and can provide superior service quality 
compared to state-of-art schemes."
2,How to Disturb Network Reconnaissance: A Moving Target Defense Approach Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract— With the explosive growth of Internet traffic, large
sensitive and valuable information is at risk of cyber attacks,
which are mostly preceded by network reconnaissance. A moving
target defense technique called host address mutation (HAM)
helps facing network reconnaissance. However, there still exist
several fundamental problems in HAM: 1) current approaches
cannot be self-adaptive to adversarial strategies; 2) network state
is time-varying because each host decides whether to mutate
IP address; and 3) most methods mainly focus on enhancing
security, but ignore the survivability of existing connections.
In this paper, an Intelligence-Driven Host Address Mutation
(ID-HAM) scheme is proposed to address aforementioned chal-
lenges. We firstly model a Markov decision process (MDP) to
describe the mutation process, and design a seamless mutation
mechanism. Secondly, to remove infeasible actions from the
action space of MDP, we formulate address-to-host assignments
as a constrained satisfaction problem. Thirdly, we design an
advantage actor-critic algorithm for HAM, which aims to learn
from scanning behaviors. Finally, security analysis and extensive
simulations highlight the effectiveness of ID-HAM. Compared
with state-of-the-art solutions, ID-HAM can decrease maximum
25% times of scanning hits while only influencing communica-
tion slightly. We also implemented a proof-of-concept prototype
system to conduct experiments with multiple scanning tools."
2,Transcoding-Enabled Cloud&#x2013;Edge&#x2013;Terminal Collaborative Video Caching in Heterogeneous IoT Networks: An Online Learning Approach With Time-Varying Information,"Abstract—As a key enabling technology in intelligent heteroge-
neous Internet of Things (IoT), edge caching provides important
support for reducing core network load and improving network
service efﬁciency, especially for high bandwidth demand services
represented by multimedia applications. However, external time-
varying information is hard to be obtained comprehensively
in a complicated heterogeneous IoT environment. Meanwhile,
there exists the substitutability of content (e.g., videos with
different bitrates), which is difﬁcult to make caching deci-
sions online in real-time to achieve fast feedback with low
latency and avoid useless deployment. To this end, this arti-
cle designs a transcoding-enabled online cache scheme for IoT
video service with cloud–edge–terminal collaboration. First, we
design a variable bitrate video routing strategy to dynamically
retrieve content from cloud/edge according to user demands.
Furthermore, the video caching problem is considered as an
online convex optimization problem to learn utility gradient and
determine the optimal caching strategy in real-time without any
prior information. On this basis, we extend the problem to elas-
tic networks with dynamic available resources and prove the
sublinear regret and sublinear constraint violation. Finally, we

2,When Moving Target Defense Meets Attack Prediction in Digital Twins: A Convolutional and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Abstract— With rapid development of emerging technologies
for Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins (DT) have been
proposed to support a wide variety of applications. A mobile
network is expected to be integrated with DT to form a
DT mobile network (DTMN). Unfortunately, DTMN still faces
security threats, which have attracted great research attention.
Current defense mechanisms are mostly static, i.e., responding
after attacks happening. To solve the aforementioned problem,
moving target defense (MTD) has been proposed as an innovative
solution. However, there exist three major challenges when
applying MTD into DTMN. Firstly, less emphasis was paid to
collaborative scheduling between multiple MTD schemes, which
can improve the security of DTMN. Secondly, MTD schemes

In this paper, we propose a collaborative mutation-based MTD
(CM-MTD) in DTMN. We mainly consider two MTD schemes
called host address mutation (HAM) and route mutation (RM),
respectively, which adjust network properties and invalidate
different stages of cyber kill chain. We firstly formulate a
semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) to model time-varying
security events and dynamic deployment of multiple MTD
schemes. Then, security events are predicted by long short-term
memory (LSTM), which are regarded as network states in SMDP.
Next, infeasible actions that do not satisfy network constraints
will be removed from the action space of the SMDP. Lastly,
we design a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm
for collaborative scheduling. Simulation results highlight the
effectiveness of CM-MTD compared with baseline solutions."
3,A Lightweight Training-Free Method for Neural Architecture Search,"Abstract—The training-free score function was proposed in
recent studies because it can be used to cut down the computation
costs in evaluating a neural architecture compared to a complete
training process. However, although most training-free score
functions can dramatically accelerate the speed of a neural
architecture evaluation, a certain number of misjudgments for
neural architectures may still occur during the process of neural
architecture search (NAS). To address this problem, this paper
presents a new training-free score function and genetic algo-
rithm to evaluate a neural architecture for NAS, called genetic
algorithm for lightweight training-free neural architecture search
(GALTNAS). The training-free score function proposed here
will not only take into account the number of parameters and
convolution layers of a neural architecture, but it also takes less
computation costs than other training-free score functions. In
order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm,
we compare it with other state-of-the-art training-free and non-
training-free NAS algorithms. The experimental results show
that GALTNAS outperforms all the other NASs in terms of
the accuracy and computational cost for complex search spaces.
The results also show that GALTNAS can provide a 10%
improvement in accuracy compared to other non-weight-sharing,
weight-sharing, and training-free methods."
3,An Effective Algorithm Based on Space Net Optimization for Multi-Objective Optimization,"Abstract—How to keep the information of most, if not all, of
the searched solutions of a metaheuristic algorithm has been an
important research issue in recent years. The main reason is
because the information is very helpful in determining precisely
the search directions during the convergence process. Recently,
the space net optimization (SNO) was presented that attempts
to use the information from most of the searched solutions to
understand the solution (or objective) space landscape of the
single objective bound constrained problem. In this study, a
simpliﬁed version of SNO, called multi-objective simple space
net optimization (MOSSNO), is presented to solve the multi-
objective optimization problem. This algorithm adopts some
essential mechanisms and operators of SNO; namely, (1) elastic
points and space net to make it possible for a metaheuristic
algorithm to depict the landscape of the objective space of an
optimization problem and (2) expected values of different regions
in the objective space to guide searches during the convergence
process. Moreover, the proposed algorithm uses an external
archive mechanism to save the nondominated solutions so that
it is able to avoid searching the areas that have been searched
before repeatedly. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can provide better results than the other multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) evaluated in this study in
terms of the inverted generational distance (IGD) in most cases."
3,"Explainable AI (XAI) in Image Segmentation in Medicine,","Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has found numerous applications in computer vision. While image
classification-based explainability techniques have garnered significant attention, their counter-
parts in semantic segmentation have been relatively neglected. Given the prevalent use of image
segmentation, ranging from medical to industrial deployments, these techniques warrant a sys-
tematic look. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on XAI in semantic image
segmentation. This work focuses on techniques that were either specifically introduced for dense
prediction tasks or were extended for them by modifying existing methods in classification. We
analyze and categorize the literature based on application categories and domains, as well as the
evaluation metrics and datasets used. We also propose a taxonomy for interpretable semantic
segmentation, and discuss potential challenges and future research directions.
Key words: XAI, interpretable AI, interpretability, image segmentation, semantic segmentation."
3,Toward Blockchain for Intelligent Systems,"Abstract—The artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and blockchain (BC) are obviously two promising
research topics that will no doubt open up many business opportunities. Although there
exists essential difference between AI and BC, some recent studies have attempted to put
them into a single information system. Such integrations, of course, can be either AI for BC
or BC for AI based integrated systems. However, putting these two distinctive
technologies directly into a single system might not create integrating synergistic effects
because several AI technologies were originally designed for centralized computing
environment while BC technologies were designed for distributed computing
environment. This article begins with a brief review of AI and BC technologies. A
distributed AI framework based on BC technologies is then presented to provide an
integrated solution to combine these two critical technologies. Finally, several important
open issues and possible research directions of BC for intelligent systems will then be
given to depict the future of these two technologies.

3,Available online at www.sciencedirect.com,"Abstract
The goal of neural architecture search (NAS) is to either downsize the neural architecture and model of a deep neural network (DNN),
adjust a neural architecture to improve its end result, or even speed up the whole training process. Such improvements make it possible
to generate or install the model of a DNN on a small device, such as a device of internet of things or wireless sensor network. Because
most NAS algorithms are time-consuming, finding out a way to reduce their computation costs has now become a critical research issue.
The training-free method (also called the zero-shot learning) provides an alternative way to estimate how good a neural architecture is more
efficiently during the process of NAS by using a lightweight score function instead of a general training process to avoid incurring heavy
costs. This paper starts with a brief discussion of DNN and NAS, followed by a brief review of both model-dependent and model-independent
training-free score functions. A brief"
3,SEFSD: an effective deployment algorithm for fog computing systems,"Abstract 
Fog computing aims to mitigate data communication delay by deploying fog nodes to provide servers in the prox‑
imity of users and offload resource-hungry tasks that would otherwise be sent to distant cloud servers. In this paper, 
we propose an effective fog device deployment algorithm based on a new metaheuristic algorithm–search eco‑
nomics–to solve the optimization problem for the deployment of fog computing systems. The term “effective” in this 
paper refers to that the developed algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of metrics such as lower 
latency and less resource usage. Compared with conventional metaheuristic algorithms, the proposed algorithm 
is unique in that it first divides the solution space into a set of regions to increase search diversity of the search 
and then allocates different computational resources to each region according to its potential. To verify the effective‑
ness of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with several classical fog computing deployment algorithms. The 
simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides lower network latency and higher quality of service 
than the other deployment algorithms evaluated in this study."
3,A Hybrid Firefly with Dynamic Multi-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization for WSN Deployment   825,"Abstract
Enhancing the coverage area of the sensing range with the 
limiting resource is a critical problem in the wireless sensor 
network (WSN). Mobile sensors are patched coverage holes 
and they also have limited energy to move in large distances. 
Several recent studies indicated the metaheuristic algorithms 
can find an acceptable deployed solution in a reasonable 
time, especially the PSO-based algorithm. However, the 
speeds of convergence of most PSO-based algorithms are 
too fast which will lead to the premature problem to degrade 
the quality of deployed performance in WSN. A hybrid 
metaheuristic combined with dynamic multi-swarm particle 
swarm optimization and firefly algorithm will be presented 
in this paper to find an acceptable deployed solution with the 
maximum coverage rate and minimum energy consumption 
via static and mobile sensors. Moreover, a novel switch 
search mechanism between sub-swarms will also be 
presented for the proposed algorithm to avoid fall into 
local optimal in early convergence process. The simulation 
results show that the proposed method can obtain better 
solutions than other PSO-based deployment algorithms 
compared in this paper in terms of coverage rate and energy 
consumption."
3,Space Net Optimization,"Abstract
Most metaheuristic algorithms rely on a few searched solutions to guide later searches during the conver-
gence process for a simple reason: the limited computing resource of a computer makes it impossible to
retain all the searched solutions. This also reveals that each search of most metaheuristic algorithms is just
like a ballpark guess. To help address this issue, we present a novel metaheuristic algorithm called space
net optimization (SNO). It is equipped with a new mechanism called space net; thus, making it possible
for a metaheuristic algorithm to use most information provided by all searched solutions to depict the land-
scape of the solution space. With the space net, a metaheuristic algorithm is kind of like having a “vision”
on the solution space. Simulation results show that SNO outperforms all the other metaheuristic algorithms
compared in this study for a set of well-known single objective bound constrained problems in most cases."
3,A Training-Free Neural Architecture Search Algorithm Based on Search Economics,"Abstract—Motivated by the observation that most neural archi-
tecture search (NAS) methods are time consuming because a
“training process” is required to evaluate each searched neu-
ral architecture, this article presents an efﬁcient NAS algorithm
based on a promising metaheuristic algorithm named search
economics (SE) and a new training-free estimator to evaluate
the searched neural architectures for not only obtaining a good
neural architecture but also accelerating the computation time.
The basic idea of the proposed NAS algorithm is to use the
so-called expected value of each region in the search space to
guide the search so that it will focus on searching high poten-
tial regions instead of solutions with high objective values in
particular regions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm, we compare it with state-of-the-art nontraining-free
and training-free NAS methods. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithm is capable of ﬁnding a result that is sim-
ilar to or better than those found by most nontraining-free NAS
algorithms compared in this study but taking only a tiny portion
of the computation time."
3,An Effective Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Bike-Sharing System Demand Prediction,"Abstract—In this paper, we propose a NAS method called Simu-
lated Annealing-Genetic Algorithm one-shot Network (SAGAON)
that automatically generates a neural network for Bike-Sharing
System (BSS) demand prediction. A new search strategy, adaptive
simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA), is implemented
in NAS that accelerates the process of searching best architecture.
By combining with simulated annealing algorithm, ASAGA
improves the problems like premature convergence and lack
of hill-climbing capacity in traditional genetic algorithm. With
ASAGA, we not only reduce the NAS searching time but also
create a model on devices with limited computing resources. By
validating the proposed method in New York Citi Bike dataset,
experiment results show that searched model architecture is a
strong competitor compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
The proposed method also indicates its effectiveness on the
reduction of search time and computational resources."
3,An Effective Metaheuristic-based Pruning Method for Convolutional Neural Network,"ABSTRACT
Selecting filters to be pruned and determining the pruning ratio are
two important research issues of model compression because both
of them will strongly impact the accuracy, size, and computation
time of a neural network. In this study, an effective algorithm—based
on a promising metaheuristic algorithm, search economics, to find
the pruning ratio and the filter importance of each convolutional
layer to remove unimportant filters—is proposed. Experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm can find a better solution
than other pruning methods compared in this study.

3,Search Economics for Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows,"ABSTRACT
Developing an effective search algorithm to find out a good solu-
tion for the vehicle routing problem is an importance issue, for a
powerful search strategy can also be used to make a better decision
for complex problems in the real life. The multi-objective vehicle
routing problem with time windows (MOVRPTW) is a famous rout-
ing problem that aims at minimizing both the number of vehicles
and the traveling distance at the same time. This paper presents an
effective metaheuristic algorithm for solving MOVRPTW based on
a new search algorithm named search economics (SE) the key ideas
of which are twofold: (1) to portray the solution space and (2) to
figure out the regions in the solution space with higher potential to
find out good solutions—both based on the solutions that have been
searched so far. By building on these two distinguished features of
SE, the proposed algorithm is capable of avoiding trapping in a local
optimum during the early stage of the convergence process, thus
making it possible to find good results in solving complex optimiza-
tion problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
algorithm performs better than other well-known metaheuristic
algorithms in solving MOVRPTW."
3,An Effective Adaptive Stacking Ensemble Algorithm for Electricity Theft Detection,"ABSTRACT
Compared to traditional power grid systems, smart grid is capable
of precisely and instantly detecting the segments of power grid
breakdown, isolating the affected parts and segments, and rerouting
transmission paths to unaffected segments to further provide a sta-
ble electricity transmission and distribution environment. However,
electricity losses of smart grid systems could be caused by errors of
electric meter, failure transmission line, or even illegal behaviors.
To detect the criminal behaviors in a smart grid environment, an
adaptive ensemble algorithm is presented in this paper, which is
composed of long short-term memory, convolutional neuron net-
work, and hybrid multi-head attention convolutional network. The
genetic algorithm is also used to find out good hyperparameters
for the voting mechanism (also called meta-learner) to enhance its
accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
can find better results than traditional classification algorithms
for solving the electricity theft detection problem in terms of the
precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) and F1-score."
3,An Effective Neural Architecture Optimization Algorithm for CNN based on Search Economics,"ABSTRACT
Developing a good convolutional neural network (CNN) archi-
tecture manually by trial and error is typically extremely time-
consuming and requires a lot of effort. That is why several recent
studies have attempted to develop ways to automatically construct
a suitable CNN architecture. In this study, an effective neural ar-
chitecture search (NAS) algorithm based on a novel metaheuristic
algorithm, search economics (SE), is presented for CNN to improve
the accuracy of image classification. The basic idea of the proposed
algorithm is to use the “expected value” instead of the “objective
value” to evaluate a set of searched solutions, i.e., neural architec-
tures in this case. As such, the searches of the proposed algorithm
will trend to high potential regions in the solution space. Simula-
tion results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms genetic
algorithm-based NAS algorithm in terms of the accuracy, especially
for complex image classification problems."
3,A Deep Learning-Based Integrated Algorithm for Misbehavior Detection System in VANETs,"ABSTRACT
With the advance in the internet of things (IoT), wireless commu-
nication, and artificial intelligence, nowadays, people can enjoy
the autonomous driving system. Meanwhile, security issues found
in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have attracted the atten-
tion of researchers from different disciplines in recent years. Since
traditional rule-based algorithms are ineffective in detecting the
misbehavior in VANETs, developing an effective algorithm to deal
with this problem has become a promising research topic today. As
such, an integrated algorithm for misbehavior detection systems
(MDS) is presented in this paper. It is composed of convolutional
neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) mod-
els to reconstruct the location information as well as a support
vector machine (SVM) as a binary classification method to check
whether a vehicle is compromised or not. The vehicular reference
misbehavior (VeReMi) extension dataset is used to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm and all the other detection
algorithms compared in this paper. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting 95.37% of the com-
promised vehicles. In terms of the F1 score, the proposed algorithm
can provide better results than all the other detection algorithms
compared in this study."
3,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Two-Step Neighborhood Experience for Traffic Light Control,"ABSTRACT
Several recent studies pointed out that an effective traffic signal/-
light control strategy will be able to mitigate the traffic congestion
problem, and therefore variants of solutions have been presented
for solving this optimization problem. The multi-agent reinforce-
ment learning (MARL) is one of the promising methods because
it can provide good traffic control strategies for such complex en-
vironments. However, because each agent on its intersection of
most MARL-based algorithms has only partial information from
the observations of its intersection, the traffic control plan based
on such incomplete information of all agents may not always be
useful for improving traffic of an entire city. To enhance the perfor-
mance of the MARL in solving the traffic light control problem, we
present an effective algorithm based on an effective communication
protocol to share the information between agents of neighbor inter-
sections to make an integrated traffic light control plan. Moreover,
a two-step decision mechanism is presented in this study to further
improve the performance of MARL for traffic light control. To eval-
uate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compared it
with several message-passing-based algorithms on the simulator
of Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) in this study. The results
show that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding better results
than all the other message-passing-based algorithms compared in
this study for traffic light control problems."
3,A Training-free Genetic Neural Architecture Search,"ABSTRACT
The so-called neural architecture search (NAS) provides an alter-
native way to construct a “good neural architecture,” which would
normally outperform hand-made architectures, for solving complex
problems without domain knowledge. However, a critical issue for
most of the NAS techniques is in that it is computationally very
expensive because several complete/partial training processes are
involved in evaluating the goodness of a neural architecture dur-
ing the process of NAS. To mitigate this problem for evaluating a
single neural architecture found by the search algorithm of NAS,
we present an efﬁcient NAS in this study, called genetic algorithm
and noise immunity for neural architecture search without training
(GA-NINASWOT). The genetic algorithm (GA) in the proposed
algorithm is used to search for high potential neural architectures
while a modiﬁed scoring method based on the neural architecture
search without training (NASWOT) is used to replace the training
process of each neural architecture found by the GA for measuring its
quality. To evaluate the performance of GA-NINASWOT, we com-
pared it with several state-of-the-art NAS techniques, which include
weight-sharing methods, non-weight-sharing methods, and NAS-
WOT. Simulation results show that GA-NINASWOT outperforms
all the other state-of-the-art weight-sharing methods and NASWOT
compared in this study in terms of the accuracy and computational
time. Moreover, GA-NINASWOT gives a result that is comparable
to those found by the non-weight-sharing methods while reducing
99% of the search time."
3,An effective hybrid-heuristic algorithm for urban traffic light scheduling,"Abstract
The trafﬁc light cycle optimization problem (TLCOP) is certainly one of the most critical problems in a modern trafﬁc
management system because a ‘‘good solution’’ will be able to reduce the total waiting time of vehicles on roads of an
entire city. In addition to heuristic algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms provide an alternative way for solving this
optimization problem in the sense that they provide a better solution to adjust the trafﬁc lights to mitigate the trafﬁc
congestion problem. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement. One of the open issues is that most
metaheuristic algorithms will converge to a few regions at the later stage of the convergence process and thus are likely to
fall into local optima. The proposed algorithm—a hybrid heuristic algorithm called grey wolf with grasshopper opti-
mization (GWGO)—is developed to leverage the strength of grey wolf and grasshopper optimization algorithms. The
underlying idea is to use the grey wolf optimization to avoid falling into local optimum too quickly while using the
grasshopper optimization to dynamically adjust the convergence speed of the search algorithm. The experimental results
show that the proposed algorithm is able to ﬁnd out better results than all the other state-of-the-art search algorithms for the
TLCOP evaluated in this study in terms of the quality of the end results."
3,Available online at www.sciencedirect.com,"Abstract
The unlimited possibilities of machine learning have been shown in several successful reports and applications. However, how to make sure
that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network
environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based
systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development
of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine
learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination
of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters
of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue
of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain.

4,Improved affine projection algorithms with selective projection order for channel identification,"Abstract
One of the most signiﬁcant challenges in adaptive ﬁlters is the slow convergence speed of the adaptive algorithm when
dealing with highly correlated input signals. The adaptive afﬁne projection algorithm (APA) which is a generalized version
of the well-known normalized least mean square algorithm, improves convergence speed against correlated input signals, but
with a high steady-state weight error and considerable computational complexity. In this paper, to enhance the convergence
performance of APA and reduce its complexity, a selective projection order APA and its proportionate variant are proposed. In
these algorithms, the projection order varies during convergence. Initially, a high projection order is employed in adaptation,
gradually decreasing as the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the weight error decreases. This adaptive approach maintains
a high initial convergence speed while reducingss the steady-state error. Moreover, the computational complexity decreases
during convergence. Additionally, we propose a combination of proportionate and non-proportionate adaptive algorithms,
leveraging the variation of MSD during convergence. Simulation results in identiﬁcation of sparse/dispersive channels conﬁrm
the improved convergence performance of the proposed algorithms compared to competing adaptive algorithms."
4,Self UAV Localization Using Multiple Base Stations Based on TDoA Measurements,"Abstract—Localization of GPS-less UAV is fundamental for
path planning and navigation. In this letter, a TDoA-based ap-
proach for self-localizing UAV is proposed. The approach utilizes
multiple Base Stations (BSs) to obtain TDoA measurements
without requiring exact UAV-BS synchronization. A reformula-
tion of the measurements which relates the new transformed
measurements to UAV’s initial position is derived. A least squares
(LS) approach is proposed to solve the nonlinear equations.
Sufﬁcient condition of convexity of the LS cost function has
been proved mathematically and veriﬁed experimentally. Also,
a condition on step-size is derived to assure the convergence of
the algorithm. This leads to efﬁcient solutions for minimization.
Results show that the proposed method has outstanding perfor-
mance, especially, when compared to RSS-based UAV localization
method."

Image forensics encompasses a set of scientiﬁc tests to investigation of a suspected event via
intrinsic clues of imaging pipeline. Traditional image sensing at the Nyquist-Shannon rate
as well as the new modality of compressive imaging below the rate are two main types of
sensing in photography and imaging applications. Hence, for forensic investigators, it would
importantly necessitate the ability to discriminate among images captured by them. However,
due to the complex nonlinear nature of imaging processes, investigating imagers’ traces is
a difﬁcult task. To this intent, we ﬁrst systematically model the imaging pipelines as an
encoder-decoder pair. For exploring distinguishable traces, we mathematically simplify and
linearize the pair for compressive imaging and two main forms of traditional image sensing
with or without compression. Our theoretical analyses on the approximate linear models
reveal blurring kernels of different imagers have discriminability. To validate it in real-world
scenarios, we considered the whole imaging process as an inverse problem and estimated
the blurring kernel based on a deconvolution approach, where the discriminability is also
justiﬁed by information visualization. Then, we designed a pipeline classiﬁcation system,
where a deep convolutional neural network is trained by the estimated blurring kernels to be
able to classify the three imaging systems. Our results in compressive imaging identiﬁcation
show an accuracy improvement about 3.7 % in comparison to the best result among compared
methods. Implementation codes are available for research and development."
4,Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation via,"Abstract
In this paper, a private distributed estimation algorithm is proposed. In this algo-
rithm, a diﬀerential-privacy noise is added to the intermediate estimation to be
exchanged among nodes. Two types of diﬀerential noise is regarded in the paper
which are Gaussian and Laplacian. Also, in each case, two approaches are used to
recover the true intermediate estimations. In the ﬁrst approach, we estimate the
true intermediate estimation and in the second approach, we estimate the noise
vector and then subtract it from the noise intermediate estimation. We show that
both approaches lead to the same formula for denoised intermediate estimation.
Simulation experiments corroborate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithm
when variance of added privacy noise is high and the privacy is guaranteed with
high conﬁdence."

our approach yields a closed-form detection criterion. Theoretical

preserving distributed estimation algorithm, referred to as the
“Double-Private Algorithm,” which combines the principles of
both differential privacy (DP) and cryptography. The proposed
algorithm enhances privacy by introducing DP noise into the
intermediate estimations of neighboring nodes. Additionally, we
employ an inverse of a closed-form reproducible proportionate
gain matrix as the cryptographic key matrix to fortify the privacy
protection within the proposed double private algorithm. We im-
prove the algorithm by transmitting alternative variable vectors
instead of raw measurements, resulting in enhanced key matrix
reconstruction performance. This innovative approach mitigate
noise impact, enhancing overall algorithm effectiveness. We also
establish an upper bound for the norm of the error between the
non-private Diffusion Least Mean Square (DLMS) algorithm and
our double private algorithm. Further, we determine a sufﬁcient
condition for the step-size to ensure the mean convergence
of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, particularly its ability
to attain the ﬁnal Mean Square Deviation (MSD) comparable to
that of the non-private DLMS."

In this paper, an algorithm for estimation and compensation of second-order

second-order nonlinearity is derived. Third, a distributed algorithm is suggested
which consists of extra nonlinearity estimation and compensation units. More-
over, considering the second-order nonlinearity, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)
for estimating both the unknown vector and nonlinearity coeﬃcient vector is
calculated, in which the Fisher information matrix is obtained in a closed-form
formula. Simulation results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algo-
rithm in improving the performance of distributed estimation in the presence of
nonlinear sensors in a WSN."

4,IRS-Aided Received Signal Strength Localization Using a Wireless Sensor Network,"Abstract— In this letter, we initially present a formulation of
Received Signal Strengths (RSS) in a scenario involving one
source (or emitter), one Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), and
a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To determine the source
location based on RSS measurements, we carefully select IRS
phases to simplify the relationship between them. Subsequently,
we solve the resulting rather simple nonlinear equations using a
Least Squares (LS) approach. The solution involves an initial
estimation through a course search, followed by a Steepest-
Descent (SD) recursion. Simulation results highlight the superior
performance of SD compared to course search and some state-
of-the-art RSS localization techniques in the literature."
4,A Robust Stable Laplace Continuous Mixed Norm Adaptive Filter Algorithm,"Abstract—In this letter, a novel adaptive algorithm called Laplace continuous
mixed norm (LCMN) is introduced, which utilizes a new continuous
mixed p-norm (CMPN) technique. The CMPN algorithm incorporates
an exponential weighting function, which is shown to improve the stability
of the estimation process (i.e., CMPN shows less residual of error for a dc
voltage estimation) compared with CMPN with uniform weighting function
and other algorithms. The name “Laplace” is chosen for the LCMN algorithm
due to the similarities it shares with the Laplace transform, which are utilized
in the derivation of the algorithm. In addition, the mean convergence of
LCMN is proven, and a sufﬁcient condition for step-size value is determined to ensure mean convergence. Simulation
results in impulsive noise environments also support the higher stability of LCMN compared with other algorithms
(especially CMPN with uniform weight), albeit with a tradeoff of a slower convergence rate."
4,A Robust Proportionate Graph Recursive Least Squares Algorithm for Adaptive Graph Signal Recovery,"Abstract—In this brief, we propose a robust proportionate
Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm to address the problem
of adaptive graph signal recovery in the presence of impulsive
noise. In this problem, a graph signal should be recovered from
only a subset of sampled graph signal in an adaptive manner. To
this end, ﬁrst, the classical graph RLS algorithm in the literature
is written in a standard way, which is represented by an error
correction term. Second, the proportionate graph RLS is formu-
lated by adding a gain matrix in the recursion. Then, to calculate
the gain matrix, an optimization problem with non-negative
and scaling constraints is suggested. The active-set approach
is utilized to handle these constraints. To enhance robustness
against impulsive noise, we utilize optimized coefﬁcients derived
from the minimum disturbance principle. Moreover, an analytical
lower bound for the minimum disturbance and the computational
complexity analysis are given. Simulation results show the
advantages of the proposed proportionate-based RLS algorithm
over other approaches in terms of the rate of convergence in
presence of impulsive noise."
4,A Variable Step-Size Regularization-Based Quasi-Newton Adaptive Filter for System Identification,"ABSTRACT
The family of least mean square (LMS) based adaptive filtering algorithms suffers from
convergence performance limitation due to the sensitivity of such algorithms to the eigenvalue spread of the
input correlation matrix. The quasi-Newton family of adaptive filtering algorithms addresses this limitation,
but its performance is restricted by the estimation accuracy of the correlation matrix inverse, especially for
highly correlated input signals. Furthermore, the convergence rate and the steady-state performance of both
LMS and quasi-Newton families are thoroughly depending on their step-sizes. In this paper, a variable step-
size regularized quasi-Newton adaptive algorithm is proposed in the context of system identification. In this
algorithm, inspired by the matrix inversion lemma, a modified regularized matrix inverse with a time-varying
regularization is computed such that during the convergence, the contribution of matrix inverse in the weight
update is reduced, resulting in a more noise-robust algorithm. The paper further provides a convergence
analysis of the proposed quasi-Newton algorithm, wherein a variable step-size is proposed to achieve a high
initial convergence rate and a low steady-state error in the context of system identification applications."
4,A Robust Markovian Block Sparse Adaptive Algorithm With Its Convergence Analysis,"Abstract—In this brief, a robust Markovian adaptive ﬁlter
is proposed for block sparse system identiﬁcation problem. To
make Markovian adaptive ﬁlter robust against impulsive noise,
a Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) model is utilized
for the impulsive noise. Then, a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
adaptive estimator of the system impulse response is devised in
the presence of GGD impulsive noise. A moment-based parameter
estimation method is also presented for estimating the scale
parameter of GGD noise. Moreover, the convergence analysis of
the suggested robust Markovian algorithm is derived. Simulation
results show the effectiveness of the proposed robust algorithm
compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature,
especially from the computational complexity viewpoint.

4,Double-Proportionate Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Algorithm for Distributed Estimation,"Abstract—In this brief, we consider an uncertainty in the lin-
ear measurement model of the distributed estimation problem.
To deal with this uncertainty, the uncertainty vector is estimated
along with the unknown vector itself. Hence, the cost function
is assumed to be dependent on both unknown vector and uncer-
tainty vector and these two vectors are separately estimated
in an iterative manner. First, we update the unknown vector
assuming uncertainty vector is known and then, we update the
uncertainty vector assuming the unknown vector is given. Then,
to achieve lower error, we consider the double proportionate
scheme in the uncertainty-aware algorithm. Two diagonal gain
matrices are obtained mathematically with one degree of free-
dom, i.e., one gain matrix is obtained in closed-form assuming
the other gain matrix is known. Simulation results demonstrate
superior performance of the proposed algorithms as compared
to the classical diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm and
achieve near the performance of a case without uncertainty under
extreme noise conditions."
4,3-D Hybrid RSS-AoA Passive Source Localization With Unknown Path Loss Exponent,"Abstract—The use of received signal strength (RSS) measurements for passive localization is a simple and versatile
method in wireless sensor networks. Another commonly used method is based on angle of arrival (AoA) measurement.
Combining these two methods (RSS-AoA) can enhance the reliability of localization. In this letter, we investigate the
localization problem (using joint RSS and AoA measurements) when the path loss exponent (PLE) is unknown and
only some of the nodes are anchors with known locations. When PLE is unknown, localization performance is affected.
Therefore, we propose a joint estimation method for source location and PLE using an iterative weighted least square
estimation. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms other competing algorithms in terms of
localization accuracy."
4,Proportionate Adaptive Graph Signal Recovery,"Abstract—This paper generalizes the proportionate-type adap-
tive algorithm to the graph signal processing and proposes two
proportionate-type adaptive graph signal recovery algorithms. The
gain matrix of the proportionate algorithm leads to faster conver-
gence than least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. In this paper,
the gain matrix is obtained in a closed-form by minimizing the
gradient of the mean-square deviation (GMSD). The ﬁrst algo-
rithm is the proportionate-type graph LMS (Pt-GLMS) algorithm
which simply uses a gain matrix in the recursion process of the
LMS algorithm and accelerates the convergence of the Pt-GLMS
algorithm compared to the LMS algorithm. The second algorithm
is the proportionate-type graph extended LMS (Pt-GELMS) algo-
rithm, which uses the previous signal vectors alongside the signal of
the current iteration. The Pt-GELMS algorithm utilizes two gain
matrices to control the effect of the signal of the previous itera-
tions. The stability analyses of the algorithms are also provided.
Simulation results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the two proposed
proportionate-type LMS algorithms.

5,WaveCLR: Contrastive Learning of Guided Wave Representations for Composite Damage Identification,"Abstract— Damage identification in composite materials is an
area of interest within the field of structural health monitoring
(SHM). Damage identification in the field not only cares about
recognition accuracy but also requires robustness to the variation
of the input data. Deep learning methods to analyze guided
wave signals collected by ultrasonic testing (UT) for damage
identification have been gaining increasing attention in the last
decade. However, existing methods for damage identification lack
this robustness by failing to consider the input data distribution
discrepancy between the training phase (source domain) and the
inference phase (target domain). To address this issue, this article
proposes a novel domain generalization method named WaveCLR
for damage identification in composite materials using ultrasonic
guided waves (UGW). WaveCLR is a deep neural network (DNN)
model that leverages contrastive learning to account for data
discrepancies that typically arise from variations in ultrasonic
wave data due to damage characteristics. By maximizing the
feature mutual interclass distance and intraclass distance in the
source domain, the models’ performance in the target domain
is improved. The effectiveness of the proposed WaveCLR was
validated on two distinct datasets capturing different damage
scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed model success-
fully addresses the domain generalization problem in composite
damage identification."
5,Applications of Generative AI,"Abstract This chapter Abrahamaims to bridge the gap between the theoretical

chapter provides approaches and techniques for leveraging GAI to address research 
challenges and activities. It describes common research tasks and provides guidance 
on how to use GPT to solve them. To the best of our experience, at the current stage, 
the integration of researchers and GPT has the potential to yield better results than 
either could achieve alone. Furthermore, the increasing availability of GPT tools 
suggests that the synergy between the two will continue to improve research output 
quality and save time. The key to successful integration lies in the appropriate use of 
GPT that can be achieved by directing AI tools to solve tasks effectively and using 
prompt engineering techniques."
5,Automated Defect-Detection System for Water Pipelines Based on CCTV Inspection Videos of Autonomous Robotic Platforms,"Abstract—Water is an essential element for the survival
of human beings and a nation. Nowadays, water utilities
perform regular inspections of the internal conditions of
the pipelines via autonomous robotic platforms. The human
operator then analyzes the recording of the platforms to
identify the defects inside the water pipelines. This manual
assessment process is often time-consuming, exhaustive,
and error-prone. Hence, this article proposes an automated
defect-detection framework channel-spatial attention Mask-
Canny-regional convolutional neural network (CSA-MaskC-
RCNN) that automatically detects and classiﬁes defects. An
adaptive CSA mechanism algorithm is proposed to extract
the detected features more efﬁciently. The features are then
passed through a modiﬁed defect detector, MaskC-RCNN,
to classify the defects on the videos obtained through
the autonomous robotic platforms’ closed-circuit television
cameras. Then, the trained model is employed to develop a
defect-detection unit interface tool to perform the defect as-
sessment. The results from our study show that our model
can outperform the state-of-the-art model with a mean aver-
age precision of 86.89%. Hence, integrating this automatic
defect-detection system can save time and cost for the
human operator and aid them in making timely decisions
for pipe repair/rehabilitation.

sential for safe operation and cost-effective maintenance. Utilizing
the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique in nonlinear
ultrasonic testing (NUT), this study investigates the impact-
induced wave behavior across incremental impact energies (1J
to 19J), encompassing the emergence of barely visible impact
damage. Ultrasonic guided waves (UGW) from by piezoelec-

5,A Multidimensional Data Fusion Neural Network for Damage Localization Using Ultrasonic Guided Wave,"Abstract— Ultrasonic guided wave (UGW)-based damage local-
ization on plate-like composite structures plays a vital role in
the structural health monitoring (SHM) of aircraft structures.
Precisely locating the damage requires full utilization of high-
dimensional UGW signals as well as low-dimensional transducer
coordinates. However, current deep learning (DL)-based meth-
ods cannot incorporate transducer coordinates in the neural
networks. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel mul-
tidimensional data fusion neural network framework for damage
localization on plate-like composite structures using UGW. The
proposed framework includes an encoder and a Fourier feature
projection head to integrate high-dimensional wave signals and
low-dimensional coordinates. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is
adopted as a decoder to learn features from the encoder and the
projection head. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results with
less than 2 mm absolute distance error. Moreover, a discussion
regarding data availability in the training process is performed.
The proposed method demonstrates superior robustness over the
state-of-the-art methods with limited training data."

5,An Adaptive Approach for Ice Detection in Wind Turbine With Inductive Transfer Learning,"ABSTRACT
Ice-accretion on blades of a wind turbine will cause power degradation and threaten the
operating safety of the unit. The use of a machine learning method for ice detection is a promising solution.
However, it is costly and infeasible to establish a well-trained model for each individual unit. This paper
proposes an inductive transfer learning method to address this problem. The inductive transfer learning aims
to improve the detection performance by transferring knowledge from a well-established model. As there is a
distribution divergence between the source and target domain, most instance-transfer-based learning methods
realize the knowledge transfer by re-weighting the instance in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a
novel adaptive inductive transfer learning (adaptive ITL) method for wind turbine ice detection. The knowl-
edge transfer is achieved by offering a relatively stable prediction for the target task through the established
model trained in source task. Two auxiliary classiﬁers are then employed to correct the prediction error of
the previous prediction. The model in the source domain and two auxiliary classiﬁers are combined into a
whole model to make a further prediction for the target task. The experimental results on ice detection in wind
turbine demonstrate that the proposed adaptive ITL method can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the
basic instance-transfer-based model and is superior to the state-of-the-art inductive transfer learning methods."

synchronous averaging (TSA) method based on genetic algorithm 
in the implement of signal separation of planetary gearbox. The 
method of TSA with a full-range window is reviewed to 
demonstrate the cause of the distortion of the extracted signals. 
To eliminate the distortion, extracted signals need to be revised, a 
data-driven genetic algorithm is used to solve the correction 
coefficients. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 
two case studies of an analytical signal from simulation and a 
signal collected from a planetary gearbox test rig are performed. 
The results of the experiments prove that the extracted signals 
with correction are more accurate when the proposed method is 
applied."

7,Stretchable multimodal photonic sensor for wearable healthcare monitoring,"Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real-time monitoring
of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers are of profound significance for early
prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Integration of multiple modalities in a single
stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would be beneficial for more sophisticated
understanding of human physiology, but yet, has not been achieved. Here, we report a stretchable
multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain
deformations, temperature, and sweat pH in a single sensor architecture. The multimodal sensing
abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel-coated
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and
biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to
facilitate stimuli decoupling, and adopt a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and
accuracy. To achieve simplicity on sensor interrogation, spectrally-resolved multiband emissions are
generated upon the excitation of a single-wavelength laser based on upconversion luminescence (UCL)
and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. We show that the sensor allows for simultaneous and
sensitive detection of strain deformations, temperature, and pH levels in the physiological range with
fast responsiveness, robust repeatability, and reliability. Furthermore, we demonstrate proof-of-concept
applications of the sensor for simultaneously detecting artery pulse or cardiopulmonary activities, along
with skin temperature and sweat pH with negligible crosstalk, enabling a new paradigm of wearable
multiparameter monitoring in healthcare."

between the conductivity and the metallic rod will affect the
response signal. In this investigation, we have found that
the impedance phase at peak frequency is only related with
rod diameter, not conductivity. Meanwhile, the logarithm of
peak frequency is linear with the logarithm of rod diameter.
Specifically, the slopes of linear fitting are the same for
different materials, and the intercept is associated with conductivity. Hence, the diameter and conductivity can be
retrieved by the phase at peak frequency and the intercept of linear fitting. The related experiments have been conducted
on metallic rods with different materials and diameters, and the results indicate that the average error is less than"

Three lasers of different wavelengths were coupled to generate

the centerline of the fringes, followed by three optical path
difference distributions. An iterative correction method was
introduced to improve the accuracy of the optical path differ-
ence. The refractive index image was reconstructed by using
the inverse Abel transform, and the temperature image was
then retrieved. Numerical simulations were carried out for
performance evaluations. Reconstruction errors of optical path
difference and optical path distributions caused by the flame
were 0.0241 and 0.0293, respectively. Images of refractive index
and temperature were retrieved with errors of 0.0465 and 0.0935,
respectively. In experiments, interferometric temperatures for a
steady flame produced by a Bunsen burner agreed well with
the thermocouple readings. Dynamical flame extinguishment was
captured at a frame rate of 20k frames/s. Temporal variations
of average temperatures at different heights were visualized. The

important for the improvement of imaging quality for LAS 
tomography. An ergodic evaluation of fan-beam layouts was 
conducted in this work for beam optimization. The influences of 
the sensor shape, laser source number, detector number, and 
divergence angle on the imaging quality were studied by 
calculating normalized mean absolute errors of reconstructed 
images. Distributions of temperature and water vapor 
concentration of a flat flame from computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) simulation were reconstructed to determine candidate 
layouts for optimization. Distributions of a counterflow flame 
from CFD simulation and a bimodal distribution were used for 
synthetical evaluations of candidate layouts. The optimal beam 
layout was then determined in the balance of the imaging quality 
and system complexity. In the numerical verification, flat flame 
distributions contaminated by random noise were reconstructed 
respectively by the optimal layout and a pentagonal layout 
derived from the real sensor. Temperature and concentration 
errors of the optimal layout were respectively 57.4% and 53.7% 
smaller than those of the pentagonal layout at 40 dB, which

size, weight, and power, high ranging accuracy, and long 
measurement distance for detecting and tracking moving 
targets, such as satellite laser ranging, rendezvous and docking, 
and so on. A photon-statistics-based interacting multi-model 
(IMM) Kalman filtering method is proposed to detect a moving 
target and estimate the distance and velocity of the target. 
Photon statistics is used to make the photon ranging error more 
convergent to a Gaussian distribution, and to obtain light 
intensity information used to compensate for walk error. IMM 
Kalman filtering method is used to further improve the 
estimation accuracy of ranging, and to estimate the velocity of 
the target. Simulations and experiments were designed to verify 
the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method. In 
simulations, the initial distance and moving velocity of the target 
were set as 3000 m and 10 m/s. Simulation results show that the 
walking error compensation method can effectively improve the 
ranging accuracy, which is better than 0.05 m The mean 
absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 
the distance were reduced by 25% and 22% after the IMM 
Kalman filtering. The MAE of the estimated velocity of the 
target is reduced by 69%, and the RMSE of it is reduced by 47% 
using the IMM Kalman filtering. In the experiment, a single-
photon LiDAR was developed and the proposed method was 
used to detect a target performing reciprocating movements 
driven by a motorized translation stage. Experiments show that 
the method has excellent accuracy and robustness."

7,Two-Parameter Gauss-Newton Based Real- Time Ranging Method for Full-Waveform LiDAR,"Abstract—Real-time ranging can boost the imaging 
performance and speed for full-waveform light detection and 
ranging (FW-LiDAR). To enhance ranging accuracy and 
maximum ranging rate, a two-parameter Gauss-Newton (Two-
GN) based real-time ranging method is proposed for high-
accuracy real-time ranging with lower hardware resource 
consumption. The Two-GN reduces the coefficient matrix size 
from 3×3 to 2×2 for obtaining quick iteration step vector

7,A Phase Noise Immune TDLAS Flow Velocimetry via Using Modulated Waveform Synchronizing,"Abstract—A phase noise immune tunable diode laser 
absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) velocimetry method was 
proposed for gas flow velocity detection by using modulated 
waveform synchronizing. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer 
modulated the intensity of laser with wave number. The 
modulated laser was divided into a zero-velocity reference laser 
and a velocity measurement laser, denoted as beam 1 and beam 
2. Beam 1 passed through the zero-velocity gas, while beam 2 
passed through the flow. Due to the optical path differences of 
the two lasers and interference in the environment, phase noise 
exists between the two laser beams, and such phase noise distorts 
the readings of the flow velocities. To suppress phase noises, the 
peak and valley positions in these two modulated laser 
intensities were used to synchronize the lasers. Since the two 
laser beams were emitted from the same laser diode and 
modulated by the same interferometer, the modulated 
waveforms for both laser paths were the same. The 
synchronizing effectively suppressed the distortion from the 
phase noise. By extracting the absorption spectrum center 
positions in the two laser beams, the absorption spectrum 
frequency shift was obtained for a precise flow velocity. In this 
way, the proposed method achieved the suppression of phase 
noise in the flow velocimetry. Experiments verified that the flow 
velocimetry accuracy and the phase noise immunity of the 
proposed method was better than DAS."
7,Robust Temperature and Gas Concentration Imaging by LAS Tomography With Adaptive Basis Function Fitting and Artifact Removal,"Abstract— Laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) tomography
is an effective method for cross-sectional imaging of temperature
and gas concentration distributions in combustion diagnosis.
In this article, the adaptive basis function fitting and artifact
removal method is proposed to realize robust imaging in LAS
tomography. Modified Mexican hat functions are introduced as
basis functions to depict continuous distributions in the region
of interest (ROI). Adaptive basis function fitting is realized by
introducing a second reconstruction with core parameters of basis
functions, the scale factors, and center points, determined adap-
tively from the first reconstruction. After obtaining the integral
absorbance densities of two different spectral lines by adaptive
basis function fitting, the similarity between their ratio and one of
them is used to locate and remove the artifacts in reconstructed
temperature images. The proposed method yields less artifacts
and shows stronger noise immunity. The temperature image error
can decrease by 12% at high noise levels. Dynamic flames of a
McKenna burner were measured and temperature images with
less artifacts were achieved. In an acoustically excited Bunsen
burner, the proposed method precisely extracted the fundamental
frequency and acoustical excitation frequency and yielded a
higher structural similarity index. For a high-temperature wind
tunnel, the maximum relative error of temperature in the center
of the imaging region was 5.43% and the robustness of the
proposed method in practical applications was verified."
7,A multi-frequency magnetic particle spectroscopy system for systematic characterization and highly sensitive detection of magnetic nanoparticles,"Abstract
Systematic characterization and highly sensitive detection of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is
of great importance to investigate the magnetic properties of the MNPs for biomedical
applications. In this study, a multi-frequency magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) system is
developed to measure the magnetic response of the MNPs in different ac magnetic fields. A
model for the description of the output signal of the MPS system is deduced to analyze the
signal-to-noise ratio of the MNP harmonics. The noise source, including the Gaussian noise and
harmonic distortion from the excitation magnetic field, is quantitatively measured and
comprehensively analyzed to investigate their influences on the limit-of-detection (LOD) of the
MPS system. The MPS signal and dynamic magnetization curve of the MNPs are measured in
different ac magnetic fields with the developed MPS system. In addition, a series of MNP
samples with different iron concentrations are prepared for experiments to determine the LOD,
indicating an LOD of 2.3 ng in terms of iron. The dependence of the LOD on the Gaussian noise
and the harmonic distortion is discussed. The present work indicates that one needs to
comprehensively consider the influence factors of the Gaussian noise and harmonic distortion to
develop a sensitive MPS system with multi-frequency excitation.

7,"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, VOL. 73, 2024 7003108","Abstract— This article proposes a frequency-division multi-
plexing(FDM) laser dispersion spectroscopy (LDS) method to
implement high-precision water vapor temperature measurement
in a dynamic combustion environment. Two laser beams at
7185.6 and 7444.4 cm−1 pass through the flame simultane-
ously along a common path through the intensity-modulated
FDM approach. A pair of lock-in amplifiers (LIAs) are used
to demodulate the dispersion phase signals of the two laser
beams. Then, the two-line thermometry is used to obtain the
water vapor temperature in the flame. Static and dynamic
experiments were carried out on a McKenna burner and a
kerosene-fueled multiswirl staged combustor, respectively. The
in situ and time-resolved measurement results show that the
method is more immune to laser power fluctuation than direct
laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) and the measurement results
obtained by using the proposed method are more precise than
those by using the time division multiplexing (TDM) method.
Therefore, the proposed method is more suitable for dynamic
combustion monitoring."
7,Image Reconstruction for Magnetic Particle Imaging Based on Sparse Representation and Deep Learning,"Abstract— The
performance
of
the
image
reconstruction
method is crucial in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) as it helps
transform the raw signal data into a quantitative representation
of the nanoparticle distribution within the imaging area. In this
study, an image reconstruction method based on sparse represen-
tation and deep learning (SR-DL) is proposed to solve the inverse
problem of MPI and obtain high-quality MPI images. The sparse-
representation (SR) method we proposed earlier is used to obtain
the initial MPI image. Then the residual encoder-decoder convo-
lutional neural network (RED-CNN) structure is constructed to
enhance the initially reconstructed image. A fast dataset gener-
ation method is proposed by combining the simulated phantom,
measured system matrix, and measured noise data, which can
be easily ported to other MPI systems. Numerical simulations
are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method based on different loss functions. Furthermore, phantom
experiments are conducted using a custom-built narrowband MPI
scanner with a gradient of"

laser
absorption
spectroscopy
(LAS)
fused
electrical tomography (ET) is introduced to non-invasively mea-
sure the admittivity and temperature distributions of Bunsen
burner flames. All the operations are carried out at the same
region and height at multiple fuel-rich combustion states in
the same cross section. The closer the fuel-to-air ratio of the
combustion state is to one, the greater the values of admittivity
and temperature. Random forest (RF) regression method is used
to construct a mapping model for admittivity and combustion
state to temperature. The maximum absolute error and relative
error between mean temperatures of flame region estimated from
reconstructed admittivity distributions and constructed mapping
model with those measured by LAS are 60.45 K and 4.8%.
The proposed method is used to monitor dynamic acoustically
excited Bunsen burner flame, and the flame frequency measured
in the spectrums of admittivity and temperature matches the
measurements of a visible light photodetector. Experiments
demonstrate the ability of ET to monitor the combustion states
and temperature distribution of dynamic combustion fields."
7,Simultaneous Quantitative Imaging of Temperature and H&#x2082;O/CH&#x2082;O Concentration by Using LAS-Fused Nd-YAG Laser-Induced Fluorescence,"Abstract— A planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) using
the third harmonic of the neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum
garnet (Nd-YAG) laser at 355 nm is employed to visualize
temperature and H2O/CH2O concentration distributions inside
flames. Laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) is employed for
initial images of temperature and H2O concentration, and the
measured absorption offers constraints to update temperature
and H2O concentration images. A chemical reaction kinetics
model based on ethanol combustion mechanisms is established,
offering the production rate of H2O and CH2O, thereby bridging
PLIF and LAS. The images of temperature and CH2O/H2O
concentration are produced iteratively for quantitative imaging of
the flame cross-section. A flame fueled with ethanol vapor was
used, and the images of temperature, H2O concentration, and
CH2O concentration were given. Compared with thermocouples,
the temperature difference was found to be no more than 40 K.
The images of H2O and CH2O concentrations detailed the area
of incomplete combustion within the flame and its temporal
variations. Relative deviations from the experiment results to
the ideal values are, respectively, 3.05% and 5.34% for H2O and
CH2O."
7,A Traffic Sign Classification Method Using LiDAR Corrected Intensity and Geometric Feature,"Abstract—As
an
important
perception
sensor
for
autonomous vehicles (AVs), light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) provides 3D-spatial and 1D-intensity information.
To boost the ability of traffic sign classification (TSC)
using LiDAR, a novel classification method combining
corrected intensity and geometric feature was proposed
to
identify
traffic
sign
patterns.
An
unequal-interval-
division (UID)-based intensity frequency histogram (IFH)
was advanced to form high-quality input features, thus
facilitating the optimization of the backpropagation neutral
network (BPNN) classifier for better performance. A series
of experiments was conducted, including ablation study
and parametric investigations involving point density, sign patterns, and instrument types. Results showed that
the combination of geometric and corrected intensity (UID-IFH) feature enhanced the classification performance
significantly, with the indicator F1 score achieving 0.812–0.921 at the points density of 0.03–0.91 pt/cm2. Compared to
the state-of-the-art commercial in-vehicle LiDAR with unreliable intensity, the F1 score obtained from the high-stable
intensity LiDAR has an obvious improvement. The proposed method is expected to obtain better performance with the
advancements in LiDAR technology (e.g., high-density imaging in compact size and accurate intensity of low-cost laser),
to serve as an effective approach for decision-making in AVs."
8,Fine-grained Semantics-aware Representation Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval,"ABSTRACT
Text-based person retrieval aims to search for target persons based
on a given text description query. However, existing methods often
have the following problems: (1) Ignoring local attribute informa-
tion between different persons in feature learning, which results
in the low distinguishability of similar people’s feature representa-
tions. (2) Lacking fine-grained semantics alignment between visual
images and text descriptions, which leads to inconsistency in per-
son details between query and target. To address these issues, we
propose a Fine-grained Semantics-aware Representation Learning
(FSRL) method that establishing intra-modal local attribute corre-
lations and inter-modal fine-grained semantic correlations. Specif-
ically, we first design an identity self-distillation module, which
explores soft identity labels that reflect local attribute similarities
among different people. The soft identity labels assist the model
in learning discriminative features associated with fine-grained
attributes of persons. Secondly, we propose a visual-language re-
lationship modeling module that enforces the model to proofread
“error words” randomly changed in text during the cross-modal
interaction process to establish fine-grained image-text semantic
correlations. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves new state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets
and also performs well on the domain generalization task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/y416f/FSRL.

8,Domain Adaptive Pose Estimation Via Multi-level,"Abstract—Domain adaptive pose estimation aims to enable
deep models trained on source domain (synthesized) datasets pro-
duce similar results on the target domain (real-world) datasets.
The existing methods have made significant progress by conduct-
ing image-level or feature-level alignment. However, only aligning
at a single level is not sufficient to fully bridge the domain gap
and achieve excellent domain adaptive results. In this paper, we
propose a multi-level domain adaptation approach, which aligns
different domains at the image, feature, and pose levels. Specifi-
cally, we first utilize image style transfer to ensure that images
from the source and target domains have a similar distribution.
Subsequently, at the feature level, we employ adversarial training
to make the features from the source and target domains preserve
domain-invariant characteristics as much as possible. Finally, at
the pose level, a self-supervised approach is utilized to enable
the model to learn diverse knowledge, implicitly addressing the
domain gap. Experimental results demonstrate that significant
improvement can be achieved by the proposed multi-level align-
ment method in pose estimation, which outperforms previous
state-of-the-art in human pose by up to 2.4% and animal pose
estimation by up to 3.1% for dogs and"
8,A Comprehensive Framework for Occluded Human Pose Estimation,"ABSTRACT
Occlusion presents a significant challenge in human pose esti-
mation. The challenges posed by occlusion can be attributed
to the following factors: 1) Data: The collection and anno-
tation of occluded human pose samples are relatively chal-
lenging. 2) Feature: Occlusion can cause feature confusion
due to the high similarity between the target person and inter-
fering individuals. 3) Inference: Robust inference becomes
challenging due to the loss of complete body structural infor-
mation. The existing methods designed for occluded human
pose estimation usually focus on addressing only one of these
factors. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive frame-
work DAG (Data, Attention, Graph) to address the perfor-
mance degradation caused by occlusion. Specifically, we in-
troduce the mask joints with instance paste data augmentation
technique to simulate occlusion scenarios. Additionally, an
Adaptive Discriminative Attention Module (ADAM) is pro-
posed to effectively enhance the features of target individu-
als. Furthermore, we present the Feature-Guided Multi-Hop
GCN (FGMP-GCN) to fully explore the prior knowledge of
body structure and improve pose estimation results. Through
extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets
for occluded human pose estimation, we demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods. Code and
data will be publicly available."
8,SHaRPose: Sparse High-Resolution Representation for Human Pose Estimation,"Abstract
High-resolution representation is essential for achieving good
performance in human pose estimation models. To obtain
such features, existing works utilize high-resolution input im-
ages or fine-grained image tokens. However, this dense high-
resolution representation brings a significant computational
burden. In this paper, we address the following question:
“Only sparse human keypoint locations are detected for hu-
man pose estimation, is it really necessary to describe the
whole image in a dense, high-resolution manner?” Based on
dynamic transformer models, we propose a framework that
only uses Sparse High-resolution Representations for human
Pose estimation (SHaRPose). In detail, SHaRPose consists
of two stages. At the coarse stage, the relations between
image regions and keypoints are dynamically mined while
a coarse estimation is generated. Then, a quality predictor
is applied to decide whether the coarse estimation results
should be refined. At the fine stage, SHaRPose builds sparse
high-resolution representations only on the regions related
to the keypoints and provides refined high-precision human
pose estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the out-
standing performance of the proposed method. Specifically,
compared to the state-of-the-art method ViTPose, our model
SHaRPose-Base achieves 77.4 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO
validation set and 76.7 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev
set, and infers at a speed of"
8,Say No to the Poisonous Fungi: An Effective Strategy for Reducing 0-1 Cost in FungiCLEF2024 ,"Abstract
The FungiCLEF2024 competition endeavors to precisely identify fungi species leveraging both metadata and
image analysis. Pivotal to the success of this competition are two crucial evaluation metrics: minimizing the error
rate and the 0-1 cost loss resulting from misclassification. To reduce the identification error rate, we introduce a
Dynamic MLP framework, drawing inspiration from [1]. This approach effectively integrates image and metadata
embeddings through recursive blocks, utilizing matrix multiplication for deep fusion of information. To further
address the issue of 0-1 cost, we devise a novel probability-based screening strategy, which initially consolidates
poisonous fungi categories into a single class, then employs marginal expected loss and a threshold parameter
�to optimize the recall rate for poisonous species. These approaches significantly reduce the error rate and
0-1 cost associated with misclassification and achieve a score of 0.5548 on the private leaderboard, securing the
third-place ranking. The code is available at https://github.com/bftan1949/FungiCLEF2024."
8,"STUDENT, PROF, COLLABORATOR: BMVC AUTHOR GUIDELINES 1","Abstract
Open-world Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) has drawn significant attention re-
cently which assumes that the scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data for clas-
sifier training are sampled from different distributions. Existing methods typically as-
sume that all unlabeled examples are drawn from the same domain following the same
distribution. Nevertheless, this assumption may be violated as the unlabeled data are
often collected from multiple unknown domains practically. Therefore, this paper tries
to solve the OSSL problem under compound distribution shifts, in which the unlabeled
data are from multiple unknown domains which may deviate from the distribution of
labeled data. Specifically, we propose a novel Adversarial Mutual Information Disentan-
glement (AMID) framework to capture domain-invariant features for classifier training
without the knowledge of domains. Particularly, we find that the class tokens of the
pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) carry critical cues reflecting the styles of unlabeled
data which can be deployed to attribute unlabeled data into different discovered domains.
Subsequently, we train a feature encoder which captures the domain-invariant features
shared among the attributed domains via designed adversarial confusion loss, so that the
trained feature encoder can accurately represent the semantic information of unlabeled
examples regardless of their domains. To further enhance feature disentanglement and
enlarge the gap between useful domain-invariant features and interfered domain-specific
features, we minimize the mutual information between the outputs of the encoders cor-
responding to domain-invariant features and domain-specific features. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of our approach in resolving the issue of compound distribution shifts in
OSSL.

8,An Asymmetric Augmented Self-Supervised Learning Method for Unsupervised Fine-Grained Image Hashing,"Abstract
Unsupervised ﬁne-grained image hashing aims to learn
compact binary hash codes in unsupervised settings, address-
ing challenges posed by large-scale datasets and dependence
on supervision. In this paper, we ﬁrst identify a granularity
gap between generic and ﬁne-grained datasets for unsu-
pervised hashing methods, highlighting the inadequacy of
conventional self-supervised learning for ﬁne-grained vi-
sual objects. To bridge this gap, we propose the Asymmet-
ric Augmented Self-Supervised Learning (A2-SSL) method,
comprising three modules. The asymmetric augmented SSL
module employs suitable augmentation strategies for pos-
itive/negative views, preventing ﬁne-grained category con-
fusion inherent in conventional SSL. Part-oriented dense
contrastive learning utilizes the Fisher Vector framework
to capture and model ﬁne-grained object parts, enhancing
unsupervised representations through part-level dense con-
trastive learning. Self-consistent hash code learning intro-
duces a reconstruction task aligned with the self-consistency
principle, guiding the model to emphasize comprehensive
features, particularly ﬁne-grained patterns. Experimental
results on ﬁve benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior-
ity of A2-SSL over existing methods, afﬁrming its efﬁcacy in
unsupervised ﬁne-grained image hashing."
8,Dual-Perspective Fusion Network for Aspect-Based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Abstract—Aspect-based
multimodal
sentiment
analysis
(ABMSA) is an important sentiment analysis task that analyses
aspect-speciﬁc sentiment in data with different modalities (usually
multimodal data with text and images). Previous works usually
ignore the overall sentiment tendency when analyzing the
sentiment of each aspect term. However, the overall sentiment
tendency is highly correlated with aspect-speciﬁc sentiment. In
addition, existing methods neglect to explore and make full use of
the ﬁne-grained multimodal information closely related to aspect
terms. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-perspective
fusion network (DPFN) that considers both global and local
ﬁne-grained sentiment information in multimodal data. From the
global perspective, we use text-image caption pairs to obtain a
global representation containing information about the overall
sentiment tendencies. From the local ﬁne-grained perspective,
we construct two graph structures to explore the ﬁne-grained
information in texts and images. Finally, aspect-level sentiment
polarities can be obtained by analyzing the combination of global
and local ﬁne-grained sentiment information. Experimental results
on two multimodal Twitter datasets show that the proposed DPFN
model outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
8,Towards High Performance One-Stage Human Pose Estimation,"Abstract
Making top-down human pose estimation method present both
good performance and high efficiency is appealing. Mask RCNN
can largely improve the efficiency by conducting person detection
and pose estimation in a single framework, as the features provided
by the backbone are able to be shared by the two tasks. However,
the performance is not as good as traditional two-stage methods.
In this paper, we aim to largely advance the human pose estimation
results of Mask-RCNN and still keep the efficiency. Specifically,
we make improvements on the whole process of pose estimation,
which contains feature extraction and keypoint detection. The part
of feature extraction is ensured to get enough and valuable infor-
mation of pose. Then, we introduce a Global Context Module into
the keypoints detection branch to enlarge the receptive field, as it is
crucial to successful human pose estimation. On the COCO val2017
set, our model using the ResNet-50 backbone achieves an AP of 68.1,
which is 2.6 higher than Mask RCNN (AP of 65.5). Compared to
the classic two-stage top-down method SimpleBaseline, our model
largely narrows the performance gap (68.1 ����vs. 68.9 ����)
with a much faster inference speed (77 ms vs. 168 ms), demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at:

8,Hierarchical Semantic Structure Preserving Hashing for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Abstract—Cross-modal hashing has become a vital technique
in cross-modal retrieval due to its fast query speed and low
storage cost in recent years. Generally, most of the priors
supervised cross-modal hashing methods are ﬂat methods which
are designed for non-hierarchical labeled data. They treat
different categories independently and ignore the inter-category
correlations. In practical applications, many instances are labeled
with hierarchical categories. The hierarchical label structure
provides rich information among different categories. To rationally
take use of category correlations, hierarchical cross-modal hashing
is proposed. However, existing methods intend to preserve instance-
pairwise or class-pairwise similarities, which cannot fully explore
the semantic correlations among different categories and make the
learned hash codes less discriminative. In this paper, we propose
a deep cross-modal hashing method named hierarchical semantic
structure preserving hashing (HSSPH), which directly exploits the
label hierarchy information to learn discriminative hash codes.
Speciﬁcally, HSSPH learns a set of class-wise hash codes for each
layer.Byaugmentingclass-wisecodeswithlabels,itgenerateslayer-
wise prototype codes which reﬂect the semantic structure of each
layer. In order to enhance the discriminative ability of hash codes,
HSSPH supervises the hash codes learning with both labels and
semantic structures to preserve the hierarchical semantics. Besides,
efﬁcient optimization algorithms are developed to directly learn
the discrete hash codes for each instance and each class. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets show the superiority of
HSSPH over several state-of-the-art methods."
8,Estimating Human Pose Efficiently by Parallel Pyramid Networks,"Abstract—Good performance and high efﬁciency are both
critical for estimating human pose in practice. Recent state-of-
the-art methods have greatly boosted the pose detection accuracy
through deep convolutional neural networks, however, the strong
performance is typically achieved without high efﬁciency. In this
paper, we design a novel network architecture for human
pose estimation, which aims to strike a ﬁne balance between
speed and accuracy. Two essential tasks for successful pose
estimation, preserving spatial location and extracting semantic
information, are handled separately in the proposed architecture.
Semantic knowledge of joint type is obtained through deep and
wide sub-networks with low-resolution input, and high-resolution
features indicating joint location are processed by shallow and
narrow sub-networks. Because accurate semantic analysis mainly
asks for adequate depth and width of the network and precise
spatial information mostly requests preserving high-resolution
features, good results can be produced by fusing the outputs
of the sub-networks. Moreover, the computational cost can be
considerably reduced comparing with existing networks, since the
main part of the proposed network only deals with low-resolution
features. We refer to the architecture as “parallel pyramid” net-
work (PPNet), as features of different resolutions are processed
at different levels of the hierarchical model. The superiority
of our network is empirically demonstrated on two benchmark
datasets: the MPII Human Pose dataset and the COCO keypoint
detection dataset. PPNet outcompetes all recent methods by using

8,Graph-Based Motion Prediction for Abnormal Action Detection,"Abstract
Abnormal action detection is the most noteworthy part of anom-
aly detection, which tries to identify unusual human behaviors in
videos. Previous methods typically utilize future frame prediction
to detect frames deviating from the normal scenario. While this
strategy enjoys success in the accuracy of anomaly detection, criti-
cal information such as the cause and location of the abnormality is
unable to be acquired. This paper proposes human motion predic-
tion for abnormal action detection. We employ sequence of human
poses to represent human motion, and detect irregular behavior
by comparing the predicted pose with the actual pose detected in
the frame. Hence the proposed method is able to explain why the
action is regarded as irregularity and locate where the anomaly
happens. Moreover, pose sequence is robust to noise, complex back-
ground and small targets in videos. Since posture information is
non-Euclidean data, graph convolutional network is adopted for
future pose prediction, which not only leads to greater expressive
power but also stronger generalization capability.
Experiments are conducted both on the widely used anomaly
detection dataset ShanghaiTech and our newly proposed dataset
NJUST-Anomaly, which mainly contains irregular behaviors hap-
pened in the campus. Our dataset expands the existing datasets by
giving more abnormal actions attracting public attention in social
security, which happen in more complex scenes and dynamic back-
grounds. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the-state-of-the-art methods. The
source code and NJUST-Anomaly dataset will be made public at

8,Learning to Acquire the Quality of Human Pose Estimation,"Abstract—Making human poses serve high-level computer
vision tasks such as action recognition, recognizing the quality
of estimated poses is of critical importance. Conventionally,
the mean conﬁdence of each keypoint is used as pose quality
in most human pose estimation frameworks. However, because
different types of keypoint are not identical in visibility and
size, they should not contribute equally, which produces biased
quality scores. In the paper, we propose end-to-end human pose
quality learning, which adds a quality prediction block alongside
pose regression. The proposed block learns the object keypoint
similarity (OKS) between the estimated pose and its correspond-
ing ground truth by sharing the pose features with heatmap
regression. The predicted OKS correlates well with pose quality,
making the selection of reliable poses straightforward. Moreover,
utilizing the learned quality as pose score improves pose estima-
tion performance during COCO AP evaluation, because it ranks
more accurate ones high among all pose detections. We conduct
extensive experiments based on the three most popular human
pose estimation frameworks, including Hourglass, SimpleBaseline
and HRNet. Adding the proposed quality learning block is able
to consistently bring nearly 1 percent AP improvement on all the
frameworks.

8,Laplacian Welsch Regularization for Robust Semisupervised Learning,"Abstract—Semisupervised learning (SSL) has been widely used
in numerous practical applications where the labeled training
examples are inadequate while the unlabeled examples are abun-
dant. Due to the scarcity of labeled examples, the performances
of the existing SSL methods are often affected by the outliers
in the labeled data, leading to the imperfect trained classiﬁer.
To enhance the robustness of SSL methods to the outliers, this
article proposes a novel SSL algorithm called Laplacian Welsch
regularization (LapWR). Speciﬁcally, apart from the conventional
Laplacian regularizer, we also introduce a bounded, smooth, and
nonconvex Welsch loss which can suppress the adverse effect
brought by the labeled outliers. To handle the model noncon-
vexity caused by the Welsch loss, an iterative half-quadratic
(HQ) optimization algorithm is adopted in which each sub-
problem has an ideal closed-form solution. To handle the large
datasets, we further propose an accelerated model by utilizing
the Nyström method to reduce the computational complexity of
LapWR. Theoretically, the generalization bound of LapWR is
derived based on analyzing its Rademacher complexity, which

8,An Efficient Reinforcement Learning based Charging Data Delivery Scheme in VANET-Enhanced Smart Grid,"Abstract—Insufﬁcient and fragile delivery of enormous charg-
ing data imposes great challenges on the productive operations
of smart grid systems. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient
charging information transmission strategy (ECTS) for spatio-
temporal coordinated vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging services.
Speciﬁcally, based on the concepts of mobile edge computing
(MEC) and hybrid vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), an ef-
fective and scalable communication framework is ﬁrstly designed
to decrease communication costs. In addition, by means of the
derived model of wireless connectivity probability, an effective
reinforcement learning based routing algorithm is proposed to
adaptively select the optimal charging data delivery path in
dynamic large-scale VANET environments. Finally, a series of
simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness
and the feasibility of our proposed ECTS scheme."
9,"Intelligent Energy Management across Smart Grids Deploying 6G IoT, AI, and Blockchain in Sustainable Smart Cities","Abstract: In response to the growing need for enhanced energy management in smart grids in sus-
tainable smart cities, this study addresses the critical need for grid stability and efficient integration
of renewable energy sources, utilizing advanced technologies like 6G IoT, AI, and blockchain. By
deploying a suite of machine learning models like decision trees, XGBoost, support vector machines,
and optimally tuned artificial neural networks, grid load fluctuations are predicted, especially during
peak demand periods, to prevent overloads and ensure consistent power delivery. Additionally,
long short-term memory recurrent neural networks analyze weather data to forecast solar energy
production accurately, enabling better energy consumption planning. For microgrid management
within individual buildings or clusters, deep Q reinforcement learning dynamically manages and
optimizes photovoltaic energy usage, enhancing overall efficiency. The integration of a sophisticated
visualization dashboard provides real-time updates and facilitates strategic planning by making
complex data accessible. Lastly, the use of blockchain technology in verifying energy consumption
readings and transactions promotes transparency and trust, which is crucial for the broader adop-
tion of renewable resources. The combined approach not only stabilizes grid operations but also
fosters the reliability and sustainability of energy systems, supporting a more robust adoption of
renewable energies."
9,Development of Wireless Smart Sleeve Using Pressure Sensitive Resistor,"ABSTRACT Tactile pressure sensors have gained ever increasing attention in designing flexible electronics,
such as wearable devices. Building a pressure sensor characterized by high sensitivity and low implementa-
tion costs is a very critical challenge to satisfy. Recently, a new low-cost pressure sensor, namely Velostat,
has been proposed. Due to its properties of changing its resistance with either flexing or pressure, it has
become popular for making inexpensive sensors for microcontroller experiments. Here, we design a smart
sleeve made of Velostat to perform rudimentary controls on a smartphone. We first evaluate the optimum
layout of the sensor by conducting three tests on the sensor property, such as area of contact, Velostat area,
and layers of Velostat. Based on the test performance, a sensor patch is designed. Then, we develop a novel
resistive signal conditioning circuit to convert the pressure on the sensor patch into an electrical signal to be
transmitted to smartphones via Bluetooth. Finally, we have also realized an Android application that performs
the required operations (e.g., multimedia player controller and an SOS alert system) on the smartphone based
on the received sensor data. The functionality of our smart sleeve system is validated in real-time, showing
promising results for the design of low-cost smart wearables."
9,Extracting Fetal ECG Signals Through a Hybrid Technique Utilizing Two Wavelet-Based Denoising Algorithms,"ABSTRACT Developing an intelligent technique for fetal heartbeat detection to monitor the cardiac function
of the fetus in the initial stages of pregnancy is crucial. In this research work, two hybrid algorithms are
proposed that use a combination of recursive least square algorithm (RLS) and stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) for fetal ECG extraction. The goal of this research is to enhance the fetal ECG signal, reduce noise and
artifact, and accurately detect the R-peaks by employing improved spatially selective noise filtration (ISSNF)
method or threshold-based denoising approach in the wavelet domain. Accurate fetal R-peak detection can
provide important clinical information and aid in the diagnosis and treatment of fetal heart conditions. The
primary aim is to extract a clear fetal ECG signal from the mixed abdominal signal. The abdominal signal
is divided into multiscale components using SWT, with different levels of noise determining the scale of
wavelet decomposition. The RLS algorithm is then utilized for removing maternal ECG components, and
either ISSNF or threshold-based algorithms are employed for denoising in the wavelet domain. We evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and clinical data. Our analysis involves
qualitative and quantitative measures, including visual inspection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computation,
and QRS complex recognition. Our findings reveal that the proposed system exhibits superior performance
when compared to conventional adaptive filtering techniques. The experimental results suggest that the
proposed system has the potential to extract fetal ECG signals that are clear, with good SNR results and
minimal disturbances."
9,Development of CNN-LSTM combinational architecture for COVID-19 detection,"Abstract
The world has been under extreme pressure due to the spread of the coronavirus. The urgency to eradicate the virus has caused 
distress amongst civilians and medical agencies to an equal extent. Due to anomalies observed in the results from reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tests, more reliable options like computed tomography (CT) scan-based 
tests are being researched upon. In this paper, a novel combinational architecture is built upon the principles of Convolution 
Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to detect COVID-19 virus. This method uses 
chest X-ray images as inputs to combinational architecture for the classification of samples. The CNN part of the network 
will be used to extract features that help in the classification, and the LSTM part will be used for classification based on the 
extracted features. A total of 8 convolutional layers and 4 pooling layers are used for CNN and 4 LSTM layers of 64 and 
128 cells respectively. Instead of the sigmoid function, a rectified linear unit function is used as an activation function. This 
provides non-linearity to the CNN and better accuracies in comparison. The proposed model employs a padding layer to 
prevent the loss of information. Accuracy, loss, F1 score, and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are calculated to 
analyse the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The proposed model is validated using a relatively larger dataset of 
7292 images. The combinational architecture provides a more informative and truthful result in the evaluation of classifica-
tion as it caters to both the size of positive elements and negative elements in the dataset. The proposed CNN-LSTM model 
gives an accuracy of 98.91% and an MCC value of 97.84% respectively. The model is also compared with models employing 
transfer learning methods for similar applications."
9,A Graph Theory Based Self-Learning Honeypot to Detect Persistent Threats,"Abstract: Attacks on the cyber space is getting exponential in recent times. Illegal
penetrations and breaches are real threats to the individuals and organizations.
Conventional security systems are good enough to detect the known threats but
when it comes to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) they fails. These APTs
are targeted, more sophisticated and very persistent and incorporates lot of evasive
techniques to bypass the existing defenses. Hence, there is a need for an effective
defense system that can achieve a complete reliance of security. To address the
above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel honeypot system that tracks
the anonymous behavior of the APT threats. The key idea of honeypot leverages
the concepts of graph theory to detect such targeted attacks. The proposed honey-
pot is self-realizing, strategic assisted which withholds the APTs actionable tech-
niques and observes the behavior for analysis and modelling. The proposed
graph theory based self learning honeypot using the results γ(C(n,1)),γc (C(n,1)),
γsc (C(n,1)) outperforms traditional techniques by detecting APTs behavioral with
detection rate of 96%."
9,Hand hygiene monitoring and compliance system using convolution neural networks,"Abstract
Hand hygiene monitoring and compliance systems play a significant role in curbing the
spread of healthcare associated infections and the COVID-19 virus. In this paper, a model
has been developed using convolution neural networks (CNN) and computer vision to
detect an individual’s germ level, monitor their hand wash technique and create a
database containing all records. The proposed model ensures all individuals entering a
public place prevent the spread of healthcare associated infections (HCAI). In our model,
the individual’s identity is verified using two-factor authentication, followed by checking
the hand germ level. Furthermore, if required the model will request sanitizing/ hand
wash for completion of the process. During this time, the hand movements are checked to
ensure each hand wash step is completed according to World Health Organization
(WHO) guidelines. Upon completion of the process, a database with details of the
individual’s germ level is created. The advantage of our model is that it can be imple-
mented in every public place and it is easily integrable. The performance of each segment
of the model has been tested on real-time images an validated. The accuracy of the model
is 100% for personal identification, 96.87% for hand detection, 93.33% for germ
detection and 85.5% for the compliance system respectively."
9,Design of an Efficient Distracted Driver Detection System: Deep Learning Approaches,"ABSTRACT Distracted driving is any activity that deviates an individual’s attention from driving. Some
of these activities include talking to people in the vehicle, using hand-held devices such as mobile phones
or tablets, eating or drinking, and adjusting the stereo or navigation systems while driving. To counter the
effects caused by distracted driving, many countries around the world have imposed rules and charged ﬁnes
on distracted drivers in order to ensure safe driving. Owing to the technological advancement in recent times,
modern-day technologies such as computer vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques can
further support the efforts of governments to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. In this paper,
an efﬁcient distracted driver detection scheme (DDDS) has been proposed using two robust deep learning
architectures, mainly visual geometric groups (VGG-16) and residual networks (ResNet-50). The proposed
DDDS scheme contains the pre-processing module, image augmentation techniques, and two classiﬁcation
modules based on deep learning architectures. Both the architectures are implemented, and the results have
been compared in terms of performance indices, namely accuracy, and logarithmic loss. The two-dimensional
(2D) dashboard images derived from the State-Farm dataset are pre-processed and are used for training,
testing, and validation of the proposed architectures. Accuracy of 86.1% and 87.92% are achieved with
VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models, respectively, and it is observed that the DDDS scheme is found highly
efﬁcient for c4, c5, and c7 categories of the State-Farm dataset. The results obtained with the proposed DDDS
methodology are compared with existing literature and found to be satisfactory. The algorithms developed
and discussed for the proposed DDDS can be instrumental in reducing the fatalities and injuries caused due
to distracted driving."
9,Qualitative and Quantitative Detection of Food Adulteration Using a Smart E-Nose,"Abstract: Food adulteration is the most serious problem found in the food industry as it harms
people’s healths and undermines their beliefs. The present study is focused on designing and
developing a smart electronic nose (SE-Nose) for the qualitative and quantitative fast-track detection
of food adulteration. The SE-Nose methodology is comprised of a dataset, sample slicing window
protocol, normalization, pattern recognition, and output blocks. The dataset pork adulteration in beef
is used to validate the SE-Nose methodology. The sample slicing window protocol extracts the early
part of the signal. The sample slicing window protocol and pattern recognition models (classiﬁcation
and regression models) together achieved the high-performance and fast-track detection of pork
adulteration in beef. With classiﬁcation models, the qualitative analysis of adulteration is measured,
and with regression models, the quantitative analysis of adulteration is measured. An accuracy
of 99.996% and an RMSE of 0.02864 were achieved with the SVM classiﬁcation and regression
model. The recognition time in detecting pork adulteration in beef with SVM models is 40 s. With
the proposed SE-Nose methodology, the recognition time is reduced by one-third. To validate the
classiﬁcation and regression models, a 10-fold cross-validation method was used."
9,Development of an Integrated Soft E-Nose for Food Quality Assessment,"Abstract—Food is one of the basic essential elements for
human beings. Its quality is directly related to our physical,
emotional, and social well-being. An electronic nose is a
non-destructive instrument and is an effective solution for
quick and easy determination of food quality. In this paper,
an integrated soft E-nose methodology focusing on perfor-
mance enhancement and complexity reduction is proposed
and implemented for the effective classiﬁcationof beef quality
and prediction of microbial populationin beef. The soft E-nose
methodology is tested on 18 available datasets. Ours is a
four-step approach that includes validated data collection,
signal processing with a moving average ﬁlter and principal
component analysis for feature reduction, efﬁcient pattern recognition using machine learning and deep learning
techniques like support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, artiﬁcial neural network, extreme learning machine, and
deep neural network for classiﬁcationand regression, and an output stage for classiﬁcationand prediction of the microbial
population of beef. This methodology could provide accuracy greater than 98% using k-nearest neighbors, artiﬁcial neural
network methods, and a correlation coefﬁcient of greater than 0.98 using support vector machine and artiﬁcial neural
network methods. The proposed methodology is validated using 10-fold cross-validation."
9,A Quantitative and Qualitative Research on Fetal ECG extraction using Wavelet based Adaptive Filtering,"Abstract— Fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) extraction 
contributes a crucial part in monitoring the cardiac electrical 
activity of fetal heart. In this context, we propose a hybrid 
technique for fetal ECG extraction using recursive least square 
(RLS) based adaptive filtering algorithm and stationary wavelet 
transform (SWT). The accuracy of fetal beat detection is 
enhanced using improved spatially selective noise filtration 
(ISSNF) algorithm. The algorithm is designed for extracting the 
fetal ECG signal deriving out of the mother’s composite 
abdominal ECG signal and doctors can diagnose the health 
conditions of fetal heart during pregnancy period. The 
abdominal 
signal 
is 
decomposed 
into 
multiresolution 
components using SWT. The scale of wavelet decomposition 
depends on different values of noise level.  Fetal ECG extraction 
is performed using RLS algorithm. For denoising, ISSNF 
algorithm is used in wavelet domain. The proposed algorithm is 
experimentally evaluated using both synthetic dataset and 
clinical dataset. The performances of the proposed method are 
analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively by observation, 
signal to noise ratio (SNR) calculation and R-peak detection. 
The results indicate superior performance when compared with 
the traditional methods of adaptive filtering. Hence the 
proposed system is well suited to fetal ECG extraction for 
generating clean fetal ECG signal with high SNRs and low 
distortions."
9,Driver Sleep Detection:A New and Accurate Approach,"Abstract—Drowsiness in car or truck drivers has been a 
major cause of road accidents and it is inevitable that we 
determine the drowsiness of the driver in advance and take 
preventive actions. Three key physiological factors that act as 
indicators of drowsiness in a driver are closing of eyes, yawning 
and heart rate falling between 40 and 60 beats per minute. In 
this paper, image processing and machine learning based 
driver sleep detection (DSD) system is proposed. It mainly 
involves detection of closed eyes, yawning and monitoring of 
heart rate. The information of DSD system is stored in a cloud 
platform and can be accessed and utilized anytime for analysis 
purposes."
9,Wine Quality Assessment using Electronic Nose,"Abstract—The measurement of alcohol quality plays a key role
in the alcohol industry. The traditional methods to evaluate the
quality of alcohol, requires special training, costly equipment,
and time-consuming procedure. An electronic nose (E-nose)
with the integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms can
be a reliable solution for fast and easy evaluation of alcohol
quality. In this paper, design and functional aspects of E-nose
architecture in alcohol industries are discussed with emphasis
on the type of sensing technologies and decision-making systems.
An intelligent E-nose for assessing alcohol quality is introduced
in this paper. The ML algorithms, artiﬁcial neural network
(ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine
(SVM) are implemented on wine spoilage threshold dataset.
The performance of intelligent E-nose is validated by extensive
simulations. The simulation results conﬁrm better performance
with ML algorithms."
9,Webology (ISSN: 1735 -188X)  ,"Abstract-- In contrast to various sectors involved in producing, distributing, and transmitting electricity, 
there has been a noticeable increase in competition in recent times. This rise in competition has resulted in 
challenges when it comes to maintaining the safety, security, reliability, and dependability of the electrical 
system. To ensure a high level of safety and quality, the system operator is generally held responsible, 
particularly when considering ancillary services in a market that has been liberalized. The integration of 
competition has made the electricity market more complex, necessitating the separation of ancillary services 
(or the liberalized market) from generation services. These services should be subject to penalties and 
compensation within the market process. To maintain a stable and reliable voltage profile throughout the 
electrical system, the system operator adjusts and manages the active power to regulate frequency and 
reactive power. The system operator defines, procures, and implements such services.  
In this discussion, we will analyze the comparison between emerging economies and developed economies 
regarding various techno-economic aspects of ancillary services."

9,ProTecht &#x2013; Implementation of an IoT based 3 &#x2013;Way Women Safety Device,"Abstract— In this paper, an IoT based women safety 
device is proposed and implemented for effective self-
alert and protection. The proposed device is a three-way 
safety module for it provides self-defense, evidence 
recording and tracking information. Due to increase in

9,Implementation of an Automated Environmental Signal Conditioning Circuit in Automobiles,"Abstract—Now days, the world is improving in utilizing 
technology especially in automation and everything is running 
with automation. The role of automation in the field of 
automobiles is increasing day by day. In this paper, an 
automated system for the window glass is proposed to close and 
open based on the amount of the air concentration and purity 
inside and outside the car. When the interior of the car has high  
amount of CO2 level along with suspended particulate matter 
(SPM) 
and 
Chlorofluorocarbon’s 
(CFC) 
which 
causes 
suffocation, a trigger is given to the motor which is placed in the 
door window and the window will come down to let the fresh air 
come in. There will be an external sensor which is located on the 
posterior side of the car, so on reaching a polluted area it will be 
the first sensor to send a trigger signal to the controller. The 
controller will trigger the motor which will close the window. 
Another sensor is fixed in the windshield which on detecting the 
rainfall creates an alert signal to the controller to close all the 
side windows. Thus, the proposed methodology is basically the 
integration of rain sensor and chemical sensors working for 
maintaining human health and comfort automatically to reduce 
efforts of human and also avoid the risks of accidents in 
automobiles."

10,Recognition and Recommendation of,"Abstract. Current solutions to recommend available parking spaces
rely on options like: intentional user feedback; installing data collectors
in volunteering ﬂeet vehicles, or; installing static sensors to monitor avail-
able parking spaces. In this paper we propose a solution based application
that runs on commodity smartphones and makes use of the advanced sen-
sor capabilities in these devices, along with methods of statistical anal-
ysis of the collected sensor data to provide useful recommendations. We
exploit a combination of k-medoid clustering and Conditional Random
Fields to reliably detect a user parking with a limited sensor capabil-
ity. Next, we outline a method based on Markov Chains to calculate
the probability of ﬁnding a parking space near a given location. We also
enhance the solution with more sensor capability to discover desirable
properties in parking spaces.

10,SAE TECHNICAL,"ABSTRACT
The Brazilian automotive market is growing, vehicle sales 
ranked in the 4th. global position only behind China, United 
States and Japan; more than 40% of Brazilian production are 
entry level vehicles. 
The use of air conditioning systems in those basic vehicles are 
increasing due to being also considered as a safety device, 
besides its original thermal comfort function. 
Since 2008 a partnership between Inmetro, CONPET and 
Petrobras established the adoption of an “energy seal” ranking 
of vehicles in respect to their fuel consumption; the newly 
introduced tax regime: Inovar-Auto establishes less taxation to 
more efficient vehicles.  
This and other environmental concerns are demanding the 
reduction of CO2 emissions. Due to cost restrictions, the A/C 
systems installed in those vehicles, in most of the cases, are 
too simple and inefficient. 
In order to reduce fuel consumption electronic controlled A/C 
systems where developed but its cost is higher than the simple 
systems because their construction are more complex and they 
use a separated A/C control module along with many sensors 
and actuators.
In this paper we describe the concept of a simplified electronic 
A/C system, with fewer changes to the compressor, and some 
parts delete, that is controlled by the existing Engine Control 
Module via a minimalist interface and control panel, obviating 
the need of a dedicated A/C control module."

The use of static vehicle simulators, as a mean of testing and 
validating the software, is labor intensive, time consuming and 
error prone. So, the fast pace of the automotive industry pose 
as a high burden on ECM Software validation and testing due 
to: 1) increasingly shorter development cycles; 2) rising 
number of automotive players and; 3) stiffing of the 
competition, which calls for diminishing  engineering costs.  
The use of dynamic simulator with automatic test routines 
helps to approach these issues. Nevertheless, their high cost 
hinders its widespread use.  
This paper will describe a virtual vehicle simulator technique 
that can potentially expedite and greatly lower the cost of a 
considering part of the Software testing problem.  
As an abstraction model, this virtual simulator can be viewed 
as if it was a real, hardware based, dynamic simulator, 
allowing the communized test scripts and programmatic tools 
and interfaces."

As the complexity and size of algorithms dedicated to
EMS continually grows more hardware resources, like
processing  speed  and  memory,  are  demanded,
increasing the cost of the final product (ECUs in this
case). This paper presents a technique aimed at saving
flash  memory  space  by  pulling  pieces  of  executable
binary code out of the microprocessor’s flash area and
storing  than in an external  device  like  an EEPROM.
When the application needs to execute that piece of
code stored at EEPROM, it will request that piece of
code to be downloaded into an available RAM memory
area and run it from there. For such it is required that
some sort of allocation technique must be applied once
the RAM’ size is by far much smaller than the EEPROM
storage device’s size meaning that the whole content of
EEPROM can not be downloaded in a single shot into
RAM.  The  necessary  strategy  to  break  the  flash
application  code  in  smaller  pieces  to  be  put  into
EEPROM is also subject of analysis.  The technique is
made up by 4 steps:

A heated fuel injector includes a heated body, liquid fuel 
flowing through a fuel passage within the body, and a member 
that increases heat transfer from the heated body to the fuel 
within the fuel passage. The thermal efficiency of the fuel 
injectoris increased separately or in combination by diverting 
the fuel flow along an inner circumferential contour of the 
heated body, by limiting the volume of fuel bypassing the 
heated inner surface of the body, by redirecting heat from the 
body to unheated portions of the fuel flow field within the fuel 
passage, and by increasing the available contact surface area 
for heat transfer. Improved heat transfer from the heated body 
to the fuel is achieved by integrating features that increase the 
contact surface area into the inside surface of the body or by 
positioning an insulating or a thermally conductive spacer 
within the fuel passage.

Nowadays more than a million and half motorcycles are produced every year. In the metropolitan areas, the 
amount of pollutant gases emitted by the small motorcycles, begin to be significant. For this reason, the 
Brazilian government established emissions laws for motorcycles to be effective since 2003. Historically, the 
cost of ethanol fuel is almost half of the gasoline and therefore is the fuel of choice of the majority of drivers. 
Moreover the use of ethanol is far better than gasoline in terms of emission of green house effect gases. In 2009, 
flex-fuel motorcycles begin to be sold to the public. As they lack a proper cold start system, when using only 
hydrous ethanol fuel (E100) and the ambient temperature is lower than 15 degrees Celsius, the motorcycle is 
difficult to start and does not have a good drivability. As mitigation action, the maker’s advice is to fill the tank 
with at least 20% gasoline. This poses an inconvenience to the driver and avoids the optimal fuel cost. In order 
to solve this, a heated injector cold start system is proposed to flex-fuel motorcycles. The heated injector is 
provided with a heater at its tip, which is used to heat the fuel before the engine is cranked and for some time 
while the intake valve reaches its operational temperature. On top of that, using heated fuel might reduce the 
emission of HC and CO; minimizing the cost of exhaust gas after-treatment. It is also important to reduce 
emissions of unburned ethanol to the atmosphere to minimize generation of troposphere ozone, which is a 
harmful gas to health. This paper will present this cold start system in detail, showing comparison data of 
engine performance, drivability and emissions."

In Brazil the market for small motorcycles had 
steadily increased during the last decade. Nowadays about 2 
million units are produced every year. Market forecasts 
show that this trend will remain for many years.  
The amount of pollutant gases emitted by the small 
motorcycles fleet, begin to be significant. For this reason, 
the government established emissions laws for motorcycles 
to be effective since 2003.  
This law will become stricter over the years up to the

With this system, a motorcycle could run with any

10,GASOLINE C MADE WITH HYDROUS ETHANOL ,"ABSTRACT 
 
The consumption of ethanol fuel is increasing due to the higher costs of petrol and the increased 
participation of flex-fuel vehicles in the Brazilian passenger vehicle fleet.  
 
This paper presents some literature information, that Hydrous Ethanol (AEHC, or E100) can be used to 
make Gasoline C (E22) without water phase separation under typical Brazilian climate.  
 
This might present important improvement in ethanol production energy efficiency, less emission of 
Green House Gases (GHG), extra electrical energy to sell during the production periods and lower capital 
investments for the building of new plants.  
 
In Brazil two types of ethanol are used as automotive fuel: AEAC “Anhydrous Ethanol Fuel” with a 
maximum water content of 0.4% in volume; and AEHC “hydrous Ethanol Fuel” (E100) with a maximum 
water content of 4.9% in volume. The AEAC is mixed with about 22% in volume with Gasoline A (E0), 
to make Gasoline C (E22).  
 
The actual AEAC content in gasoline C is determined by legislation. Hydrous ethanol is produced by 
distillation of the fermented sugar-cane juice, up to a certain point, called the azeotropic point (about 
95.6%), when water and alcohol can no longer be separated by fractional distillation.  
 
In order to produce AEAC about the same amount of energy used by the distillation is used by additional 
processes, the later equipment being of the Molecular Sieve type."

Research involving the use of natural gas in internal 
combustion engines has been intensified due to 
concerns with the environment and exhaustion of fossil 
fuels reserves. In Brazil the abundance of natural gas, 
together with the need to reduce green house gases 
emissions and noise of urban buses, presented the 
opportunity to develop a Diesel-CNG control for Diesel 
engines using a mechanical diesel pump. An add-on 
system was developed using a production Engine 
Control Module. In this system, compressed natural gas 
(CNG) is added into the intake air stream and a pilot 
injection of diesel fuel is used to achieve ignition. One 
advantage of the Diesel-CNG system over a diesel 
engine converted to CNG usage using spark ignition is 
that the engine can operate in a diesel only mode; not 
reducing the resale price of the vehicle to regions less 
served with CNG fueling stations. Pilot diesel fuel 
injection provides a reliable mode of ignition for lean 
mixtures of CNG, compared to conventional spark 
ignition. This paper will describe the Diesel-CNG system

Ethanol has been used in Brazil as a passenger vehicle 
fuel since 1979.  Until the year 2000, vehicles were made 
to run exclusively with either gasoline or ethanol. The 
MultiFuel engine control module (ECM) was developed 
allowing vehicles to use fuels with any ethanol 
percentage, relying only on the existing oxygen sensor 
as opposed to an add-on ethanol sensor for the percent 
ethanol evaluation. The use of tank fuel level information 
allowed for  far more robust ethanol percent detection 
and improved driveability. Four years later, compressed 
natural gas (CNG) capability was integrated into the 
MultiFuel technology. Prior to that,  vehicles using CNG 
normally required a second ECM; however, the 
performance wasn’t always optimal. The MultiFuel 
integrated with CNG capability is known as the Tri-Fuel 
system.  It uses only one ECM, seamlessly controlling 
both liquid (ethanol blends and gasoline) and CNG fuels 
with little power loss, and excellent driveability and fuel 
consumption.  This paper will present both the 
MultiFuel and Tri-Fuel technologies."
11,Effect of laser polarization on atomic and ionic emissions in Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS),"Abstract
Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is attracting a great deal of interest in qualitative and quantitative analysis 
of materials. Close observation reveals that developments in the science that underpins LIBS as an analytical technique are 
limited to either signal enhancement strategies or newer data analysis techniques that facilitate better interpretation of raw 
LIBS data. Developments related to the excitation part of LIBS have been restricted to the effects of laser beam characteristics 
or the effect of ambient experimental conditions. The influence, if any, of the polarization state of the excitation laser has 
largely remained unexplored. We address this lacuna by probing the influence of different polarization states of the excitation 
laser on LIBS spectra of metals (copper and silver) and non-metals (polyethylene) by analyzing the polarization-dependent 
behavior of both atomic and ionic emission lines. Our observations open the possibility of tackling the problem of relatively 
faint emissions from ionic species in the plasma by appropriately manipulating the polarization state of the incident laser 
beam; this may lead to easy-to-implement improvement in the performance of LIBS instruments.

We measured transient reflectivity of single-crystalline and polycrystalline gold thin films in the wavelength region of 450–700 nm pumped
by a 400 nm femtosecond pulse. The observed reflectivity changes were reproduced well by a reflectivity model that we developed based on
the joint-density-of-states calculated from the band structure of gold and the Drude model. By a combination use of the reflectivity model
and the two-temperature model, we evaluated the temporal evolution of the electron and phonon temperatures from the observed reflectivity
changes. Based on the resultant electron and phonon temperatures, we derived the electron–phonon coupling factors, which were consistent
with the literature values, in the wide range of the absorbed energy density.

11,White-Light Spectral Interferometry for Characterizing Inhomogeneity in Solutions and Nanocolloids,"ABSTRACT: We demonstrate the use of white-light spectral interferometry as an
effective technique involving only linear optical interactions and a partially
coherent light source to measure the complex transmission response function of
optical resonance and to determine the corresponding variation in the refractive
index relative to a reference. We also discuss experimental arrangements to
increase the accuracy and sensitivity of the technique. The superiority of the
technique over single-beam absorption measurements is demonstrated by the
accurate determination of the response function of the chlorophyll-a solution. The
technique is then applied to chlorophyll-a solutions of varying concentrations and
gold nanocolloids to characterize inhomogeneous broadening. Results on the
inhomogeneity of gold nanocolloids are also supported by transmission electron micrographs, showing distributions of the size and
shape of the constituent gold nanorods."
11,Topology-Changing Broadband Metamaterials Enabled by Closable Nanotrenches,"ABSTRACT: One of the most straightforward methods to actively control optical
functionalities of metamaterials is to apply mechanical strain deforming the
geometries. These deformations, however, leave symmetries and topologies largely
intact, limiting the multifunctional horizon. Here, we present topology manipulation
of metamaterials fabricated on ﬂexible substrates by mechanically closing/opening
embedded nanotrenches of various geometries. When an inner bending is applied on
the substrate, the nanotrench closes and the accompanying topological change
results in abrupt switching of metamaterial functionalities such as resonance,
chirality, and polarization selectivity. Closable nanotrenches can be embedded in
metamaterials of broadband spectrum, ranging from visible to microwave. The 99.9%
extinction performance is robust, enduring more than a thousand bending cycles.
Our work provides a wafer-scale platform for active quantum plasmonics and
photonic application of subnanometer phenomena."
11,Optically tunable charge carrier injection in monolayer MoS2,"Abstract
We report on excitation laser power-dependent Raman and photoluminescence (PL) measurements on gold nanoparticles–
monolayer ­MoS2 hybrid nanostructures. Excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances in gold nanoparticles and their 
subsequent non-radiative relaxation inject charge carriers (electrons) into the adjacent monolayer ­MoS2. Due to the non-
centrosymmetric nature of monolayer ­MoS2, the localized electron doping induces lattice compression via inverse piezoelec-
tric response. The resultant lattice distortion manifests as a shift as well as broadening of A1g(Γ) and E1
2g(Γ) ­MoS2 Raman 
modes. A splitting of E1
2g(Γ) mode is also observed. The PL spectra reveal power-dependent enhancement of trion feature, 
which again is a signature of an increasing electron doping. The observed effects are confirmed to be doping related as they 
are absent in monolayer ­MoS2 without gold nanoparticles. Our observations reveal that charge carrier injection is effectively 
controlled by varying the excitation laser power, which may aid in optically tuning physical response of ­MoS2 hybrid nano-
structures and devices."

Exciton-surface plasmon polariton (exciton-SPP) interac-

and optical response. The main focus in investigating
these light–matter interactions and nanostructures is to
control the light via light on the nanometric length scale
and ultrafast timescale, not achievable by present photonic
or electronic technologies. Here, we provide a concise
description of the relevant background physics and an over-
view of the manifestations, challenges and applications of
weak and strong exciton-SPP interactions. It is now well
established that semiconductor-metal hybrid nanostruc-
tures oﬀer exciting opportunities to investigate intriguing
quantum phenomena and many-body interactions in con-
densed matter systems even at room temperature. We also
review how exciton-SPP interactions have been inﬂuencing
various research directions. It is amply evident that
a comprehensive understanding of these interactions may
play an important role in several research areas. The recent
progress made in this ﬁeld is expected to give rise to novel
applications of active plasmonic structures.

11,Charge-Induced Lattice Compression in Monolayer MoS2,"ABSTRACT: Electron beam or photonic excitation of localized surface plasmon
resonances (LSPRs) in gold nanoparticles and their subsequent nonradiative
relaxation create a nonuniform charge distribution near the metal−semiconductor
interface via hot-electron injection from gold nanoparticles to the monolayer MoS2
conduction band states. These charge domains induce lattice compression in the
MoS2 lattice because of the inverse piezoelectric response arising due to the
noncentrosymmetric nature of the crystal lattice. Our high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy studies reveal that as much as 9−10% biaxial compressive strain
is generated in free-standing monolayer MoS2 in the vicinity of gold nanoparticles, which relaxes rapidly within 50 nm from the
edge of the gold nanoparticle. The metal interface-induced hot-electron injection via photonic excitation of LSPRs and the
resultant lattice distortion also manifest in shifts as well as broadening of A1g(Γ) and E2g"
11,Strong Dipole Interaction between Chlorophyll-a Molecules and Surface Plasmon Polaritons,"ABSTRACT: The ability of surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs) to localize light on the nanoscale dimensions results
in signiﬁcant ﬁeld enhancement enabling eﬃcient intensiﬁca-
tion of light−matter interactions. Here, we report observation
of strong radiative dipole coupling between molecular excitons
in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and propagating SPPs excited on
gold thin ﬁlms as well as localized SPPs of gold nanoparticles
at room temperature. The optical response of the Chl-a−
metal hybrid nanostructures is investigated in spectral as well
as temporal domains by using various spectroscopy techniques, which reveal polariton formation with a very large coupling
strength of ∼100 meV (24.2 THz). This strong dipole interaction considerably enhances the Chl-a absorption over a much
wider spectrum and gives rise to SPP-exciton polariton emission. The changes in the optical response are also accompanied by
ultrafast relaxation dynamics as well as suppression of luminescence yield. Our results suggest that plasmonic nanostructures can
signiﬁcantly alter optical response of Chl-a molecules via vacuum ﬁeld interactions.

11,Strain and plasmonic field induced modifications of material excitation response in monolayer ,"ABSTRACT
We report Raman and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy studies on monolayer MoS2/gold micro-disc hybrid
structures. The observed frequency shift and broadening of phonon modes of the monolayer MoS2 are mainly the manifestations
of the mechanical strain rather than the plasmonic ﬁeld induced electron doping. We also observe considerable enhancement of
the phonon mode intensities as a consequence of the surface enhanced Raman scattering caused by the plasmonic ﬁelds. The
interaction of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) excited near the edge of the micro-discs with excitons in the mono-
layer MoS2 enhances A exciton emission, while suppressing that from B excitons and the trions. The changes in the PL emission
near the edge are attributed to the modiﬁcation of the emission rate via the Purcell effect, whereas the PL quenching on a rela-
tively ﬂat disc surface is due to lower density and the non-radiative nature of LSPRs.

rently relies mainly on radiotherapy wherein energetic pro-
tons, x-rays, or c-rays are utilized to induce direct and
indirect damage in cellular components such as DNA. It has
been suggested10 that femtosecond laser induced plasma
channels might be a way of avoiding detrimental dose distri-
butions within irradiated tissue—one of the major difﬁculties
in contemporary radiotherapy. Ultrashort pulses of near-
infrared light can readily be spatially conﬁned to volumes
(125 lm3) that are very much smaller than what is cur-
rently attainable using clinical accelerators. Smaller laser-
matter interaction volumes have important implications for
radiation therapy (less collateral damage to healthy tissue)
and also in applications such as multiphoton microscopy
(enhanced image contrast and resolution).11–13 Furthermore,
evidence suggests that plasma channels formed upon 800 nm
laser irradiation may yield almost the same radiation dosage
in the radiolysis of water as in high-energy c-radiation.14 We
report here the results of experiments in which ultrashort
pulses of intense 800 nm light induce SSBs and DSBs in
plasmid DNA suspended in water. We have discovered that
the propensity for strand breaks is signiﬁcantly curtailed
upon addition of salts (such as Na, K, and Mg in physiologi-
cally signiﬁcant concentrations) to the aqueous medium. A
simple electrostatic model rationalizes our observations:
addition of different types and concentrations of salt permits
electrostatic modiﬁcation of the ion atmosphere15 around
DNA such that free radicals are prevented from accessing
DNA strands. The added salts act like shields and permit
the propensity for strand breakages to be electrostatically
“engineered.”

Birefringence is the optical property of a material having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propaga-
tion direction of light. Generally, this is an intrinsic optical property of a material and cannot be altered. Here, we report a 
novel technique—direct laser writing—that enables us to control the natural, material birefringence of sapphire over a broad 
range of wavelengths. The broadband form birefringence originating from self-assembled, periodic array of sub-wavelength

We report on tunnel ionization of Xe by 2-cycle, intense, infrared laser pulses and its dependence
on carrier-envelope-phase (CEP). At low values of optical ﬁeld (E), the ionization yield is maximum
for cos-like pulses with the dependence becoming stronger for higher charge states. At higher E-
values, the CEP dependence either washes out or ﬂips.
A simple phenomenological model is
developed that predicts and conﬁrms the observed results.
CEP eﬀects are seen to persist for
8-cycle pulses. Unexpectedly, electron rescattering plays an unimportant role in the observed CEP

between the maximum of the optical cycle and that of the pulse envelope. CEP-stabilized
laser pulses present opportunities to control, within a ﬁxed intensity pulse, the instantaneous
magnitude of the time-dependent optical ﬁeld. This, in turn, permits control to be exercised
not only on the moment of “birth” of an electron’s wave packet as it tunnels through the
ﬁeld-distorted atomic Coulomb potential but also on its subsequent motion in the oscillating
optical ﬁeld. Theoretical treatments of the intensity-dependent CEP response of an atom in
an ultrashort optical ﬁeld remain a challenge for it necessitates knowledge of the population
probabilities and phases of diﬀerent Floquet states. To this end, it becomes mandatory to
numerically solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in which the ﬁeld-free Hamil-
tonian is supplemented by a term that accounts for the interaction with the optical ﬁeld
[2, 3]. It is, therefore, understandable that theoretical endeavors in this area of strong ﬁeld
science continue to face very formidable hurdles. We present here experimental results on
how ﬁeld-induced single and multiple ionization of Xe atoms by 5 fs pulses of 800 nm light
depends on CEP. The peak intensity of our 2-cycle pulses (2-5 PW cm−2) ensures that the
ionization dynamics occur in the tunneling regime. It is known that the CEP of the driving
laser pulse signiﬁcantly inﬂuences high harmonic generation (HHG) [4], the generation of
isolated attosecond pulses [5], multiphoton ionization [6], and above threshold ionization
(ATI) [7].
Indeed, it is these processes that have attracted overwhelming contemporary
attention vis-`a-vis their dependence on CEP [8]. These phenomena are complex as they in-
volve multiple steps. There remains an acute paucity of information on the CEP dependence
of the quantum mechanical aspects of the primary strong-ﬁeld process - the ﬁeld-induced
distortion of the atomic potential. It is this facet that we explore in the present study as
it provides distinct advantages over exploring CEP dependence of complex processes like
HHG.
HHG is a direct consequence of the electron rescattering process [9]. Within a 2-cycle
pulse, there are multiple instances when the probability of ionization followed by rescattering
of the ionized electron by the ionic core is maximum. The HHG spectrum is a superposition
of the photon emission at all such instances [4], making it diﬃcult to correlate photon
emission with electron dynamics. As we show in the following, the maximum probability for
2
photon emission does not coincide with the peak of the optical ﬁeld. Thus, the manifestation
of CEP dependence is expected to be complicated in the HHG process [4]. In contrast, the
quantum mechanical process of tunnel ionization is a direct manifestation of the ﬁeld-induced
distortion of the atomic potential; its probability is strongly ﬁeld dependent (it maximizes at
the peak of the optical ﬁeld), making this channel extremely CEP-sensitive. Here, we focus
attention on tunnel ionization of a multi-electron atom, Xe which, through generation of high
harmonics, has found widespread utility in attosecond science. We have selected intensity
values that ensure tunnel ionization of Xe: the optical ﬁeld is kept small enough to ensure
that the barrier-suppression regime is not accessed. This has a bearing on the modeling that
we develop to rationalize our observations. Our results show stronger CEP dependence at
lower values of optical ﬁeld (E) and for higher charge states. At higher intensities (∼7 PW
cm−2) sequential ionization can occur: lower charge states formed at the rising edge of the
pulse are further ionized as E approaches its peak value. In such cases, the CEP-dependence
of the lower charge state is either washed out or it ﬂips.
Our phenomenological model
rationalizes these results and also predicts CEP-dependent behavior when longer pulses (22
fs) are used. Our experiments conﬁrm these predictions. Conventional wisdom, for a long
time, was that CEP eﬀects only manifest themselves when the pulse duration is nearly as
short as the optical period. However, theoretical as well as experimental evidence has begun
to oﬀer hints that CEP aﬀects the strong ﬁeld dynamics of atoms even for longer duration
pulses [10, 11], making CEP eﬀects of more widespread signiﬁcance than originally thought.
We have also probed the role of electron rescattering [9] in few-cycle ionization dynamics
and establish that electron kinetic energy values at times when the rescattering probability
is maximum are only marginally aﬀected by CEP. Unexpectedly, rescattering seems to be
relatively unimportant in determining CEP-dependence because the rescattering probability
is not the highest when there is maximum ﬁeld distortion.
We used a Ti:sapphire oscillator (75 MHz repetition rate) whose pulses were ampliﬁed by
a 4-pass ampliﬁer, then stretched to ∼200 ps, before being directed through an acousto-optic
dispersive ﬁlter that controlled pulse shape and duration. The resulting output passed, via
an electro-optical modulator (which down-converted to 1 kHz repetition rate), to a 5-pass
ampliﬁer and compressor to yield a 22 fs pulse which was further compressed to 5 fs by a
1-m-long Ne-ﬁlled hollow ﬁber and a set of chirped dielectric mirrors. For CEP stabilization
we used a fast-loop in the oscillator and a slow-loop in the ampliﬁer [12]. Interferometric

We report temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) studies and PL relaxation dynamics
for uncoated and silver-coated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Room-temperature photoluminescence
studies indicate that the presence of silver coating on CdS QD samples enhances the blue lumines-
cence corresponding to the band-to-band transitions by a factor of ten compared to the uncoated
samples. Furthermore, the decay time measurements using Time Correlated Single Photon Count-
ing technique demonstrate F¨orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between silver-shell and

spectra of uncoated CdS QD samples reveals the role of thermally-activated surface-trap states,
exciton-LO phonon coupling and ionized impurity scattering. In case of silver-coated QDs, the
temperature-dependent PL peak energy corresponding to the band-to-band transitions presents
a consecutive red-blue-red shift (S-shaped) behavior. Whereas, the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) shows a successive blue-red-blue shift (inverted S-shaped) characteristic with increasing
temperature.

Bound- and excited-state electronic nonlinearities in CdS quantum dots have been investigated
by Degenerate Four-Wave Mixing (DFWM) and Z-scan techniques in the femtosecond time regime.
This QD sample shows Kerr-type nonlinearity for incident beam intensity below 0.18 TW/cm2.
However, further increment in intensity results in four-photon absorption (4PA) indicated by open-
and closed-aperture Z-scan experiments. Comparing open-aperture Z-scan experimental results
with theoretical models, the 4PA coeﬃcient α4 has been deduced. Furthermore, third-order non-
linear index γ and refractive-index change coeﬃcient σr corresponding to excited-state electrons
due to 4PA have been calculated from the closed-aperture Z-scan results. UV-visible absorption
and photoluminescence experimental results are analyzed towards estimating band gap energy and
defect state energy. Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) was employed to deter-
mine the decay time corresponding to band-edge and defect states. The linear and nonlinear optical
techniques have allowed the direct observation of lower and higher-order electronic states in CdS

Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system heterogeneity
in practical scenarios. To enhance the capabilities of most model-homogeneous FL
methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can
extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our
study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings
and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client
performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in
contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradient distributions indicate
the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo
Aggregation that leverages internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients
from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity
in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients.
Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous
FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand
their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results
validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer
gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogeneous FL.

12,AOC-IDS: Autonomous Online Framework with,"Abstract—The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT)
has raised increasing concern about targeted cyber attacks.
Previous research primarily focused on static Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs), which employ offline training to safeguard IoT
systems. However, such static IDSs struggle with real-world
scenarios where IoT system behaviors and attack strategies can
undergo rapid evolution, necessitating dynamic and adaptable
IDSs. In response to this challenge, we propose AOC-IDS, a
novel online IDS that features an autonomous anomaly detection
module (ADM) and a labor-free online framework for contin-
ual adaptation. In order to enhance data comprehension, the
ADM employs an Autoencoder (AE) with a tailored Cluster
Repelling Contrastive (CRC) loss function to generate distinctive
representation from limited or incrementally incoming data in
the online setting. Moreover, to reduce the burden of manual
labeling, our online framework leverages pseudo-labels automat-
ically generated from the decision-making process in the ADM
to facilitate periodic updates of the ADM. The elimination of
human intervention for labeling and decision-making boosts the
system’s compatibility and adaptability in the online setting to
remain synchronized with dynamic environments. Experimental
validation using the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demon-
strates the superior performance and adaptability of AOC-IDS,
surpassing the state-of-the-art solutions. The code is released at
https://github.com/xinchen930/AOC-IDS."
12,Digital Object Identifier no. 10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326943,"Abstract—The correlation between children’s personal and family characteristics (e.g., demographics and socioeconomic status) and
their physical and mental health status has been extensively studied across various research domains, such as public health, medicine,
and data science. Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children’s health and aid in the development
of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context
data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges
have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and
learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal
features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design
requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains
(e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers
in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children’s health status from multi-level perspectives.
Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature
importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies,
and expert interviews in associated domains."

12,Human Activity Recognition From Motion and Acoustic Sensors Using Contrastive Learning,"ABSTRACT
In this paper, we formulate human activity recognition as a
downstream task of pretrained multimodal contrastive learn-
ing (MCL) models and break the convention of the one-
modality-to-one-modality contrastive paradigm by allowing
the models to have more than one source modality. Differ-
ent from the prevailing assumption in MCL that one source
modality and one target modality are the counterparts of each
other, this work considers the possibility where it takes mul-
tiple source modalities with complementary information to
match up to a target modality. In particular, we leverage a
large-scale pretrained audio-language contrastive model and
extend it to accepting IMU and audio input.
The experi-
ment results indicate the superiority of using complementary
source modalities over using any source modality alone with
10.3% to 35.0% performance gain."

12,Radio2Speech: High Quality Speech Recovery from Radio Frequency Signals,"Abstract
Considering the microphone is easily affected by noise and
soundproof materials, the radio frequency (RF) signal is a
promising candidate to recover audio as it is immune to noise
and can traverse many soundproof objects. In this paper, we in-
troduce Radio2Speech, a system that uses RF signals to recover
high quality speech from the loudspeaker. Radio2Speech can
recover speech comparable to the quality of the microphone,
advancing from recovering only single tone music or incompre-
hensible speech in existing approaches. We use Radio UNet to
accurately recover speech in time-frequency domain from RF
signals with limited frequency band. Also, we incorporate the
neural vocoder to synthesize the speech waveform from the es-
timated time-frequency representation without using the con-
taminated phase. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show
that in quiet, noisy and soundproof scenarios, Radio2Speech
achieves state-of-the-art performance and is on par with the mi-
crophone that works in quiet scenarios."
12,An End-to-End Network for Continuous Human Motion Recognition via Radar Radios,"Abstract—Micro-Doppler-basedcontinuous human motion
recognition (HMR) has gained considerableattention recently.
However, existing methods mainly rely on individual recurrent
neural network or sliding-window-based approaches, which
makes them hard to effectively exploit all the temporal infor-
mation to predictmotions. Additionally,they need to represent
the raw radardata into other domainsand then performfeature
extraction and classiﬁcation. Thus, the representation cannot
be optimized, and its high computational complexity and
independence from learning model make the network con-
sume signiﬁcant time. In this article, to address these issues,
we propose a new end-to-end network that uses radar radios
to recognize continuous motion. Speciﬁcally, the fusion layer
fuses the raw I & Q radar data without the need of representations, and it is integrated with subsequent networks in
an end-to-end manner for jointly optimization. Moreover, the attention-based encoder-decoder structure encodes the
fused data and selects useful temporal information for recognition, which guarantees the effective use of all the temporal
information. The experiments show that in continuous HMR, the proposed network outperforms existing methods in terms
of accuracy and inference time."
12,Continuous Human Motion Recognition Using Micro-Doppler Signatures in the Scenario With Micro Motion Interference,"Abstract—The application of micro-Doppler-based contin-
uous human motion recognition (HMR) is greatly hindered by
non-target micro motion interference, due to the deformation
of micro-Doppler signatures of target human motion caused
by such interference. In this paper, we propose a novel
continuous HMR method using micro-Doppler signatures
that can work in the scenario with non-target micro motion
interference. Speciﬁcally, a signal preprocessing architecture
is designed, where the empirical mode decomposition is
employed to remove the interference in radar raw signal
and the multiwindow time-frequency representation is used
to generate the time-frequency distribution (TFD) with high
concentration. Moreover, a tailored network, that integrates
multiscale squeeze-and-excitationnetwork for feature sequence extraction, stacked bidirectional long short-term memory
for sequence labeling and connectionisttemporal classiﬁcationalgorithm for label transcription, is employed to recognize
continuous human motion from TFD. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in terms of recognition accuracy and generalization."
12,Classification of Human Motions Using Micro-Doppler Radar in the Environments with Micro-Motion Interference,"Abstract: Human motion classiﬁcation based on micro-Doppler eﬀect has been widely used in various
ﬁelds. However, the motion classiﬁcation performance would be greatly degraded if the wireless
environment has non-target micro-motion interference. In this case, the interference signal aliases with
the signal of target human motions and then generates cross-terms, making the signals hard to be used
to identify target human motions. Existing methods do not consider this non-target micro-motion
interference and have poor resistance to such interference. In this paper, we propose a target human
motion classiﬁcation system that can work in the scenarios with non-target micro-motion interference.
Speciﬁcally, we build a continuous wave radar transceiver working in a low-frequency radar band
using the software deﬁned radio equipment Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 to
collect signals. Moreover, we use Empirical Mode Decomposition and S-transform successively to
remove non-target micro-motion interference and improve the time-frequency resolution of the raw
signal. Then, an Energy Aggregation method based on S-method is proposed, which can suppress
cross-terms and background noise. Furthermore, we extract a set of features and classify four human
motions by adopting Bagged Trees. Extensive experiments using the test-bed show that under the
scenarios with non-target micro-motion interference, 97.3% classiﬁcation accuracy can be achieved."
13,MEMS Thermo-Nanomechanical Membrane Flexure (T-NMF) Device for Temperature Sensing,"Abstract—A promising choice for mechanical sensing appli-
cations is the nanomechanical cantilever sensor (NMC), which
converts physical change on the cantilever surface into nanome-
chanical motion that may be detected by suitable transduction
techniques. Structural modification of this device into an op-
timized membrane-based sensor platform and the integration
of highly sensitive transduction materials to the NMC sensors
can lead to appreciable enhancement in the performance of
the sensor, thereby creating an ultra-sensitive nanomechanical
sensor platform. This paper reports the development of a MEMS
Thermo-Nanomechanical Membrane Flexure (T-NMF) sensor for
meeting the demand for a highly sensitive, miniaturized, real-
time temperature sensor, based on the principle of deflection of
the bimorph membrane with change in temperature, due to the
difference in thermal coefficients of expansion of different layers
of materials present on the membrane. Four inverse trapezoidal
flexures are used to suspend the circular membrane of the T-NMF
sensor. The two layers of the membrane are selected to be silicon
and aluminum. A thin film of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), which
has a high gauge factor, is deposited as a piezoresistor on each of
the flexures, for electromechanical transduction. The design and
simulation of the T-NMF sensor is carried out using COMSOL
Multiphysics 6.0 software, after optimizing the beam geometry.
This optimized design showed an improved thermal sensitivity of
around 2 times higher than that of the conventional cantilever
bimorph sensor of comparable dimensions."

The sensor consists of a suspended polymer (SU-8) MEMS based RFM structure holding the gate of
the SGFET with the gas sensing layer on top of the outer ring. During gas adsorption, the polymer
ring–ﬂexure–membrane architecture ensures a constant gate capacitance change throughout the gate
area of the SGFET. This leads to efﬁcient transduction of the gas adsorption-induced nanomechanical
motion input to the change in the output current of the SGFET, thus improving the sensitivity. The
sensor performance has been evaluated for sensing hydrogen gas using the ﬁnite element method
(FEM) and TCAD simulation tools. The MEMS design and simulation of the RFM structure is carried
out using CoventorWare 10.3, and the design, modelling, and simulation of the SGFET array is

The pseudo short channel effect in suspended gate FET (SGFET)
is discussed, and the channel length of USG-SOIFET is reduced
to 0.95 µm with an air-gap of 200 nm. This helps in improving the

with a mechanical sensitivity of 0.08 nm/nN and a resonant
frequency of 3.8 kHz. The air-gap values for different forces are
obtained from the ﬁnite element method (FEM) simulation of
MEMS structure and used as input to TCAD for USG-SOIFET
simulations to get the ﬁnal sensor response. The area of the sensor
is only (0.38×0.38) mm2 with a sensitivity of 0.425 µA/nN at an

The

used througha closed-loopintegral controland a high-voltage
dynamically reconﬁgurable charge pump, which generates a
high-voltage differential drive of up to 10.5 ± 5.12 V, to drive
an actuator that brings the gate back to its resting position.
The actuator used is a comb-drive type electromechanical actuator. In this work, two tools, viz., MEMS+ and Technology
Computer Aided Design (TCAD) device simulation tools are used in a sequential manner to handle the electrostatics
coupled with the micro-mechanical domain present in the suspended gate ﬁeld effect transistors (SGFET). The results
obtained are then used as look-up-tables for the design and simulation of the entire system, including the control circuits,
in SPECTRE. Appropriate design of the MEMS suspended structure, the ﬁeld effect transistor (FET) device, and interface
circuit results in a open-loop sensitivity of 927 mV/g with a near-zero cross-axis sensitivity. Using the actuator and the

resolution of 109.31 μg/(Hz)1/2. This article also presents a
detailed analysis of the relation between the number of gate
fragments, the pull-in voltage, stable driving range, and the
DR along with a feasible fabrication integration plan."
13,A CMOS-MEMS Accelerometer With U-Channel Suspended Gate SOI FET,"Abstract—There have always been demands for the devel-
opment of microscale sensors with integrated miniature elec-
tronics circuitry. Requirement of external ampliﬁcation for
the conventional MEMS accelerometer poses limitation on
scaling, design, fabrication and on-chip Integrated Circuit (IC)
compatibility. These limitations could be surpassed by the
implementation of integrated CMOS-MEMS architectures for
sensors and actuators. Here a novel U-channel suspended
gate silicon on insulator ﬁeld effect transistor (USG-SOIFET)
is proposed to circumvent the pseudo short channel effects
(P-SCE) present in the suspended gate ﬁeld effect transistor
(SGFET). In the proposed USG-SOIFET, the source and drain
are separated by an air-gap and thereby ensuring effective
screening of drain electric ﬁeld penetration into source region. The gate length (L) of USG-SOIFET is 4 times lower than
the conventional planar channel SGFET for the same performance of the device. Since the same performance is achieved
with a smaller length, this results in a smaller device. Finite Element Modeling (FEM) of USG-SOIFET z-axis accelerometer

13,Polymer/Ceramic MEMS: A Nanomechanical Sensor Platform With Low Temperature High Gauge Factor ITO for Electromechanical Transduction,"Abstract—MEMS biochemical sensors based on nanome-
chanical cantilevers (NMC) translate bio/chemical interactions
into nanomechanical motion that can be detected by various
transduction techniques. Polymer Nanomechanical Sensors have
proven to be better candidates than the conventional silicon
MEMS sensors owing to better sensor performance, ease of
fabrication and cost effectiveness. In this paper, the development
of novel polymer nanomechanical cantilever sensor platform with
a high gauge factor Indium tin oxide (ITO) as piezoresistor for
electrical transduction has been discussed. With simple and cost-
effective polymer MEMS process integration, low temperature
deposited ITO has been incorporated for efﬁcient electromechan-
ical transduction of SU-8 microcantilever devices. The fabricated
SU-8/ITO microcantilevers were experimentally characterized
for extracting the mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical
properties. These SU-8/ ITO devices exhibited strong negative
piezoresistive behavior with the experimentally extracted gauge
factor of ITO as −779. These devices show displacement sensi-
tivity of 37 ppm/nm, which is nearly 30 times that of reported
values of SU-8 cantilevers with nanocomposites as strain sensitive
layer. The surface stress sensitivity is found to be 49.8 ppm

13,Design and optimization of MEMS piezoelectric energy harvester for low frequency applications,"Abstract
Piezoelectric vibrational energy harvester (PVEH) suits best for harvesting vibrational energy from the environment due to
the simplicity in design, operation, and compatibility with the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology. In
this work, the effect of geometrical parameters on the performance of an Aluminium Nitride (AlN) based MEMS PVEH is
analyzed in detail and optimized for lower resonant frequency and higher output power. Electromechanical modeling and
validation are carried out for an energy harvester with various proof mass shapes. The optimized PVEH is having a
trapezoidal beam and a triangular-shaped proof mass. The effect of the amount of proof mass coverage on the performance
parameters is also analyzed. The least resonant frequency is found for the design in which the proof mass coverage is 57 %
of the overall length of the harvester and the power peaks when the proof mass coverage becomes 80 %. The proposed
structure generated output power of 0.24 lW at a resonant frequency of 158.8 Hz when an input acceleration of 0.5 g is
applied. Then an array using the proposed structure is simulated and compared to an array of conventional rectangular
energy harvesters and it is found that array using the proposed structure provides"
13,Three-axis Piezoresistive MEMS Accelerometer with Extended Twin Mass Structure,"Abstract—In this paper, we report the design and Finite
Element Analysis (FEA) based simulation of a novel three-
axis MEMS piezoresistive accelerometer with high resonant
frequency and sensitivity. The design of this accelerometer
allows extended bandwidth without compromising the sensi-
tivities in all the three axes. The accelerometer also exhibits
good cross-axis performance. The resonant frequency can
be increased further without affecting the sensitivity of our
proposed device by reducing the length of the intermediate
beam. We have suggested a new approach to reduce the
length of the intermediate beam by extending the proof mass
into the intermediate beam. The resulting device showed an
increase in the mode 1 frequency by 2 kHz along with a
considerable increase in the z-axis acceleration sensitivity by
10 microvolts for 1 g of acceleration. Whereas, the device with
direct reduction of length of the intermediate beams exhibited
an increase in the mode 1 frequency by 2 kHz without any
improvement in the sensitivity."
13,Novel Polymer MEMS Capacitive Hydrogen sensor with Palladium Ring on Membrane-Mass Architecture,"Abstract—In this paper, we report a novel high sensitivity
polymer MEMS based capacitive hydrogen gas sensor on a
membrane-mass architecture. The novel design of the sensor
along with the use of SU-8 as structural layer materials allows
the sensor to effectively transduce the hydrogen gas absorption
to large capacitance change. The sensor is simulated using
a ﬁnite element analysis software (FEA) and the mechanical
and electromechanical behavior of the sensor is studied. The
sensor exhibits over 61% capacitance change for 0.5% volume
of hydrogen gas which is 3.8 times higher than previously
reported sensors. The novel sensor design also offers a large
design window to enhance the sensitivity and the gas detection
range."
13,5th Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC),"ABSTRACT
A three dimensional piezoelectric coupled ﬂuid structure interaction simulation have been done using COM-
SOL multiphysics software 5.3a for the performance study of a valveless traveling wave piezoelectric mi-
cropump (VTWP). A complete multiphysics computational domain with applied voltage as an input to the
electrode patch to initiate and sustain the ﬂuid motion has been benchmarked using data from Afrasiab et
al.[1]. The benchmark model of the pump has a length of 5.2mm. The ﬂuid channel is having a width of
200µm and depth of 300µm. The top surface is a silicon diaphragm having a thickness of 6µm with a PZT-
5H thin ﬁlm layer of thickness 2.5µm over it. The VTWP is actuated by nine similar square electrode patches
arranged along the axial direction of the channel. The working ﬂuid is water. The unipolar sinusoidal peak
to peak voltage of 20V with a phase shift 120◦produces a traveling wave in the channel ﬂow direction. Ar-
bitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Method (ALE) has been employed for the ﬂuid-structure interface deformation.
In order to improve the performance of such pumps, the current study looks at two alternative conﬁgura-
tions, one having a nozzle/diffuser (N/D) conﬁguration and the other with a corrugated pump chamber. With
a non-dimensional performance parameter and a non-dimensional ﬂow ratio, the pumps with straight, N/D
and corrugated conﬁgurations are compared for similar non-dimensional back pressure conditions. The pump
with corrugated channel conﬁguration shows better performance for the same back pressure.

The effect of beam geometry and shape of the proof mass on the

13,Polymer Based Hybrid Membrane-Flexure Nanomechanical Piezoresistive Sensor,"Abstract— In this paper, a novel Hybrid Membrane-Flexure 
Nanomechanical (HMF-NM) Piezoresistive Sensor with SU-8 as 
structural material and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) as piezoresistor 
is designed and simulated using commercial finite element analysis 
(FEA) software. SU-8/ITO microcantilever has been fabricated to 
electromechanically extract the piezoresistive property of ITO 
which has been considered for simulation. The simulated device 
consists of a circular membrane coated with receptor layer 
suspended by inverse trapezoidal flexures with embedded 
piezoresistors. Surface stress induced on the membrane due to 
target binding is transduced as a uniaxial stress in the flexures 
which is then sensed using piezoresistors. A conventional polymer 
U-shaped piezoresistive cantilever is also designed and simulated 
for comparison. The surface stress sensitivity of HMF-NM sensor 
is extracted as 4.01 ppm/[mN/m] which is more than 20 times that 
of a conventional cantilever."
13,Out-of-plane dual flexure MEMS piezoresistive accelerometer with low cross axis sensitivity,"Abstract
Accelerometers are one of the widely explored microsensors with many transduction mechanisms. One of the primary
concerns with piezoresistive microaccelerometers is their cross axis sensitivity. The main reason for cross axis response is
the mechanical offset between the ﬂexures and the center of mass of the proofmass. Cross axis sensitivity is generally
minimized electronically using bridge conﬁgurations of piezoresistors or by depositing high density materials like gold
over the proofmass to balance the mechanical structure. Here a novel non planar dual ﬂexure geometry has been proposed
which make the effective beam center of mass to align with that of the proof mass and thereby achieve low cross axis
sensitivity by the mechanical design itself. The hybrid integration of electronic compensation with the mechanical com-
pensation realizes a high performance accelerometer with ultralow cross axis sensitivity. Four piezoresistors placed on one
ﬂexure are conﬁgured such that the output voltage will be maximum for prime axis input while the bridge is balanced for
the inputs along remaining two axes. The analytical model of the proposed structure, and the ﬁnite element analysis results
are discussed. The device exhibits a very low cross axis sensitivity of 0.006% in Y direction and 0.005% in X direction
while maintaining high prime axis sensitivity of 2.28 mV/g. The device also shows very low non linearity (1%) over a
range of 100 g acceleration and a resonant frequency of"
14,A Portable Micro-Gas Chromatography with Integrated Photonic Crystal Slab Sensors on Chip,"Abstract: The miniaturization of gas chromatography (GC) systems has made it possible to utilize the
analytical technique in various on-site applications to rapidly analyze complex gas samples. Various
types of miniaturized sensors have been developed for micro-gas chromatography (µGC). However,
the integration of an appropriate detector in µGC systems still faces a signiﬁcant challenge. We
present a solution to the problem through integration of µGC with photonic crystal slab (PCS) sensors
using transfer printing technology. This integration offers an opportunity to utilize the advantages of
optical sensors, such as high sensitivity and rapid response time, and at the same time, compensate
for the lack of detection speciﬁcity from which label-free optical sensors suffer. We transfer printed a
2D defect free PCS on a boroﬂoat glass, bonded it to a silicon microﬂuidic gas cell or directly to a
microfabricated GC column, and then coated it with a gas responsive polymer. Realtime spectral
shift in Fano resonance of the PCS sensor was used to quantitatively detect analytes over a mass
range of three orders. The integrated µGC–PCS system was used to demonstrate separation and
detection of a complex mixture of 10 chemicals. Fast separation and detection (4 min) and a low
detection limit (ng) was demonstrated."
14,Microfluidic Ionic Liquid Dye Laser,"Abstract:
In this work, by utilizing ionic liquid as the gain medium solvent, which is
a new category of materials, we demonstrated a droplet-based dye laser system in a
co-ﬂowing microﬂuidic device. We characterized the droplet laser system and achieved a
lasing threshold of 40.1 μJ/mm2. Owning to the unique properties of ionic liquids, such as
negligible vapor pressure and good thermal and chemical stability, they offer great potentials
for the development of on-chip light sources, tunable optoﬂuidic devices, and sensitive
biochemical analysis."
14,Reconfigurable Integrated Optofluidic Droplet Laser Arrays,"ABSTRACT: Optoﬂuidic lasers are an emerging technology for the development of miniaturized light sources and biological and
chemical sensors. However, most optoﬂuidic lasers demonstrated to date are operated at the single optical cavity level, which limits
their applications in high-throughput biochemical sensing, high-speed wavelength switching, and on-chip spectroscopic analysis.
Here, we demonstrated an optoﬂuidic droplet laser array on a silicon chip with integrated microﬂuidics, in which four individual
droplet optical cavities are generated and controlled by a 2 × 2 nozzle array. Arrays of droplets with a diameter ranging from 115 to
475 μm can be generated, removed, and regenerated on demand. The lasing threshold of the droplet laser array is in the range of
0.63−2.02 μJ/mm2. An image-based lasing threshold analysis method is developed, which enables simultaneous lasing threshold
measurement for all laser units within the laser array using a low-cost camera. Compared to the conventional spectrum-based
threshold analysis method, the lasing threshold obtained from the image-based method showed consistent results. Our droplet laser
array is a promising technology in the development of cost-eﬀective and integrated coherent light source on a chip for point-of-care
applications."
15,SLPA: Single-Line Pixel Attack on Specific Emitter Identification Using Time-Frequency Spectrogram,"Abstract—Specific emitter identification (SEI) can identify and
characterize individual radio frequency emitters, such as radar
systems or communication devices. The application of deep
learning (DL) techniques in the domain of SEI has gained
significant attention due to its potential for enhancing the
accuracy and efficiency of SEI. Recent studies show that DL-
based SEI is susceptible to adversarial attacks. For SEI based
on the time-frequency spectrogram, we propose a single-line pixel
attack (SLPA) method. The attacker adds the same perturbation
to the time-frequency spectrogram samples line by line and
queries the model recognition results, selecting the RF signal
corresponding to the line with the highest number of successful
attacks as the optimal perturbation signal. This is a practical
black-box attack that does not require synchronization and
knowledge of model parameters. Under the same perturbation
power, our proposed method can achieve an attack success rate of
35.05%, which is much higher than the 20.10% of the white-box
attack fast gradient sign method (FGSM) that requires gradient
information of the target model.

15,An Efficient RFF Extraction Method Using Asymmetric Masked Auto-Encoder,"Abstract—Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) has been
widely used in wireless transceivers as an additional physical
security layer. Most of the existing RFF extraction methods
rely on a large number of labeled signal samples for model
training. However, in real communication environments, it is
usually necessary to process timely received signal samples,
which are limited in quantity and are difficult to obtain labels,
the performance of most RFF methods is generally poor. To ef-
fectively extract features from the limited and unlabeled signal
samples, we propose an efficient RFF extraction method using
an asymmetric masked auto-encoder (AMAE). Specifically, we
design an asymmetric extractor-decoder, where the extractor
is used to learn the latent representation of the masked signals
and the decoder as light as a convolution layer reconstructs
the unmasked signal from the latent representation. Using
commercial off-the-shelf LoRa datasets and WiFi datasets, we
show that the proposed AMAE-based RFF extraction method
achieves the best performance compared with four advanced
unsupervised methods whether in the case of large data size
or small data size, or under line of sight (LOS) and non line of
sight (NLOS) channel scenarios. The codes of this paper can

15,An Open Set Specific Emitter Identification Method Using Deep Feature Embedded Discriminator,"Abstract—Specific emitter identification (SEI) can verify the
identity of transmitter devices. It is playing an increasingly
important role in maintaining internet of things (IoT) security
by allowing legitimate devices to access the core network while
preventing rogue devices intrusion. In recent years, more and
more methods have applied deep learning to SEI. However, most
of the existing works make the assumption of closed sets, which
results in classifiers that can only identify a limited set of known
devices. When closed set classifier is faced with rogue devices, it
will misclassify them as legitimate devices, thereby endangering
IoT security. In this paper, an open set SEI method based on deep
features has been proposed, which can complete the identification
of known devices and the detection of rogue devices by combining
the appropriate transmitter deep feature distance measurement
method and extreme value theory. Experiments on intercom
dataset collected by universal software radio peripheral (USRP)
show that our proposed method is better than other open set
SEI methods. Furthermore, our method is more robust to noise.
The proposed method can effectively solve the problem of open
set SEI, and the detection of rogue devices is more accurate."
15,Attention-CNN-Aided Specific Emitter Identification Method with Limited Radio Frequency Dataset,"Abstract—Speciﬁc emitter identiﬁcation (SEI) plays a more
and more important role to recognize unknown radio frequency
(RF) devices in the ﬁeld of physical layer security. Existing deep
learning (DL)-based SEI methods have been proposed for solving
problems that enough RF dataset can be obtained at the model
training stage. In many real application scenarios, however, only
the limited dataset can be collected which causes the conventional
DL methods unstable. To solve this problem, in this paper, we
propose a robust SEI method using a self-attention mechanism
and convolutional neural network (attention-CNN). To be speciﬁc,
we collect a real RF dataset from the automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signal. Here, the ADS-B dataset
is limited in some special cases and data augmentation is used to
improve the features of the dataset. Simulation results show that
the proposed method achieves better identiﬁcation performance
than the benchmark."
16,RaMaN: A dynamic clustering protocol resilient against colluded role-manipulability and node replication attacks,"Abstract—Clustering in WSNs has been a topic of intense 
research as clustering increases scalability and lifetime of the 
sensor network where sensor nodes are limited in computation 
and battery power. Clustering process in WSNs is prone to 
attacks from inside and outside adversaries. Most of the secure 
clustering 
schemes 
provide 
solutions 
against 
outside 
adversaries but fail in presence of inside malicious nodes.  
Resilient cluster leader election [1] and SecDeach [2] are 
among 
recent 
schemes 
which 
provide 
resilience 
to 
manipulability of a cluster head role in presence of 
compromised nodes. But, Resilient cluster leader election 
scheme [1] does not support dynamic clustering and it is also 
prone to node replication attacks. Though, SecDeach provides 
secure dynamic clustering but it suffers from the attack in 
which compromised nodes collude to manipulate their roles as 
cluster heads after each round. SecDeach is also vulnerable to 
node replication attacks. In this paper, we present a secure 
clustering solution which supports dynamic clustering and 
eliminates the possibility of colluded role manipulability attack 
by malicious nodes which is possible in SecDeach. The 
proposed solution can also handle node replication attacks 
which exist in Resilient cluster leader election scheme and 
SecDeach."
17,Figure panels,"ABSTRACT  
Diverse organ shapes and sizes arise from the complex interplay between cellular properties, 
mechanical forces, and gene regulation. Drosophila wing- a flat structure and the globular 
haltere are two homologous flight appendages emerging from a similar group of progenitor 
cells. The activity of a single Hox transcription factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), governs the 
development of these two distinct organs- wing and haltere with different cell and organ 
morphologies. Our work reported here on differential development of wing and haltere suggest 
that the localisation and abundance of actomyosin complexes, apical cell contractility, 
properties of extracellular matrix, and cell size and shape, which is a result of various cell 
intrinsic and extrinsic forces, plausibly influence the flat vs. globular geometry of these two 
organs. We followed the three-dimensional architecture of developing wing and halteres during 
early pupal morphogenesis, indicating the role of the above-mentioned factors in force 
generation and in driving differential morphogenesis, leading to different organ shapes. Loss 
of Ubx function led to wing cell-like cellular features in haltere discs, and corresponding 
changes at the level of adult organs. We also observed that RNAi-mediated downregulation of 
Atrophin or Pten, in the background of downregulated Expanded (or elevated Yki), gave rise 
to varying degrees of haltere to wing homeotic transformations at the cellular as well as adult 
organ levels. Finally, we provide simulated scenarios based on computational modelling that 
propose key ingredients required for producing wing- or haltere-like morphologies in 
Drosophila.

17,"Genomic surveillance reveals early detection and transition of delta to omicron lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater treatment plants of Pune, India","Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the urgency for rapid public health surveillance methods to detect and monitor the 
transmission of infectious diseases. The wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a promising tool for proactive 
analysis and quantification of infectious pathogens within a population before clinical cases emerge. In the present study, 
we aimed to assess the trend and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants using a longitudinal approach. Our objective included 
early detection and monitoring of these variants to enhance our understanding of their prevalence and potential impact. To 
achieve our goals, we conducted real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Illumina sequencing on 442 
wastewater (WW) samples collected from 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Pune city, India, spanning from November 
2021 to April 2022. Our comprehensive analysis identified 426 distinct lineages representing 17 highly transmissible variants 
of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, fragments of Omicron variant were detected in WW samples prior to its first clinical detection 
in Botswana. Furthermore, we observed highly contagious sub-lineages of the Omicron variant, including BA.1 (~28%),

17,A Micro-evolutionary Change in Target Binding Sites as a Key Determinant of Ultrabithorax Function in Drosophila,"Abstract
Hox genes encode Homeodomain-containing transcription factors, which specify segmental identities along the anterior–
posterior axis. Functional changes in Hox genes have been directly implicated in the evolution of body plans across the 
metazoan lineage. The Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is expressed and required in developing third thoracic (T3) segments 
in holometabolous insects studied so far, particularly, of the order Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. Ubx function is key 
to specify differential development of the second (T2) and T3 thoracic segments in these insects. While Ubx is expressed 
in the third thoracic segment in developing larvae of Hymenopteran Apis mellifera, the morphological differences between 
T2 and T3 are subtle. To identify evolutionary changes that are behind the differential function of Ubx in Drosophila and 
Apis, which are diverged for more than 350 million years, we performed comparative analyses of genome wide Ubx-binding 
sites between these two insects. Our studies reveal that a motif with a TAAAT core is a preferred binding site for Ubx in 
Drosophila, but not in Apis. Biochemical and transgenic assays suggest that in Drosophila, the TAAAT core sequence in 
the Ubx binding sites is required for Ubx-mediated regulation of two of its target genes studied here; CG13222, a gene that 
is normally upregulated by Ubx and vestigial (vg), whose expression is repressed by Ubx in T3. Interestingly, changing the 
TAAT site to a TAAAT site was sufficient to bring an otherwise unresponsive enhancer of the vg gene from Apis under the 
control of Ubx in a Drosophila transgenic assay. Taken together, our results suggest an evolutionary mechanism by which 
critical wing patterning genes might have come under the regulation of Ubx in the Dipteran lineage."

17,Proceedings of the 3rd Indian Cancer Genome Atlas Conference 2022: Biobanking to Omics: Collecting the Global Experience,"abstract
On January 13th and 14th 2022, the Center for Translational Cancer Research organized the virtual third Indian
Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) Conference 2022 “Biobanking to Omics – Collecting the Global Experience.” This
conference was planned as the steppingstone to help ICGA understand the road ahead and the probable
roadblocks in its preparatory phase as ICGA begins to streamline the tumor tissue biobanking and multi-omics
efforts in the Indian subcontinent. The ﬁrst day of the conference was dedicated to updates on the current status
of ICGA, the future prospect, and the global understanding of multi-omics efforts. The key highlights included
two keynote speeches by Dr Wui Jin Koh, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Ofﬁce, National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network, and by Dr Christina Curtis, Associate Professor, Stanford University School of
Medicine. The ﬁrst day ended with an intriguing panel discussion on “ICGA updates and Future Steps.” The
second day focused on biobanking practices across the globe and several aspects of biobank setup such as
infrastructure, maintenance, quality control, patient consent, and lessons learned from established biobanking
setups. The talk by Rosita Kammler, Head, Translational Research Coordination, International Breast Cancer
Study Group, Switzerland, and Ruhul Amin, Director, Bangladesh Medical Research Council were the key
highlights. The second day also ended with an engaging panel discussion on “Tumor tissue biobanking –
national and international perspectives.” Overall, the conference was well received and had good attendance
from national and international students, researchers, and faculty from academia as well as industry.

Following the concept of The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA-NCI), the idea of setting up a pan-India con-
sortium to document heterogeneity within cancers in an
Indian context was conceived in the 2019-2020
conferences.1 Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA)
foundation thus was established in 2021 with the ob-
jective of enabling documentation of genetic and mo-
lecular heterogeneity for cancer cohorts in India that will
set a way forward in making cancer treatment per-
sonalized for the Indian population.
The ﬁrst, independent ICGA conference and 3rd in the
series was organized by the Center for Translational
Cancer Research (CTCR) in January 2022. The con-
ference was envisioned as the stepping stone to help
ICGA understand the way ahead and the potential
roadblocks when initiating a national project of this scale.
One of the cornerstones for the successful setting up of
the ICGA project is the establishment of a cancer tissue
repository with all the standard operating procedures
and approvals. Such a biobank will yield high-quality
genomic data along with clinical data to set up an open-
sourced database accessible to the global scientiﬁc
community.
The 3rd ICGA Conference 2022 thus was aptly themed
“Biobanking to Omics—Collecting the Global Experi-
ence” with the aim of guiding the ICGA biobanking
efforts. The conference was a composite of talks from
the ICGA group and renowned national and interna-
tional faculty. The conference talks focused on the
biobanking setup and maintenance process, updates
from ICGA on its progress, future perspective, and the
ongoing cancer research in India. The two keynote talks
focused on the lessons learned from the METABRIC
study by Dr Christina Curtis, Stanford University, and on
the potential impact ICGA could have on the adapted
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for
the Indian Subcontinent by Dr Wui-Jin Koh, National
Comprehensive Cancer Network.
The comprehensive proﬁling efforts in United States and
United Kingdom such as METABRIC, TCGA, and 100K
Genome Project have already shown how metadata can
help us tailor personalized treatment with a deeper
understanding of the molecular signatures and asso-
ciated best treatment strategies available as of today.

new and region-speciﬁc incidence and penetration of ge-
nomic alterations. The proﬁling especially may beneﬁt in
understanding a prevalent aggressive breast cancer sub-
type, triple negative breast cancer, at a molecular level and
enable
the
development
of
a
personalized
cancer
management plan.
To achieve such proﬁling of patients with cancer pan-India,
we need efforts at the consortium level to include clinical
setups across the country from various regions and the
academic researchers to ensure the best quality of mo-
lecular proﬁling and data analysis. To ensure best quality of
data, we need to conﬁrm that the sample quality is up to the
mark and maintained with the best biobanking practices.
With such a large-scale effort being undertaken by ICGA, to
ensure best implementation and outcome, we gathered
expertise from around the world to learn about the best
biobanking practices and its utility toward better clinical
management.
The Indian health scenario is plagued with many issues,
including record keeping, obtaining appropriate informed
consent, and quality assurance of biospecimens collected.
These are issues that many biobanks in India are already
facing and working to mitigate. At this conference, a mix of
national and international faculty such as Dr Rosina Ahmed
(TMC, Kolkata, India), Ms Rosita Kammler (IBCSG, Switzer-
land), Dr Pallavi Kshetrapal (THSTI, India), and Dr Anjana
Kulkarni (Guy’s Hospital-NHS, London, United Kingdom)
discussed the signiﬁcant issues faced by biobanks in India
and the steps that can be taken to address these issues at the
outset. The ICGA biobanking standard operating procedures
would be developed taking into consideration these issues
and the ways to tackle them. Some of the challenges could be
overcome by engaging the clinicians of the participating
hospital and providing counseling on effective clinical data
collection of the patients. In addition, conducting training for
the support staff at both the participating hospitals and the
ICGA Biobank on best practices will be critical.
Setting up an internationally competitive state-of-the-art
Biobank with accompanying clinical, pathologic, and
molecular information will be essential for translating basic
research into a clinical setting. Management and appli-
cation of the clinical and biologic data accessed through
biobanks and clinical databases were discussed through
talks by Prof Subhashis Banerjee (Asoka University), Dr
Bushra Ateeq (IIT, Kanpur, India), Dr Madhura Kulkarni
(PCCM-CTCR, India), and Prof Dr Md Ruhul Amin (BMRC,
Bangladesh).
The panel discussion on both days also addressed the
problems of implementing standards in data collection
throughout the study. The panel discussion on ICGA updates
took a deep dive into the quality of cancer care in India, its
evolution over time, and what role ICGA could play in im-
proving this and drew interesting discussion among the
panelists. The clinicians on board at ICGA such as Prof
Chintamani (Safdarjung Hospital, India), Prof Sudeep Gupta
(ACTREC-TMC, India), and Dr C.B. Koppiker (PCCM-CTCR,
India) all highlighted the fact that the improvements in clinical
research in the past 2 decades in India have led to a sub-
stantial improvement in cancer care along with better access.
They also acknowledged that the gap between the clinicians
and the researchers needs to be bridged by fostering col-
laborations among the hospitals, academic research insti-
tutes, and possibly industrial partners to catalyze this change.
ICGA could play a signiﬁcant role in building an ecosystem
by conducting cross-disciplinary training programs that will
eventually lead to more translational research programs.
Dr Zenklusen (TCGA-NCI, USA) and Dr Badve (Emory
University, USA) agreed that putting the project ahead and
working toward the goals of the ICGA will help in successful
implementation. All the panelists pointed out that obtaining
good-quality samples and longitudinal follow-up data will
be imperative to generate meaningful outcomes.
In keeping with the theme, day-2 ﬁnished with a panel
discussion on tumor tissue biobanking—national and in-
ternational perspectives. Dr Lokesh Aggarwal (NCI, USA)
CONTEXT
Key Objective
With the establishment of the Indian Cancer Genome Atlas (ICGA) foundation in 2021, the Center for Translational Cancer
Research organized the 3rd ICGA Conference 2022, “Biobanking to Omics—Collecting the Global Experience,” to guide
the ICGA biobanking and tumor multiomics efforts in the Indian subcontinent.
Knowledge Generated
The ﬁrst day of the conference was dedicated to updates on the current status of ICGA, the future prospect, and global understanding
of multiomics efforts. The highlights included two keynote speeches by Dr Wui Jin Koh, National Comprehensive Cancer Network
and Dr Christina Curtis, Stanford University. The ﬁrst day ended with an intriguing panel discussion on “ICGA updates and Future
Steps.” The second day focused on biobanking practices across the globe and several aspects of biobank setup.
Relevance
Overall, the conference had an overwhelming response with key insights into aspects of biobanking setup for clinical research.
Herein, we describe the signiﬁcant takeaways from the conference.

lucidly summarized the pressure points for each milestone
of setting up and managing a biobank—from the creation of
standard operating procedures, sample annotation, and
analyte traceability. Prof Mahalingam (IIT-Madras, India)
further explained these challenges in the Indian scenario,
discussing the Indian Council of Medical Research
guidelines on ethical clearance at clinical and research
sites. Dr Jugnu Jain (Sapien Biosciences, India) described
the challenges she faced when setting up one of the ﬁrst
commercial biobanks in India. Dr Juhi Tayal (RGCIRC,
India) discussed the prioritization of patient care over tissue
collection and the importance of addressing patient con-
cerns through detailed consent forms. Dr Aruna Korlimarla
(SSCHRC, India) discussed requirements for specialized
infrastructure for biobanks elaborating that facility design
requires careful consideration of, at times, competing
requirements.
Given the diversity of the Indian population, the incidence
and prevalence of cancers in India are also relatively
different compared with the western population. As with
the global scenario, breast cancer is among the most
common cancers in Indian women as well.2 However, the
demographic distribution and clinical features of patients
with breast cancer in India are signiﬁcantly different
compared with those of the world.3-6 Hence, the pilot
phase of ICGA will be the collection of breast cancer
tissues from across the country.
As ICGA plans to move ahead, signiﬁcant progress has been
made despite the setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pan-
demic. ICGA has been registered as a section 8 company and
has secured the ﬁnancial backing for the multiomics se-
quencing from Council of Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research,
Government of India. With the technology solutions in place
and the study documents in process for approvals, ICGA is
expected to kick start the project this year. ICGA is expected to
create an infrastructure with efﬁcient management of bio-
specimens on a large scale, which can be made available to
researchers on appropriate legal and ethical approvals. This
will greatly enhance interdisciplinary translational research to
accelerate the progress of personalized medical care.
From the organizers’ perspective, the 3rd edition of the
ICGA conference (the previous two conferences were
called
TCGA-India)
successfully
connected
people
working at the ground level on various phases of trans-
lational cancer research. ICGA will provide a common
platform for clinicians, translational and basic biology
researchers, diagnostic laboratory personnel, multiomics
experts, and data scientists, etc to come together and
work in synergy. In the not-too-distant future, we envision
our ability to provide excellent health care to patients
with cancer with the help of advanced knowledge and
technology on a real-time basis. With our shared ethnic,
nutritional, and geoclimatic backgrounds, India and its
neighboring countries such as Bangladesh working to-
gether will be mutually beneﬁcial.
ICGA (as a not-for-proﬁt section 8 company)7 will com-
mence operations in 2022 with TCGA mentorship. ICGA will
also undertake capacity building to train the next gener-
ation of scientists, clinicians, and health care workers by
engaging them through regular training workshops, con-
ferences, and symposiums toward the long-term goal.

17,Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in molecular subtypes of an Indian cohort of breast cancer patients,"Abstract 
Objectives:  Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) distribution in an Indian cohort of breast cancer 
patients for its prognostic significance.
Methods:  A retrospective cohort of breast cancer patients from a single onco-surgeon’s breast cancer clinic with a 
uniform treatment strategy was evaluated for TILs. Tumor sections were H&E stained and scored for the spatial distri-
bution and percent stromal TILs infiltration by a certified pathologist. The scores were analysed for association with 
treatment response and survival outcomes across molecular subtypes.
Results:  Total 229 breast cancer tumors were evaluated. Within spatial distribution categories, intra-tumoral TILs 
were observed to be associated with complete pathological response and lower recurrence frequency for the entire 
cohort. Subtype-wise analysis of stromal TILs (sTILs) re-enforced significantly higher infiltration in TNBC compared to 
HER2-positive and ER-positive tumors. A favourable association of higher stromal infiltration was observed with treat-
ment response and disease outcomes, specifically in TNBC.
Conclusion:  Intra-tumoral TILs showed a higher proportion with favourable association with better patient out-
comes in an Indian cohort, unlike western cohorts where both stromal and intra-tumoral TILs show similar associa-
tion with prognosis. With further validation, TILs can be developed as a cost-effective surrogate marker for treatment 
response, especially in a low-resource setting such as India."
17,Building Sustainable Societies through Purpose-Driven Universities: A Case Study from Ashoka University (India),"Abstract: Sustainable Development (SD) is the universal essentiality of present times, and universities
have a critical role in implementing this initiative through their functioning, policies and practices.
To integrate SD goals, universities should have a global outlook that is still locally rooted in its
strategies. In the last decade, various theories and recommendations have been proposed and
adopted globally for integrating sustainability in higher education systems. In India, environmental
education has been mandated at all formal levels in the education system. Still, there is a strong
argument that it is not simply a matter of overhauling syllabi and curricula. Instead, universities
should be incorporating SD goals into their research and their own operations. Our study aims to
investigate the sustainability model of Ashoka University (India) that approaches its commitment
through sustainability-focused courses, research, and operations. This study involves an in-depth
literature review and uses an established framework to assess the condition of the university towards
sustainability issues. Our case study employed observations, data collections, document reviews,
and interactions with different stakeholders. The study concludes that the university is mostly
in adherence with the framework at this stage. Critical areas of future development within the
framework are proposed considering the global context. This research serves as an entry point for
evaluating sustainability issues of the Indian higher education system, and hopes to motivate higher
education communities to do further research to improve their sustainability performance and their
role as agents of change."

Objectives 
To assess seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a densely populated 
urban Indian settings and its implications for disease trends and protective immunity. 
Design 
Cross-sectional sero-epidemiological survey linked with administrative reporting of 
COVID-19 testing data.  
Settings  
Pune city in western India  
Main outcome measure 
Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were estimated and along 
with correlates of virus neutralisation and other immune and inflammatory markers. 
Results 
Seropositivity was extensive (51·3%; 95%CI 39·9 to 62·4) but varied widely in the 
five localities tested, ranging from 35·8% to 66·4%. Seropositivity was higher in 
crowded living conditions in the slums (OR 1·91), and was lower in those 65 years or 
older (OR 0·59). The infection-fatality ratio was estimated at 0.21%. Post survey, 
COVID-19 incidence was lower in areas noted to have higher seroprevalence. 
Substantial virus-neutralising activity was observed in seropositive individuals, but 
with considerable heterogeneity in the immune response and possible age-
dependent diversity in the antibody repertoire. 
Conclusion 
Despite crowded living conditions having facilitated widespread transmission, the 
variability in seroprevalence in localities that are in geographical proximity indicates a 
heterogenous spread of infection. Declining infection rates in areas with high 
seropositivity suggest population-level protection. It is also supported by substantial 
neutralising activity in asymptomatically infected individuals. This is the first report of 
a significantly high proportion of protective immune response among asymptomatic 
individuals in the population. The heterogeneity in antibody levels and neutralisation 
capacity indicates the existence of immunological sub-groups of functional interest.

17,genet303419 67..77,"ABSTRACT Promoter proximal pausing (PPP) of RNA polymerase II has emerged as a crucial rate-limiting step in the regulation of gene
expression. Regulation of PPP is brought about by complexes 7SK snRNP, P-TEFb (Cdk9/cycT), and the negative elongation factor
(NELF), which are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans. Here, we show that RNAi-mediated depletion of bin3 or Hexim of the
7SK snRNP complex or depletion of individual components of the NELF complex enhances Yki-driven growth, leading to neoplastic
transformation of Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We also show that increased CDK9 expression cooperates with Yki in driving
neoplastic growth. Interestingly, overexpression of CDK9 on its own or in the background of depletion of one of the components
of 7SK snRNP or the NELF complex necessarily, and speciﬁcally, needed Yki overexpression to cause tumorous growth. Genome-wide
gene expression analyses suggested that deregulation of protein homeostasis is associated with tumorous growth of wing imaginal
discs. As both Fat/Hippo/Yki pathway and PPP are highly conserved, our observations may provide insights into mechanisms of
oncogenic function of YAP—the ortholog of Yki in humans."
18,Electrochemical Investigation of TLR4&#x002F;MD-2-Immobilized Polyaniline and Hollow Polyaniline Nanofibers: Toward Real-Time Triaging of Gram-Negative Bacteria Responsible for Delayed Wound Healing,"Abstract—Detecting gram −ve bacterial colonies is crucial in address-
ing the clinical challenges associated with chronic wounds and de-
layed healing. These bacteria can exacerbate wound conditions,
hindering natural healing and potentially leading to infections. The
electrochemical sensing platform presented in this study serves as a
valuable tool for healthcare professionals to make timely and targeted
treatment decisions. Toward this, we developed a cost-effective elec-
trochemical sensing platform leveraging the TLR4/MD-2 complex to
detect gram −ve bacterial colonies. Our biosensors were meticulously
fashioned using polyaniline (PANi) and hollow PANi (HPANi) nanoﬁbers. Notably, the HPANi-based sensors, owing to
their distinctive hollow structure, facilitated ampliﬁed responses under comparable experimental conditions compared
with PANi-based counterparts. The designed sensing platform demonstrated exceptional accuracy in identifying Es-
cherichia coli (gram −ve), showcasing a theoretical detection limit of 0.215 CFU/mL for PANi and a remarkably improved
0.14 CFU/mL for HPANi. These sensors displayed outstanding selectivity for gram −ve bacteria, even amidst gram +ve
bacteria and fungi. Moreover, our platform demonstrated remarkable sensitivity, yielding 3.04 ((R/R)/CFU/mL)/cm2
for the HPANi-based sensor, surpassing the performance of the PANi-based sensor at"
18,An ultrasensitive and selective PPY-fMWCNT nanocomposite electrical-transducer based Chemiresistive immunosensing platform for early detection of Alzheimer&#x0027;s,"Abstract — Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form 
of dementia associated with progressive loss of neuronal cells due 
to progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (AB/Aβ) peptides in 
plaque form. Early diagnosis is the key to effective AD treatment, 
which can be carried out by detecting Aβ 1-40 (AB40) and Aβ 1-42 
(AB42) potential biomarkers in easily accessible body fluids at sub 
pico gram per mL. With this aim, we have developed carboxylic 
functionalized 
multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes 
(fMWCNTs) 
embedded Polypyrrole (PPY) nanocomposite (PPY-fMWCNT) 
based highly sensitive and selective chemiresistive immunosensing 
platform that has the potential to detect multiple analytes 
simultaneously on the same substrate at sub femto gram per mL 
range. The binding event of antibody and antigen was transduced in 
terms of normalized resistance of bioelectrodes, measured through 
a four-probe probe station. By using PPY-fMWCNT as a 
bioelectrical transducer, the proposed sensing platform detected 
AB40 peptides (in real-time human plasma samples) in the linear 
detection range of 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with a very low limit of 
detection (LoD) and a high sensitivity of 0.564 fg/mL and 55.67 
((ΔR/R0)/ng.mL-1)/cm2, respectively. The sensitivity of bare PPY 
(18.44 ((ΔR/R0)/ng.mL-1)/cm2) compared 
with 
fMWCNTs 
embedded PPY sensing platform enhanced 2.02 times without 
compromising in LoD. The analytical performance of the platform 
is further evaluated in terms of selectivity, repeatability and 
interference, posing its significance in the early detection of AD."

(PANi) 
nanofibers, 
their 
characterization 
and 
use 
as 
transducers in chemiresistive DNA sensing have been reported. 
PANi, among many one-dimensional conductive polymers, has 
shown great potential as a transducer in chemiresistive 
biosensing in general and DNA sensing in particular, on account 
of its natural conductivity, ease of doping and surface 
functionalization. Herein, PANi nanofibers were synthesized 
using a seeding method, using single walled carbon nanotube 
(SWCNT) seeds. Surface morphology of the thus synthesized 
nanofibers 
were 
investigated 
using 
scanning 
electron 
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM). The nanofibers were surface modified with 2% 
glutaraldehyde for facilitating probe-DNA immobilization, and 
the results of the same were investigated using Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy. Further, towards analyzing 
the electrical transport properties of the PANi nanofibers, I-V 
characteristics were recorded in the applied bias range of -10 V 
- +10 V, using Agilent B1500A parametric analyzer. As inferred, 
the I-V response was symmetric about the vertical axis, 
revealing a crossover between near-Ohmic and power-law 
dominated regions. As a case study, in this work, the PANi 
nanofibers were used as transducers for chemiresistive detection 
of Dengue virus specific consensus primers (DENVCP)."
18,Label-Free Electrochemical Detection of DNA Hybridization: A Method for COVID-19 Diagnosis,"Abstract
This paper presents label-free electrochemical transduction as a suitable scheme for COVID-19-specific viral RNA/c-DNA 
detection, with an aim to facilitate point of care diagnosis. In lieu of this, we discuss the proposed electrochemical biosens-
ing scheme, based on electrodeposited gold nanoparticles as the transducing elements. Specific to this approach, here, the 
protocols associated with the immobilization of the single-stranded probe nucleotide on to the biosensor, have also been 
laid out. This paper also discusses the methods of electrochemical analysis, to be used for data acquisition and subsequent 
calibration, in relation to target analyte detection. Towards facilitating portable diagnosis, development of miniaturized sen-
sors and their integration with readout units have also been discussed."

18,A Step Towards Miniaturized Milk Adulteration Detection System: Smartphone-Based Accurate pH Sensing Using Electrospun Halochromic Nanofibers,"Abstract
Development of an economical miniaturized platform for monitoring inherent biophysical properties of milk is imperative for
tamper-proof milk adulteration detection. Towards this, herein, we demonstrate synthesis and evaluation of a paper-based
scalable pH sensor derived from electrospun halochromic nanofibers. The sensor manifests into three unique color-signatures
corresponding to pure (6.6 ≤pH ≤6.9), acidic (pH < 6.6), and basic (pH > 6.9) milk samples, enabling a colorimetric detection
mechanism. In a practical prototype, color transitions on the sensor strips are captured using smartphone camera and subsequent-
ly assigned to one of the three pH ranges using an image-based classifier. Specifically, we implemented three well-known
machine learning algorithms and compared their classification performances. For a standard training-to-test ratio of 80:20,
support vector machines achieved nearly perfect classification with average accuracy of 99.71%."

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among critically ill patients globally. According 
to WHO report 2018,it is estimated to affect beyond 30 million people worldwide every year.It 
causes loss of human lives, which arise from infection and inflammation and long term stay in 
intensive care unit (ICU) in hospitals. Despite the availability of satisfactory prognostic markers 
contributing to the diagnosis of sepsis, millions of people die even after admission to the 
hospitals. Correct and early diagnosis of sepsis leads to rapid administration of appropriate 
antibiotics can thus potentially avert the attainment to critical stages of sepsis, thereby saving 
human lives.Conventional diagnostic practices are costly, time consuming and they lack 
adequate sensitivity and selectivity, provoking an urgent need for developing alternate sepsis 
diagnosis systems. Nevertheless, biosensors have the much-treasured scope for reasonable sepsis 
diagnosis. Advancement in nano-biotechnology has provided new paradigm for biosensor

realizing the carbon ﬁlms, as opposed to the conventional means of sputtering. Additionally, use of the photoresist allows
us to preferably pattern the carbon ﬁlm to develop heterojunction devices of varying shape and surface area. In this
study, we have explored the NH3 sensing properties of an unpatterned a-C ﬁlm based heterojunction, where change in
the capacitance–frequency (C–f) response of the heterojunction upon adsorption of NH3 molecules on to the a-C surface
is used as the transduction principle. The sensor accounts for a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.26 ppm, a response time of
5–10 s, a postexposure recovery time of 3–5 min, and excellent selectivity, in addition to facilitating room-temperature gas

19,,"ABSTRACT
Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films offer advantages in microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) including large motion, lower drive
voltage, and high energy densities. Depending on the application, different substrates are sometimes required. Self-heating occurs in the
PZT MEMS due to the energy loss from domain wall motion, which can degrade the device performance and reliability. In this work, the
self-heating of PZT thin films on Si and glass and a film released from a substrate were investigated to understand the effect of substrates on
the device temperature rise. Nano-particle assisted Raman thermometry was employed to quantify the operational temperature rise of these
PZT actuators. The results were validated using a finite element thermal model, where the volumetric heat generation was experimentally
determined from the hysteresis loss. While the volumetric heat generation of the PZT films on different substrates was similar, the PZT
films on the Si substrate showed a minimal temperature rise due to the effective heat dissipation through the high thermal conductivity sub-
strate. The temperature rise on the released structure is 6.8× higher than that on the glass substrates due to the absence of vertical heat dissi-
pation. The experimental and modeling results show that the thin layer of residual Si remaining after etching plays a crucial role in
mitigating the effect of device self-heating. The outcomes of this study suggest that high thermal conductivity passive elastic layers can be
used as an effective thermal management solution for PZT-based MEMS actuators.

19,The Pennsylvania State University,"ABSTRACT 
This thesis focuses on the exploration of released PZT thin films, from the fundamentals 
that govern the magnitude of the piezoelectric response to applications. Quantitative measurement 
of the effective longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of partially released PZT thin films was 
conducted to provide a better understanding of declamping from the substrate. Partially released 
structures were employed in the development and optimization of piezoelectric micromachined 
ultrasound transducers (PMUT) phased arrays tailored for neuromodulation applications. Further 
steps in developing piezoelectric devices for neuromodulation applications involved investigating 
the PZT PMUT with a fully released structure to offer feasibility in flexible and conformable 
applications such as implantable ultrasound stimulation. 
The investigation of partially released PZT thin films was realized using the double beam 
laser interferometry technique to suppress the effect of substrate bending; such bending commonly 
inflates the values inferred from single beam laser interferometry. The partially released structures 
with 2 mol% Nb-doped Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 thin film were fabricated using a two-step backside 
etching process with ZnO serving as both a sacrificial layer and the silicon deep reactive ion etch 
stop layer. This fabrication approach allowed the released boundary to be well-defined and 
provided a laser path for backside probing. Significant improvement in the effective longitudinal 
piezoelectric coefficient (��33,��

) was observed in the partially released structure, with the released 
structures exhibiting a 3-fold increase in ��33,��
∗
 compared to clamped samples, reaching values of 
420 ± 8 pm/V in the 75% released structure. This enhancement is attributed to the change in stress 
level, the reduction in mechanical constraints, and improved domain wall mobility in the released 
structures. The results confirm that substrate declamping can substantially elevate the piezoelectric 
performance of thin films, bringing them closer to that of bulk ceramics.

19,Exceptional high temperature retention inAl0.93B0.07N films,"Abstract:  
This paper reports the retention behavior for Al0.93B0.07N thin films, a member of the novel 
family of wurtzite ferroelectrics. Our experiments suggest that bipolar cycling of metal 
(Pt/W)/Al0.93B0.07N/W/Al2O3 film stacks first induced wake-up, then a region of constant 
switchable polarization.  The films showed excellent retention of the stored polarization state. As 
expected, data retention was slightly inferior in the opposite state (OS) measurements. However, 
it is noted that even after 3.6×106 sec (1000 hr.). at 200°C, the OS signal margin still exceeded 200 
C/cm2. The predicted OS retention is 82% after 10 years baking at 200oC. 
 
Ferroelectric thin films are appealing for non-volatile memories due to the potential for 
short access times, long-term data storage, large noise margins, and high energy efficiency. It has 
been shown recently that Al1-xScxN,1,2,3 Al1-xBxN,4,5 AlN6 and Zn1-xMgxO7 films with the wurtzite 
crystal structure are all ferroelectric with large switchable polarization that remain stable to high 
temperatures (the material remains polar to at least 1000°C).8  This combination of properties is 
potentially advantageous for ferroelectric random-access memories. However, when developing 
any new material for ferroelectric memory, understanding the stability of the domain state and the 
number of times that the polarization can be reversed without loss of switchable polarization is 
imperative. This paper addresses these factors for a new family of ferroelectrics with the wurtzite 
structure. 
Retention, which quantifies the ability of a ferroelectric to retain the stored polarization 
state, is a critical property for non-volatile memories. Loss of data can occur due to aging of the 
written state, or to the progressive development of global or local imprint.9,10  Any factor that 
produces a local change in the stability of the domain state, including injected charges, 11 
asymmetric electrodes, strain, 12  grain boundaries, 13 , 14  thermodynamically favored domain 
orientations15, or defects16,17 can change the retention characteristics. Retention is quantified in 
terms of both same state and opposite state retention; typically, the usable polarization drops 
linearly with the logarithm of wait time. In the case of sputtered PZT films, same state retention 
characteristics tend to be more stable than opposite state retention, due to imprinting of the stored 
state.18 Data loss accelerates as the temperature is increased during the wait time between read and 
write due to thermal activation of the depolarization. Rodriguez et al. reported that in integrated 
memories with 70 nm PZT films as the storage element, the activation energy associated with

polarization loss was 0.28 eV.19 Furthermore, the retention did not change substantively, even after 
1012 switching cycles. Likewise, long-term data retention has been reported for epitaxial 
Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films.20,21 Data of this type is essential to viable memory devices. 
Data retention loss is largely unreported in nitride wurtzite ferroelectrics. Therefore, this 
paper discusses the mechanisms for polarization loss due to temperature exposure. The first 
generation of these films showed robust information retention in both same state and opposite 
state, even up to 200°C.  
Al0.93B0.07N films were grown on W/Al2O3 substrates, as described elsewhere.4 In brief, 
films of approximately 300 nm thickness were reactively sputtered using Al (pulsed DC power 
supply) and B (RF power supply) targets. The Pt top electrodes were patterned and deposited by 
DC sputtering through litho-graphic lift-off processing. To avoid possible oxidation of the films, 
no post processing treatment (e.g. post annealing) was applied. 
The same state and opposite state retention were then measured as described by Yoon et 
al.22, using a Radiant Technologies Precision Multiferroic Analyzer, with 1 ms pulse width, 10 ms 
pulse delay, and an electric field of 5-6 MV/cm. Schematics of the voltage profiles employed are

19,Domain wall motion across microstructural features in polycrystalline ferroelectric films,"Abstract 
This paper describes the effect of microstructural features such as grain boundaries and triple 
points on the pinning of domain wall motion in perovskite Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) films on 
polycrystalline SrRuO3/SrTiO3 substrates. Spatial variability in the collective domain wall 
dynamics was assessed using non-linearity mapping via Band Excitation Piezoresponse Force 
Microscopy (BE-PFM). Collocating the non-linearity maps with triple point locations (as 
visualized by EBSD) allowed for exploration of the effects that local microstructure (e.g., grain 
boundary) have on domain wall motion. It was found that the extrinsic behavior varied with both 
the misorientation angle and the proximity to the grain boundary. The width of influence of 
individual grain boundaries on the motion of domain walls was a function of the character of the 
grain boundary; random grain boundaries exhibit deeper minima in αd/d33,initial and larger widths 
of influence  (up to 905 nm) compared to coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries (up to 572 nm). 
Additionally, triple points containing larger numbers of random boundaries exhibited non-
Rayleigh behavior to greater distances, suggesting that the triple point provides either a deep 
potential minimum or a region where domain wall motion is unfavorable."

underwent dielectric breakdown.  For unpatterned first generation Al0.93B0.07N films with 100 nm 
thick Pt top electrodes survive ~104 bipolar cycles, whereas films with 1000 nm W top electrodes 
survive ~105 cycles before thermal dielectric breakdown. Sentaurus modeling was used to design 
an SU8 field plate which improved the performance to ~106 fatigue cycles. It was found that the 
thermal failures during fatigue were not due to surface flashover events but were associated with 
hard breakdown events in the dielectric. The films showed excellent retention of the stored 
polarization state. As expected, data retention was slightly inferior in the opposite state (OS) 
measurements. However, it is noted that even after 3.6×106 sec (1000 hr). at 200°C, the OS signal

19,,"ABSTRACT
When utilizing double-beam laser interferometry to assess the piezoelectric coefficient of a film on a substrate, probing both top and
bottom sample surfaces is expected to correct the erroneous bending contribution by canceling the additional path length from the sample
height change. However, when the bending deformation becomes extensive and uncontrolled, as in the case of membranes or fully released
piezoelectric films, the double-beam setup can no longer account for the artifacts, thus resulting in inflated film displacement data and
implausibly large piezoelectric coefficient values. This work serves to identify these challenges by demonstrating d33,f measurements of fully
released PZT films using a commercial double-beam laser interferometer. For a 1 μm thick randomly oriented PZT film on a 10 μm thick
polyimide substrate, a large apparent d33,f of 9500 pm/V was measured. The source of error was presumably a distorted interference pattern
due to the erroneous phase shift of the measurement laser beam caused by extensive deformation of the released sample structure. This
effect has unfortunately been mistaken as enhanced piezoelectric responses by some reports in the literature. Finite element models demon-
strate that bending, laser beam alignment, and the offset between the support structure and the electrode under test have a strong influence
on the apparent film d33,f.

This manuscript reports the temperature dependence of ferroelectric switching in Al0.84Sc0.16N, Al0.93B0.07N, and AlN thin ﬁlms. Polarization
reversal is demonstrated in all compositions and is strongly temperature dependent. Between room temperature and 300 C, the coercive
ﬁeld drops by almost 50% in all samples, while there was very small temperature dependence of the remanent polarization value. Over this
same temperature range, the relative permittivity increased between 5% and 10%. Polarization reversal was conﬁrmed by piezoelectric
coefﬁcient analysis and chemical etching. Applying intrinsic/homogeneous switching models produces nonphysical ﬁts, while models based
on thermal activation suggest that switching is regulated by a distribution of pinning sites or nucleation barriers with an average activation

Advancing modern chipsets toward non-von Neumann architec-
tures demands new materials that directly enable in-memory comput-
ing, where memory and processing units are collocated, and
limitations associated with data transfer between components are
eliminated.1 Ferroelectric materials are uniquely situated for this task,
in particular, to function as efﬁcient synaptic weights in neuromorphic
computing systems given their switchable spontaneous polarization
and potential for partial polarization reversal, allowing for nonvolatile
multilevel memory storage.2 Currently, integrated ferroelectrics are
challenged by silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconduc-
tor (CMOS) incompatibility, high processing temperatures, and prob-
lems with aggressive vertical and lateral scaling.3 With the discovery of
ferroelectric switching in HfO2, some issues with conventional perov-
skite ferroelectrics have been addressed, though high annealing tem-
peratures are sometimes required to stabilize the ferroelectric phase.4
To date, a nano-scale challenge intimately blocking scaled ferroelec-
trics in mainstream semiconductor platforms remains that may
require new material opportunities to sunder.

cive ﬁeld prevented polarization saturation in ﬁlms thinner than

in thin Al1-xScxN ﬁlms; low temperature and fast, pulsed measure-
ments have been investigated as methods to reduce leakage contribu-
tions to polarization measurements.8–11 Thin ﬁlms of boron doped
AlN also display ferroelectricity with as little as 2 mol. % BN while
maintaining a bandgap 4.9 eV for concentrations up to 20% BN,
potentially offering improved high ﬁeld leakage performance com-
pared with Al1-xScxN.12 The resulting ﬁlms are of considerable interest
for nonvolatile memory in nanoscale electronics, particularly consider-
ing their facile and compatible processing windows. However, the
manner in which their switching properties are inﬂuenced by tempera-
ture, strain, and service history requires thorough investigation. The
present manuscript explores temperature dependent switching in B-
and Sc-substituted ferroelectric AlN. The strong dependence is likely
an important means to engineer compatibility of these exciting new
materials with the nano-scale formfactors and low operating voltages
that are needed for implementation (e.g., the self-heating of the pro-
cessor during operation will raise the local temperature).

Modeling results suggest that the ferroelectricity arises from
some combination of (Al,Sc)N4 polyhedral ﬂattening perpendicular to
the polar axis and/or local structural instability associated with the
substituent.13 Structural phase competition between the wurtzite struc-
ture and the dopant’s binary nitride equilibrium structure, i.e., rock
salt for ScN and layered hexagonal for BN, softens the energy land-
scape leading to elastic softening in the polar direction.14 In Al1-xScxN,
a large reduction in c/a with the increasing Sc content accompanies a
highly tunable coercive ﬁeld, contrasting with the constant c/a ratio
and weak coercive ﬁeld dependence on B concentration in Al1-xBxN
(that is, the coercive ﬁeld drops < 1 MV/cm for B concentrations from
2 to 20 mol. %).5,12,15
To date, little is known about the temperature dependence of the
functional properties of these new ferroelectrics. In response, this
paper focuses on examining the low and high ﬁeld dielectric properties
at elevated temperatures. No evidence for phase transitions is found
between room temperature and 300 C, and the coercive ﬁeld sharply
drops with the increasing temperature, which widens the electric ﬁeld
window between switching and dielectric breakdown. These results
suggest that AlN-based ﬁlms may be attractive for high temperature
operation in order to achieve switching voltages low enough for high
efﬁciency in nonvolatile memory applications. Additionally, this work
demonstrates unambiguous partial polarization reversal in pure AlN
ﬁlms, suggesting that ferroelectricity might be a bulk material property
of AlN.
Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the relative per-
mittivity for the Al0.84Sc0.16N, Al0.93B0.07N and AlN ﬁlms. In this
work, representative ﬁlms for the AlN-ScN and AlN-BN solid solu-
tions and AlN were chosen, which were found to have good insulation
resistance at high temperatures. As expected, the relative permittivity
rises on Sc doping, with a smaller increase observed for the B-doped
ﬁlms. In each case, a slow increase is observed as a function of tempera-
ture, with no evidence of a peak in the permittivity. The temperature
coefﬁcient of the capacitance for three ﬁlms is 117, 304, and 81ppm/C,
respectively. The data for the AlN TCC are in reasonable agreement
with previous reports on the AlN single crystals of 74–79 ppm/C,
over a similar temperature range.16 Monotonic trends in dielectric
constant over this temperature range are consistent with the reports
of Fichtner et al. and Islam et al., who suggested that the ﬁlm
remained polarized (i.e., no paraelectric phase transitions) for tem-
perature excursions up to 1100 C.5,17 The loss tangent slightly
increases with temperature, which also introduces a weak frequency
dependence to the relative permittivity. These observations are con-
sistent with an increase in space charge polarizability at elevated
temperatures, as is expected for all dielectrics.18 Little hysteresis is
observed on cooling; note that in all samples, at all frequencies and
temperatures, the maximum loss tangent is below 0.02.
High ﬁeld polarization hysteresis measurements of all ﬁlms were
collected between room temperature and 300 C. For consistency, the
maximum ﬁeld was chosen to be proportionately larger than the coer-
cive ﬁeld value; in doped ﬁlms, sufﬁcient ﬁeld was applied to reach
saturation. At all temperatures, Sc- and B-substituted AlN ﬁlms show
square hysteresis loops with large remanent polarization values
between 120–135 lC/cm2. As shown in Fig. 2 (supplementary
material, Fig. S1 shows the polarization hysteresis measurements of
the AlN ﬁlm from 100 to 300 C), the remanent polarization is nearly
constant as a function of temperature, with slight tip rounding at
saturation attributed to a growing leakage current contribution. The
most notable observation is a sharply falling coercive ﬁeld with tem-
perature for both cation-substituted ﬁlms. Measurement frequency
was minimized to approach the DC coercive ﬁeld value; for Sc- and
B-substitution, the values were 333 and 100 Hz, respectively. At lower
frequencies, DC leakage contributions obfuscated data interpretation.
The lower frequency limit in the B-case is likely associated with a
larger insulation resistance that originates from its larger bandgap, a
more favorable defect equilibrium, or a more favorable microstructure.
Figure 3 plots the measured remanent polarization and coercive
ﬁeld as a function of temperature for the three composition families.
For both cation-substituted AlN ﬁlms, the remanent polarization is
nearly independent of temperature; for pure AlN, the temperature
dependence of Pr is stronger and more complicated to interpret owing
to confounding factors. At equivalent temperatures, the coercive ﬁeld
of AlN is larger than its substituent counterparts; thus, leakage cur-
rents are larger and challenge the ability to isolate charge from switch-
ing alone. Thus, these data show partial switching of the AlN ﬁlm.
Consequently, at this time, strong statements regarding Pr vs T are not
possible, but the present values are within 40% of those recently pre-
dicted for AlN.19
Therefore, a persistent and supportable trend is present for all
three families and the coercive ﬁeld is strongly temperature dependent.

20,Prediction of wireless sensor battery life,"Abstract— Most of the Wireless sensors today are 
powered using lithium batteries. The need to detect 
the end of life for these batteries has increased in 
the recent past due to a large manufacturing 
variation between suppliers and storing practices. 
It has become a challenge to explore the ways to 
access the health of these batteries in field due to 
the difficulty in measuring the internal state 
variables of the battery and also due to its 
inaccessibility. Failures of batteries in the field not 
only 
result 
in 
inconvenience 
and 
reduced 
availability of the wireless sensor, but also risk 
catastrophic 
consequences 
due 
to 
the 
unavailability of sensors to detect the anomaly. As 
a result, the current research work focuses on 
evaluating the battery end of life through a 
laboratory testing that could reproduce the field 
environment. Using the measured state variables 
an attempt is made to predict the battery health 
before it is introduced to the field. The research 
also entails developing a bulk capacitance system 
that can act as secondary charge storage to help 
increase the primary battery life during peak 
current draw. Using a tree based classifier a 
prediction methodology is developed considering 
both the battery and bulk capacitance parameters 
to estimate the overall battery health or end of life."
21,Climate Dynamics (2023) 61:3737–3754,"Abstract
Previous studies suggest that the winter surface freshening in the southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) contributes to the 
development of very high Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) thereby influencing the following summer monsoon onset. 
Here, we use forced and coupled simulations with a regional ocean general circulation model to explore the SEAS Sea 
Surface Salinity (SSS) variability mechanisms and impact on the monsoon. Both configurations capture the main SEAS 
oceanographic features, and confirm that the winter SSS decrease results from horizontal advection of Bay of Bengal 
freshwater by the cyclonic circulation around India during fall. A coupled model sensitivity experiment where salinity has 
no effect on mixing indicates that the salinity stratification reduces the SEAS mixed layer cooling by vertical processes 
by 3 °C seasonally. Salinity however enhances mixed layer cooling by a similar amount through concentrating negative 
winter surface heat fluxes into a thinner mixed layer, resulting in no climatological impact on SST and summer monsoon 
rainfall. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the main driver of the winter SEAS SSS interannual variability (r ~ 0.8). 
Salty anomalies generated in the western Bay of Bengal during fall by positive IOD events are indeed transported by the 
cyclonic climatological coastal circulation, reaching the SEAS in winter. By this time, warm IOD-induced SST anomalies 
in the SEAS are already decaying, and the SEAS SSS anomalies hence do not contribute to their development. Overall, 
our model results suggest a weak climatological and interannual impact of the SEAS winter freshening on local SST and 
following monsoon onset."
21,Microsoft Word - 9841,"Abstract 
Monsoon rain and rivers bring a large freshwater input to the Northern Bay of Bengal (BoB), 
yielding low Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) after the monsoon. The resulting sharp upper-ocean salinity 
stratification is thought to influence tropical cyclones intensity and biological productivity by 
inhibiting vertical mixing. Despite recent progresses, the density of in situ data is far from sufficient 
to monitor the BoB SSS variability, even at the seasonal timescale. The advent of satellite remotely-
sensed SSS (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP) offers a unique opportunity to provide synoptic maps of the 
BoB SSS every ~8 days. Previous SMOS SSS retrievals did not perform well in the BoB. Here, we 
show that improved systematic error corrections and quality control procedures yield a much better 
performance of the new “debiased v4”CATDS level-3 SSS from SMOS (~0.8 correlation, 0.04 bias 
and 0.64 root-mean-square difference to more than 28000collocatedin situ data points over 2010-
2019). The SMOS product now performs equivalently to Aquarius, and is slightly inferior to SMAP 
over the BoB. In particular, SMAP and SMOS are able to capture salinity variations close to the east 
coast of India (r>0.8 within 75-150 km of the coast). They thus capture the seasonal freshening there, 
associated with equatorward advection of the Northern BoB low-salinity water by the EastIndian 
Coastal Current (EICC) after the summer monsoon. The10-yearlong SMOS record further allows to 
describe the BoB interannual SSS variability, which is strongest in boreal fall in relation with the 
Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).Positive IOD events induce a weakening of the southward export of 
freshwater by the EICC, and hence negative SSS anomalies in the Northern BoB and positive ones 
along the East Indian coast. This confirms results from earlier studies based on modelling, sparse in 
situ data, or shorter satellite records, but this time from a 10-year long SSS record. Overall, our study 
indicates that the new SMOS retrieval can be confidently used to monitor the BoB SSS and to study 
its mechanisms. We end by a brief description of the BoB SSS anomalies associated with the 
extreme 2019 IOD event and highlight the very good performance over the BoB of a new multi-
satellite product developed by the European Space Agency merging SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP 
data. 
Highlights 
 The new debiased CATDS SMOS SSS product resolves major issues in the Bay of Bengal 
 New SMOS has a comparable quality with SMAP and Aquarius, but over a full decade 
 Confirms the post-monsoon southward transport of low saline water by the EICC 
 Confirms that this transport is interannually modulated by the Indian Ocean Dipole"
21,"Biogeosciences, 14, 3615–3632, 2017","Abstract. The northern Arabian Sea hosts a winter chloro-
phyll bloom, triggered by convective overturning in response
to cold and dry northeasterly monsoon winds. Previous stud-
ies of interannual variations of this bloom only relied on a

associated processes. The current study aims at identifying
these processes using both ∼10 years of observations (in-

display a good phase agreement at seasonal and interannual
timescales. The model and observations both indicate that
the interannual winter bloom ﬂuctuations are strongly tied to
interannual mixed layer depth anomalies (∼0.6 to 0.7 cor-
relation), which are themselves controlled by the net heat
ﬂux at the air–sea interface. Our modelling results suggest
that the mixed layer depth control of the bloom amplitude
ensues from the modulation of nutrient entrainment into the
euphotic layer. In contrast, the model and observations both
display insigniﬁcant correlations between the bloom ampli-

depth, as suggested in a previous study.

The Bay of Bengal combines several unique features that make it an excellent laboratory to study the variability of
salinity and its potential effects on the oceanic circulation and climate. This basin receives very large quantities of
freshwater in association to the southwest monsoon, either directly from rain or indirectly through the runoffs of
the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Irrawaddy. This large quantity of freshwater in a small, semi enclosed basin results
in some of the lowest sea surface salinities (SSS) and strongest near-surface haline stratiﬁcation in the tropical
band. The strong monsoon winds also drive an energetic circulation, which exports the excess water received
during the monsoon and results in strong horizontal salinity gradients.
In this talk, I will summarize several studies of the Bay of Bengal salinity variability and its impacts undertaken
in the context of an Indo-French collaboration. In situ data collected along the coast by ﬁshermen and model
results show that the intense, coastally-trapped East India Coastal Current (EICC) transports the very fresh water
near the Ganges-Brahmaputra river mouth along the eastern Bay of Bengal rim to create a narrow, very fresh
“river in the sea” after the southwest monsoon. The salinity-induced pressure gradient contributes to almost 50%
of the EICC intensity and sustains mesoscale eddy generation through its effect on horizontal current shears and
baroclinic gradients. Oceanic eddies play a strong role in exporting this fresh water from the coast to the basin
interior. This “river in the sea” has a strong interannual variability related to the EICC remote modulation by the
Indian Ocean Dipole (a regional climate mode). I will also discuss the potential effect of haline stratiﬁcation on
the regional climate through its inﬂuence on the upper ocean budget. Finally, I will brieﬂy discuss the performance
of remote-sensing for observing SSS in the Bay of Bengal."
21,A modeling study of processes controlling the Bay of Bengal sea surface salinity interannual variability,"Abstract Recent observational studies provided preliminary insights on the interannual variability of Bay
of Bengal (BoB) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), but are limited by the poor data coverage. Here, we describe the
BoB interannual SSS variability and its driving processes from a regional eddy-permitting ocean general
circulation model forced by interannually varying air-sea ﬂuxes and altimeter-derived discharges of major
rivers over the past two decades. Simulated interannual SSS variations compare favorably with both in situ
and satellite data and are largest in boreal fall in three regions: the northern BoB, the coastal region off east
India, and the Andaman Sea. In the northern BoB, these variations are independent from those in other
regions and mostly driven by summer-fall Ganga-Brahmaputra runoff interannual variations. In fall, remote
forcing from the Indian Ocean Dipole results in anticlockwise anomalous horizontal currents that drive
interannual SSS variations of opposite polarity along the east coast of India and in the Southern Andaman
Sea. From winter onward, these anomalies are damped by vertical mixing in the northern BoB and along
the east coast of India and by horizontal advection in the Southern Andaman Sea. While river runoff
ﬂuctuations locally play a strong role near the Ganga-Brahmaputra river mouth, wind-driven interannual
current anomalies are responsible for a large fraction of SSS interannual variability in most of the basin."
21,Assessment of seasonal and year-to-year surface salinity signals retrieved from SMOS and Aquarius missions in the Bay of Bengal,"Abstract : 
 
The Bay of Bengal (BoB) exhibits a wide range of sea surface salinity (SSS), with very fresh water 
induced by heavy monsoonal precipitation and river run-offs to the north, and saltier water to the south. 
This is a particularly challenging region for the application of satellite-derived SSS measurements 
because of the potential pollution of the SSS signal by radio frequency interference (RFI) and land-
induced contamination in this semi-enclosed basin. The present study validates recent level-3 monthly 
gridded (1° × 1°) SSS products from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius missions to 
an exhaustive in situ SSS product for the BoB. Current SMOS SSS retrievals do not perform better than 
existing climatologies. This is in stark contrast to Aquarius, which outperforms SMOS and available SSS 
climatologies everywhere in the BoB. While SMOS only captures the SSS seasonal evolution in the 
northern part of the Bay, Aquarius accurately captures the seasonal signal in the entire basin. The 
Aquarius product is also able to capture SSS non-seasonal anomalies, with an approximate correlation 
(r) of 0.75 with box-averaged in situ data in the northern, central, and western parts of the Bay. Aquarius 
can, thus, be confidently used to monitor large-scale year-to-year SSS variations in the BoB.

21,A modeling study of the processes of surface salinity seasonal cycle in the Bay of Bengal,"Abstract In response to the Indian Monsoon freshwater forcing, the Bay of Bengal exhibits a very strong
seasonal cycle in sea surface salinity (SSS), especially near the mouths of the Ganges-Brahmaputra and
along the east coast of India. In this paper, we use an eddy-permitting (25 km resolution) regional ocean
general circulation model simulation to quantify the processes responsible for this SSS seasonal cycle.
Despite the absence of relaxation toward observations, the model reproduces the main features of the
observed SSS seasonal cycle, with freshest water in the northeastern Bay, particularly during and after the
monsoon. The model also displays an intense and shallow freshening signal in a narrow (100 km wide)
strip that hugs the east coast of India, from September to January, in good agreement with high-resolution
measurements along two ships of opportunity lines. The mixed layer salt budget conﬁrms that the strong
freshening in the northern Bay during the monsoon results from the Ganges-Brahmaputra river discharge
and from precipitation over the ocean. From September onward, the East India Coastal Current transports
this freshwater southward along the east coast of India, reaching the southern tip of India in November. The
surface freshening results in an enhanced vertical salinity gradient that increases salinity of the surface layer
by vertical processes. Our results reveal that the erosion of the freshwater tongue along the east coast of
India is not driven by northward horizontal advection, but by vertical processes that eventually overcome
the freshening by southward advection and restore SSS to its premonsoon values. The salinity-stratiﬁed bar-
rier layer hence only acts as a ‘‘barrier’’ for vertical heat ﬂuxes, but is associated with intense vertical salt
ﬂuxes in the Bay of Bengal."

22,Wide Band Beam Steering Digital Metasurface Reflectarray Antenna for Millimeter Wave Applications,"ABSTRACT A compact wideband digital metasurface reflectarray antenna for millimeter-wave application
is presented in this article. The metasurface reflectarray is composed of periodic arrangements of metabit
unit cell elements. The metabit consists of a dipole with end stub loading, exhibiting wideband reflection
characteristics. The metabit is quantized to generate two discrete reflection phase levels, resulting in binary
states of 0 and 1, respectively. The binary bits are distributed over the reflector surface using uniform phase
quantization to achieve a highly directive beam in the desired direction. A digital metasurface reflector
array composed of 20 × 20 metabits is analyzed, fabricated, and characterized. The digital reflector is
illuminated by a Ka-band horn antenna placed at a miniaturized focal point, resulting in compactness with
high gain. The specialized digital coding sequence on the reflector surface results in a highly directive
beam towards 0◦, ±15◦, and ±30◦operating in the frequency band of 26 GHz - 35 GHz with a maximum
achievable gain of 2"
22,Compact Self-Isolated Extremely Low ECC Folded-SIW-Based Slot MIMO Antenna for 5G Application,"Abstract—This letter proposes a compact, self-isolated extremely
low correlated, 1×4 folded-SIW-based slot antenna conﬁguration
for a 5G multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) communication
system operating at 38 GHz band. To minimize the near-ﬁeld
coupling between the feed lines and ensure impedance matching
at the microstrip (MS) to T-type folded substrate integrated wave-
guide feeding (TFSIW) section, the capacitive and longitudinal
currents at the input section of the TFSIW are precisely tuned by
adjusting the position of lateral walls and optimizing the dimension
of the central wall and septum. The compactness of this antenna is
attained through the utilization of a TFSIW, which possesses a high
compression ratio resulting in a total MIMO size of 9.8 × 38.64 ×
0.508 mm3. The self-isolated MIMO antenna offers an impedance
bandwidth of 7.17% (36.5–39.28 GHz), a maximum gain of 10 dBi,
minimum isolation of 30 dB. The envelope correlation coefﬁcient
(ECC) remains below 3 × 10−5, whereas the diversity gain (DG)
exceeds 9.99993 dB. The radiation efﬁciency remains over 90%, the
minimum cross-pol difference (XPD) is 20 dB, maximum side lobe
level (SLL) remains around −15 dB in the XZ-plane. The measured
results closely match the simulated one. Furthermore, the proposed
design demonstrates enhanced performance and higher compact-
ness when compared to the recent and limited state-of-the-art
works.

cells of size 0.28 λ0 × 0.28 λ0 (where λ0 is free-space wavelength at

22,A BBL-Net based OFDM Signal Detection in the Presence of RF Impairments,"Abstract—Channel estimation is an essential technology for
any multi-carrier modulation (MCM) framework. Traditionally,
least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE)
estimators are used based on the availability of channel state
information (CSI). However, in the presence of radio frequency
(RF) impairments, i.e., carrier frequency offset (CFO) and
phase offset(PO), the statistical models lose their optimality.
This paper proposes a batch normalized Bi-directional long
short memory network (BBL-Net) based joint channel estimation
and signal detection approach for orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) system in the presence of CFO and
PO at the receiver. A combination of experiments has been
conducted to find the optimum activation function for the BBL-
Net architecture. Simulation results show that the trained model
can recall and predict the information efficiently even in high
interference scenarios and also provide robust performance in
lower pilot numbers."

5G cellular handsets / base-stations operating at n78 (3.3-3.6 GHz)

oblique angle of incidence of upto 60º. To achieve focused beam in 
the broadside direction antenna configuration with DMSL-1 is 
adopted which is constructed using an array of 25 × 25 meta-
atoms. The maximum gain of 19.5 dBi is achieved for DMSL-1 
antenna configuration in the broadside direction showing a gain 
enhancement of 13.4 dB. Further, the antenna with DMSL-2 is 
designed to split and focus the beams simultaneously in ±30º 
direction resulting in two equal beams each having a gain of 16.6 
dBi and a gain enhancement of 10.5 dB. The f/D ratio for both

22,Digital Metasurface Reflectarray Antenna for 5G Millimeter Wave Applications,"Abstract— A high gain digital metasurface reflectarray 
antenna for 5G applications is proposed using a single layered one 
bit digital metamaterial unit cell. The unit cell is a split square with 
a pair of metallic strips connecting the outer ring. The unit cell 
provides the two quantized phase states with 180 phase shift and 
low insertion loss resulting in one bit digital phase profile. This one 
bit digital phase distribution is employed to design a 9.7��×

reflect array is centrally feed by the source antipodal Vivaldi 
antenna to design high gain digital metasurface reflector array 
antenna. The designed reflect array antenna achieves a broadside

less than -18 dBi respectively.

This article investigates the designing of tunable laterally and orthogonally placed MIMO 
antennas with enhanced isolation for THz applications. The tunability is achieved by vary-
ing the chemical potential of trapezoidal graphene-based patches loaded over the metallic 
patch antennas. Mutual coupling between the laterally placed MIMO antennas is mitigated 
by the use of defected ground structures. In the first design, a cross-shaped stub emanat-
ing out from a square shaped slot has been introduced in the ground plane for improv-
ing the isolation between the unloaded antennas without degradation of their impedance 
bandwidth."
22,"A Low Cost, Mm wave Waveguide-To-Strip line Transition For 5G Applications","Abstract—In millimeter-wave systems, a waveguide to strip-

RFICs and other components. This manuscript presents a novel 
low-cost, mm-Wave waveguide-to-strip line transition using a

22,Millimeter Wave Metasurface Lens for Gain Enhancement,"Abstract— Design of Metasurface (MS) lens operating at 
28 GHz frequency is proposed in this work for gain 
enhancement with focused beam in broadside direction. The 
transmission type MS lens consists of Huygens’ unit cell 
arranged in a 15 × 15 matrix in order to provide phase 
compensation to the incidenting phase profile from the feed. 
The unit cell provides more than 360° transmission phase 
coverage with a single dielectric substrate layer. The overall 
antenna system consists of a feed horn and a planar MS lens 
with hyperbolic phase profile. The size of the lens is 7.28 λ0 × 
7.28 λ0 × 0.14 λ0 (where, λ0 is free space wavelength at 
operating frequency i.e. 28 GHz). The proposed MS lens 
improves the gain of Ka-band pyramidal horn by 8.4 dB, 
resulting in a broadside gain of 23.40 dBi. This short focus 
high gain antenna system can be used for various 5G 
applications."
22,Design of Ultrathin Metasurface Lens for Gain Enhancement of Microstrip Patch Antenna,"Abstract—In this paper, gain enhancement of microwave 
radiator by using ultra thin compact metasurface lens is 
proposed. An ultrathin transmission type metasurface of 
thickness 0.012 λ with 3 dB transmission band of about 1 GHz 
with centre resonant frequency of 5.10 GHz is designed first. 
Next, a lens antenna is designed by placing the metasurface on 
the top of microstrip patch antenna radiator at an optimum focal 
length. The metasurface placed over microwave radiator causes 
convergence of radiated beam. The operating bandwidth of 
proposed lens antenna is 0.20 GHz from 5.00 GHz to 5.20 GHz.  
A measured broad side gain enhancement of about 3.75 dB is 
achieved at centre resonant frequency 5.10 GHz resulting in 
enhancement of aperture efficiency and directivity. The 
simulated and measured results are in good agreement."

and beam steering. The array is composed of unit cells having
a periodicity of 0.23λ0 x 0.23λ0 . The quantized unit cells
are highly reﬂective with the reﬂection coefﬁcient amplitude
greater than 0.95. A phase difference of 1800 is obtained at
desired operating frequency. The designed array achieves a
broadside gain of 2"
22,Anisotropic Magnetic Media for Antenna Gain Enhancement,"Abstract—This paper presents a gain enhancement 
technique for millimeter wave antennas. The theory and 
mechanism of magnetic anisotropy and electromagnetic 
propagation are discussed. The anisotropic magnetic media 
(AMM) provides path length compensation for different 
transverse electric (TE) waves to have propagation without any 
phase accumulation. The effect of anisotropic magnetic media 
is studied for antenna gain enhancement using a microstrip 
patch antenna. The AMM provides a gain enhancement of 
about 5.3dB when placed above the radiator, resulting in an 
aperture efficiency of 85% at 28GHz."

Abstract: In the ElectroMed project, we are interested in screening certain peptide sequences for
their ability to selectively interact with antibodies or MHC proteins. This poses a combinatorial
challenge that requires a highly multiplexed setup of label-free immunosensors. Label-free FET-based
immunosensors are good candidates due to their high multiplexing capability and fast response time.
Nanowire-based FET sensors have shown high sensitivity but are unreliable for clinical applications
due to drift and gate stability issues. To address this, a label-free immuno-FET architecture based on
planar junctionless FET devices is proposed. This geometry can improve the signal-to-noise ratio due
to its larger planar structure, which is less prone to defects that cause noise and is better suited to the
functionalization of different receptor molecules."
23,Planar Junctionless Field-Effect Transistor for Detecting Biomolecular Interactions,"Abstract: Label-free ﬁeld-effect transistor-based immunosensors are promising candidates for pro-

In this work, planar junctionless ﬁeld-effect transistor sensors (FETs) were fabricated and character-
ized for pH sensing. The device with SiO2 gate oxide has shown voltage sensitivity of 4"

growth of microorganisms. Their abuse results in various side effects on the human health, environment and 
agriculture. The occurrence of bacterial “suprainfection” with tolerance to antibiotics has attracted the signifi-
cant attention, mainly due to the consequences of multi drug resistance and potential threat to human health 
and the environment. With the increasing incidences of antimicrobial contamination, especially in food, dairy 
products, agriculture and environment, their regular monitoring is on prime interest. Aptamers are synthetic 
short sequences of single stranded (ss) oligonucleotides (ss-RNA or DNA), which are developed by an in-vit-
ro selection process known as “Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)” tech-
nique. Among the receptors available for biosensing, aptamer exhibit the advantages of high specificity, selec-
tivity, stability, facile labelling and modification, which makes them ideal candidates for development of new 
biosensing applications for detection of specific target molecules. In the present review, we concentrate on the 
recent advances in the development of aptasensors for antibiotics residue analysis based on electrochemical 
signal generation. Aptamers possesses the strong potential as receptors for the development of biosensors for 
antibiotics detection; therefore, a specially designed aptamer specific to an antibiotic may be suitable for this 
purpose. In this review, the importance of detection of antibiotic residue contamination, reported analytical 
methods, advancement in biosensing platform especially regarding electrochemical transduction are discussed 
in detail. Finally, future prospects toward the development of selective and sensitive aptasensors for antibiotic

The latest MIMC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database has rich information on over 58k patient’s medical histories for over 
11 years. Based on MIMC III database, this paper presents a study of those patient’s primary disease risk prediction modeling, which focuses on 
assessing future disease risks for an individual who is ready for discharge. We explore a framework that combines regression modeling and deep 
learning techniques to substantially improve the performance of developed models. Firstly, a regression model will be applied to predicting the 
length of stay for a patient’s future ICU visit. Secondly, deep learning approach will be adopted to assess individual’s future visit in terms of time 
and the primary disease. If the modeling gets adopted in a hospital, the predicted results can be promisingly utilized as a reference for medical 
professionals and experts to oﬀer eﬀective health care guidance for patients. The proposed framework can also be utilized for developing an 
innovative tool that helps individuals create and maintain a better healthcare plan over time.

25,An Efficient Standard Cell Design Methodology by Exploiting Body Biasing and Poly Biasing in FDSOI for NTV Regime,"Abstract-In this article, an approach for the development of
a digital standard cell library design is proposed with 28 nm
Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (FDSOI) technology for
Near Threshold Voltage (NTV) regime at multiple VD D Points.
A new
systematic sizing
approach
is proposed with
the
utilization of biasing features such as poly biasing and body
biasing related to a transistor. These features facilitate high-
energy efficiency
and optimized performance. Due
to the
excellent response with lower process variations and leakage
reduction, a 28 nm-FDSOI process node is used for this work.
The proposed standard cell library is designed by incorporating
asymmetric biasing techniques and achieved minimum process
variations while employing in ring oscillators (RO) and buffer
circuitry. The newly developed library results in 42% and 35%
of delay and energy reduction, respectively."
25,Switching Activity Factor-Based ECSM Characterization (SAFE): A Novel Technique for Aging-Aware Static Timing Analysis,"Abstract—We propose SAFE (Switching Activity Factor-based
Effective Current Source Model) for aging-aware static timing
analysis (STA), a new technique for estimating the timing
performance of digital circuits. SAFE is based on the develop-
ment of device-level variation-aware analytical timing models of
stacked and multistage logic cells (commonly employed transistor
topologies in a synthesized netlist of a random logic path),
which drastically reduces the recharacterization efforts of the
standard cells. The models developed are derived as a function
of input transition time (TR) and load capacitance (CL). The
timing performance of a standard cell degrades with threshold
voltage (Vth) degradation in a MOS device due to various aging
mechanisms. SAFE, makes the entire STA process aging aware
by updating its model coefficients with Vth degradation caused
by aging. It is achieved by proposing a method for estimating
Vth degradation under various stress conditions, including static,
dynamic, and asymmetric, that applies to any process design
kit (PDK). To consider asymmetric aging, we have developed a
method to find effective switching activity factor (αeff) for N-stage
stacked and N-stage parallel logic which is used to find the value
of switching activity factor (α) at intermediate nodes in pipelined
logic circuits. Our simulations are performed in Mentor Graphics
Eldo SPICE environment using STMicroelectronics 28 nm and
65 nm CMOS process. The proposed technique provides a high
simulation accuracy (2.5% average error) when compared with
SPICE simulations. Finally, we achieved a ∼98.14% reduction in
the required number of simulations using SAFE when compared
with a completely SPICE/Aging simulation-based approach."
25,Beyond SPICE Simulation: A Novel Variability-Aware STA Methodology for Digital Timing Closure,"Abstract— This article proposes a method for performing device-
level variability-aware static timing analysis (STA) on digital 
circuits using a tool flow methodology based on Python and Bash 
scripting. The method involves creating an effective current 
source model (ECSM) .libs file with a custom tool flow, which 
incorporates variation-aware timing models of standard cells to 
minimize recharacterization efforts. The resulting file is 
integrated into an industry-standard STA tool environment to 
assess the impact of device and layout level variability on digital 
timing closure. The simulation work is carried out using Mentor 
Graphics ELDO SPICE, Synopsys DC Compiler, and PrimeTime 
STA environment in STMicroelectronics (STM) 65 nm CMOS 
process. This tool flow reduces recharacterization efforts by 
98.13% compared to conventional SPICE simulation by 
incorporating the impact of device-level variability on the 
conventional STA flow."
25,Aging-Aware Timing Model of CMOS Inverter: Path Level Timing Performance and Its Impact on the Logical Effort,"Abstract—A static timing analysis (STA) methodology based
on an effective current source model (ECSM) is proposed for
the ﬁrst time for estimating the aging-aware path-level timing
performance and its impact on the logical effort of a CMOS
inverter for digital timing closure in pre-stress and post-stress
conditions. Degradation in the threshold voltage (Vth) of PMOS
occurs due to temporal variability mechanisms (aging), such as
negative bias temperature instability, resulting in delay degra-
dation of a standard cell. Therefore, we proposed a technique
to make the STA process aware of this degradation by devel-
oping device-level variation aware (with aging) timing models of
CMOS inverters to represent threshold-crossing points (TCPs) in
an ECSM.libs ﬁle as a function of stress time (t). A device-level
approach for Vth degradation into different aging conditions,
such as static and dynamic, is developed for a given process design
kit to update TCPs in a (.libs) ﬁle as a function of t. A python-
based tool is being developed to estimate the path-level timing
performance of digital circuits in pre- and post-stress conditions.
Again, we developed a technique for relating the inverter’s logical
effort with t to resize a near-critical path in pre-stress conditions
for achieving digital timing closure in pre- and post-stress con-
ditions. The veriﬁcation and validation of the proposed model
with different benchmark circuits are performed using a para-
sitic extracted netlist in the Eldo SPICE environment with the
65-nm CMOS process technology. Finally, our model reduces the
number of SPICE/Stress simulations by 98.13% compared to the
previously reported only simulation-based techniques."
25,Significance of Organic Ferroelectric in Harnessing Transient Negative Capacitance Effect at Low Voltage Over Oxide Ferroelectric,"Abstract—The concept of leveraging the transient negative 
capacitance (TNC) effect in a ferroelectric (FE) is a relatively 
new addition to the field of nanoelectronics. Until now, there has 
been no comparison of organic and oxide FE-based metal-FE-
metal (MFM) devices in harnessing the TNC effect. As a result, 
we introduce an external resistor-MFM (R-MFM) series circuit 
to investigate the role of organic and oxide FEs in harnessing the 
TNC effect at low supply voltages. The multidomain Ginzburg-
Landau-Khalatnikov theory is used to model the FE materials 
in a technology computer-aided design environment. We show 
that: (i) organic FE-based R-MFM series circuit can harness the 
TNC effect at just 1 V whereas an oxide FE-based R-MFM series 
circuit cannot; (ii) the coercivity of an organic FE is 77.39% 
lower than its counterpart, oxide FE; (iii) the remanent 
polarization of an organic MFM ("
25,Post-CMOS Devices: Landau&#x2019;s Anisotropy Sensitivity Analyses for Organic Ferroelectric Gate Stack and Its Application to NCTFET,"Abstract—This study aims to offer a generic simulation 
framework for metal/organic ferroelectric/metal (M/OFE/M) 
devices using Ginzburg-Landau-Khalatnikov (GLK) model for 
post-CMOS ultralow voltage applications. The M/OFE/M 
device with and without the external resistor (R) is simulated 
within the Synopsys© technology computer-aided design 
(TCAD) environment. The OFE material poly(vinylidene 
fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] is modeled as an 
ad-hoc OFE material in the TCAD material library because it is 
not yet included in the standard TCAD material library. The 
significance of the GLK model in harnessing the negative 
capacitance (NC) effect at an ultralow voltage (VG = 0.5 V) over 
the conventional Preisach model is discussed briefly. Moreover, 
the sensitivity analyses on quasistatic and non-quasistatic 
M/OFE/M devices with 10 nm OFE to the anisotropy constants, 
switching resistivity, and OFE thickness within 10% to 20% of 
the benchmark values are investigated. Our simulation findings 
show that: P(VDF-TrFE)’s coercivity is reduced by 84.89% with 
respect to its HfZrO counterpart; the speed of the occurrence of 
the NC effect is closely related to the input signal rising time and 
switching resistivity offered by the OFE; the total switched 
charge density of the proposed M/OFE/M is almost comparable 
to the channel charge density of a CMOS transistor. Finally, this 
study suggests an OFE-NC tunnel field-effect transistor as a 
potential post-CMOS transistor with a minimum subthreshold 
swing of 14.17 mV/decade, which is significantly steeper than the 
fundamental thermionic constraint of 60 mV/decade in CMOS."
25,Received 17 February 2022; revised 30 March 2022; accepted 29 April 2022.,"ABSTRACT
A novel approach to overcome Boltzmann’s tyranny is to exploit the negative capacitance (NC)
effect found naturally in many ferroelectric (FE) materials. We apply a set of coupled equations based on
electrostatics, Kirchoff’s law, and a well-calibrated Ginzburg-Landau-Khalatnikov technology computer-
aided design (TCAD) model to simulate an organic FE poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-co-triﬂuoroethylene)
[P(VDF-TrFE)]-based resistor metal-FE-metal (R-MFM) series circuit and a Landau transistor (LT) exhibit-
ing sub-60 mV/decade subthreshold swing (SS). TCAD simulation parameters for P(VDF-TrFE) are derived
from the reported experimental polarization versus voltage characteristics using Landau theory. Unlike oxide
FEs, the P(VDF-TrFE)-based R-MFM series circuit can exploit the NC effect at a lower supply voltage
(VG) of ±0.5 V with little energy dissipation of ∼2.7 fJ through R. Our simulation results show an 84.89%
reduction in the P(VDF-TrFE)’s coercivity concerning the oxide FE. We show that the underlying mechanism
of the NC effect is directly related to FE polarization (FE-P) switching. The NC effect occurs only when the
FE-P is in the negative curvature of the P(VDF-TrFE)’s free energy landscape. The NC effect is explored in
terms of VG, FE thickness, domain variations, R, and dipole switching resistivity. The inﬂuence of R variation
on the NC time (δt) is investigated at 100 kHz. We can observe that δt and R have a linear relationship. As R
approaches zero, we determined that the inherent FE-P switching speed exclusively restricts the NC effect.
Finally, a 32 nm P(VDF-TrFE) LT provides a minimal SS of 23.39 mV/decade, 74.92% less than its CMOS
counterpart. Therefore, the proposed organic MFM stack could open the path for developing beyond CMOS
transistor technology operating in sub-60 mV/decade."
25,Origin of Negative Capacitance Transient in Ultrascaled Multidomain Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal Stack and Hysteresis-Free Landau Transistor,"Abstract— Harnessing the negative capacitance tran-
sient (NCT) in ferroelectric (FE) materials is a relatively new
concept in nanoelectronics. In this article, a set of coupled
equations based on Kirchhoff’s law, electrostatics, and an
experimentally validated multidomain Landau–Khalatnikov
(MD-LK) equation is used to simulate poly(vinylidene
ﬂuoride-co-triﬂuoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)]-based resistor-
metal-FE-metal (R-MFM) series circuit in Synopsys technol-
ogy computer-aided design. We show that the proposed
MD MFM stack’s coercivity is reduced by 80.36%–89% con-
cerning different oxide FEs. Unlike oxide FE-based gate
stacks, the P(VDF-TrFE)-based R-MFM series circuit can
exploit the NCT effect at lower supply voltages (VIN = 0.5 V),
with only 0.14 fJ of energy usage. We show that NCT in
an R-MFM series circuit originates from the mismatch in
switching rate between the metal electrodefree charge (QFE)
and the polarization (P) in MD MFM during switching. The
NC region of the FE thermodynamic energy proﬁle causes
the transient mismatch between QFE and P. Furthermore,
it is validated using a bipolar to unipolar pulsing technique,
which conﬁrms that the underlying mechanism of NCT is
directly related to P switching and not to any extrinsic
ﬂaws in the system. The NCT response induced by the
QFE and P mismatch is justiﬁed by its dependence on R,
viscosity coefﬁcient, VIN, and the number of domains (N).

a subthreshold swing (SS) of 26.59 mV/decade, OFF-state

25,Ultrascaled Multidomain P(VDF-TrFE) Organic Ferroelectric Gate Stack to the Rescue,"Abstract—The idea of harnessing the negative capacitance 
signature (NCS) effect in a ferroelectric (FE) material is a recent 
entry in the world of nanoelectronics. There is an urgent need to 
harness this effect at a minimum supply voltage (VA). Therefore, 
in this paper, we have investigated the transient NCS response 
in a series resistor (R)-organic FE (OFE) (RCOFE) circuit at 
±0.4 V employing a well-calibrated multidomain Ginzburg-
Landau-Khalatnikov model in Sentaurus technology computer-
aided design (STCAD) environment. A remarkable average 
coercive voltage reduction of about 69 to 90.16 % is achieved 
concerning different literature reports. The proposed OFE gate 
stack (OFEGS) can capture the NCS effect even at ±0.4 V, while 
its counterpart FE hafnium dioxide (HfO2) based gate stack fails 
to harness the NCS and behaves like a positive linear capacitor. 
The various influence of the Landau parameters, R, and 
switching resistivity (ρOFE) on the transient NCS behavior are 
significantly investigated. We found that the NCS response time 
(δt) and the NCS voltage window (δVNCS) accentuate as R 
increases. The δt in the proposed OFEGS is much faster (99.77 
to ⁓99.88 %) than its state-of-the-art counterparts. Finally, our 
OFEGS can capture the maximum δVNCS by coming close to the 
ideal Landau path with a negligible deviation of about ±0.009 V 
at zero FE polarization. Therefore, the proposed device 
capturing NCS with a small VA of ±0.4 V, total switched charge 
density of 2.54 µC/cm2, and lower energy dissipation of 0.95 fJ 
could act as a rescuer for many standard transistors from the 
Boltzmann’s Tyranny."
25,Harnessing Maximum Negative Capacitance Signature Voltage Window in P(VDF-TrFE) Gate Stack,"Abstract—In this paper, the observation of transient 
negative capacitance signature (NCS) in an organic ferroelectric 
gate stack (OFEGS) at minimum supply voltage (VS) of ±0.5 V 
is investigated employing a well-calibrated Ginzburg-Landau-
Khalatnikov (GLK) model in the environment of Sentaurus 
technology computer-aided design (STCAD). We observe an 
88.62 to 94.76 % reduction in the average coercive voltage (VC) 
of the proposed OFEGS, which is still a significant challenge for 
the conventional ferroelectric (FE) lead zirconate titanate. We 
study the resistor-OFEGS (RCOFE) series network behaviors in 
response to a bipolar and unipolar triangular signal. Our 
findings prove that the presence of NCS is directly correlated 
with the FE polarization (FEP) switching and not because of any 
extrinsic defects in the system. The various impacts of VS, GLK 
parameters, R, dipole switching resistivity (ROFE) variations on 
the NCS response are investigated. The proposed OFEGS can 
harness the NCS effect at ±0.5 V with minimum energy 
dissipation of 4.81 × 10−16 J, a challenge for the oxide FE-based 
gate stacks. Calibrating R to the maximum limit, we can capture 
the S-shaped ideal Landau path where the NCS is maximum 
with a small deviation of about ±0.006 V at zero FEP. Finally, 
an OFEGS based Landau transistor is implemented, providing 
a minimum subthreshold swing (SSmin) of 38.21 mV/decade, 
which is 36.32 % lesser than the fundamental SSmin limitation of 
60 mV/decade. Therefore, the proposed OFEGS with a

(VDD) and high-frequency polarization switching in an

capacitor
(OFEC).
The
Landau–
Khalatnikov (LK) equation is used to model the organic
ferroelectric (OFE) in the Sentaurus technology computer-
aided design (TCAD) environment considering multidomain
(MD) dynamics and interaction factor (KOFE), resulting in a
strong resemblance with the reported experimental results.
The operation of OFEC at gigahertz frequency is examined
with the experimentally validated MD-LK model. We study
the impact of multiple domains in the OFEC on the transient
response considering three separate sizes of the top metal
plate (TMP). Our ﬁndings show that OFEC with a larger
TMP area charges slowly than the other OFEC with smaller
and proposed area TMP because of the enormous amount
of domains in the larger area TMP. Various effects of VDD,
external resistor (R), and LK static parameters on negative
capacitance signature (NCS) are investigated. We observe
the NCS effect at 1 V because the coercive voltage of the
OFEC is around 0.56 V, which is 73.33% lower than the
conventional ferroelectric (FE) lead zirconate titanate (PZT),
resulting in a minimum energy-delay product (EDP) of 2.7 ×
10−26 Js. We observe that as the value of KOFE increases,
the nature of domain wall switches from hard to soft, that
is, coercive voltage reduces, resulting in a smaller hys-
teresis loop. Finally, a passive voltage ampliﬁer (PVA) is
implemented which shows voltage ampliﬁcation of"

IC manufacturing technology has scaled down to smaller device dimensions. This scaling has 
a great impact on the design of digital ICs. The main objective of the IC manufacturing 
technology is to reduce area, power dissipation and delay for a very fast digital circuit. The

26,MoS2 nanoflower-Indocyanine green composite for enhanced optical imaging capabilities,"ABSTRACT
To enhance the efficiency of painless targeted nanotherapies, integrating optical imaging 
capabilities into nanoplatforms is gaining momentum. Our study presents a cost-effective 
synthesis of MoS2 nanoflower (MNF) and Indocyanine green (ICG) composites (MNF-ICG) 
using a physical method based on van der Waals interactions. MNF, prepared via the hydro­
thermal method, underwent characterization through UV-vis, FTIR, and fluorescence spectro­
scopy, while FESEM and XRD techniques were employed to analyse morphology and structural 
phase. Through electrostatic interaction, ICG was absorbed onto the MNF surface. The resulting 
MNF-ICG demonstrated exceptionally high optical absorbance across a broad NIR spectra, 
facilitating longer-wavelength photothermic imaging with increased penetration depth. In 
comparison to MNF alone, the composite significantly enhanced the photothermal imaging 
sensitivity of nanoplatforms, exhibiting notable bathochromic and hyperchromic shifts in 
fluorescence intensity. This innovative approach holds promise for advancing nanotherapeu­
tics with improved optical imaging capabilities.

26,Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon Dots Derived from Camel Milk for Mn7+ Sensing and Antiamyloid and Anticancer Activities,"ABSTRACT: Carbon dots (CDs) are promising biocompatible fluorescent
nanoparticles mainly used in bioimaging, drug delivery, sensing,
therapeutics, and various other applications. The utilization of natural
sources and green synthetic approaches is resulting in highly biocompatible
and nontoxic nanoparticles. Herein, we report an unprecedented facile and
green synthesis of highly luminescent carbon dots derived from camel milk
(CM) for sensing manganese (Mn7+) ions and for identifying the
anticancer potential and antiamyloid activity against α-synuclein amyloids.
α-Synuclein amyloid formation due to protein misfolding (genetic and
environmental factors) has gained significant attention due to its
association with Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. The as-
synthesized CM-CDs possess an average hydrodynamic diameter ranging
from 3 to 15 nm and also exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) emission
in the blue region. The CM-CDs possess good water dispersibility, stable fluorescence under different physical states, and
outstanding photostability. Moreover, the CM-CDs are validated as an efficient sensor for the detection of Mn7+ ions in DI water
and in metal ion-polluted tap water. In addition, the CM-CDs have demonstrated a very good quantum yield (QY) of 24.6% and a
limit of detection (LOD) of 0.58 μM for Mn7+ ions with no incubation time. Consequently, the exceptional properties of CM-CDs
make them highly suitable for a diverse array of biomedical applications."
26,Erythrocyte-Derived Nanoparticles with Folate Functionalization for Near Infrared Pulsed Laser-Mediated Photo-Chemotherapy of Tumors,"Abstract: Despite its common side effects and varying degrees of therapeutic success, chemotherapy
remains the gold standard method for treatment of cancer. Towards developing a new therapeutic
approach, we have engineered nanoparticles derived from erythrocytes that contain indocyanine
green as a photo-activated agent that enables near infrared photothermal heating, and doxorubicin
hydrochloride (DOX) as a chemotherapeutic drug. We hypothesize that milliseconds pulsed laser
irradiation results in rapid heating and photo-triggered release of DOX, providing a dual photo-
chemo therapeutic mechanism for tumor destruction. Additionally, the surface of the nanoparticles
is functionalized with folate to target the folate receptor-α on tumor cells to further enhance the
therapeutic efﬁcacy. Using non-contract infrared radiometry and absorption spectroscopy, we have
characterized the photothermal response and photostability of the nanoparticles to pulsed laser
irradiation. Our in vitro studies show that these nanoparticles can mediate photo-chemo killing of
SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells when activated by pulsed laser irradiation. We further demonstrate that
this dual photo-chemo therapeutic approach is effective in reducing the volume of tumor implants in
mice and elicits an apoptotic response. This treatment modality presents a promising approach in
destruction of small tumor nodules."
26,Membrane Cholesterol Enrichment of Red Blood Cell-Derived Microparticles Results in Prolonged Circulation,"Abstract
Particles fabricated from red blood cells (RBCs) can serve as vehicles for delivery of various 
biomedical cargos. Flipping of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer membrane 
leaflet normally occurs during the fabrication of such particles. PS externalization is a signal 
for phagocytic removal of the particles from circulation. Herein, we demonstrate that membrane 
cholesterol enrichment can mitigate the outward display of PS on microparticles engineered from 
RBCs. Our in-vitro results show that the phagocytic uptake of cholesterol-enriched particles by 
murine macrophages takes place at a lowered rate, resulting in reduced uptake as compared to 
RBC-derived particles without cholesterol enrichment. When administered via tail-vein injection 
into healthy mice, the percent of injected dose (ID) per gram of extracted blood for cholesterol-
enriched particles was ~"
26,Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Intraperitoneal Ovarian Tumors in Mice Using Erythrocyte-Derived Optical Nanoparticles and Spatially-Modulated Illumination,"Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer. Cytoreductive surgery to remove
primary and intraperitoneal tumor deposits remains as the standard therapeutic approach. However,
lack of an intraoperative image-guided approach to enable the visualization of all tumors can result in
incomplete cytoreduction and recurrence. We engineered nano-sized particles derived from erythro-
cytes that encapsulate the near infrared (NIR) ﬂuorochrome, indocyanine green, as potential imaging
probes for tumor visualization during cytoreductive surgery. Herein, we present the ﬁrst demonstra-
tion of the use of these nanoparticles in conjunction with spatially-modulated illumination (SMI), at
spatial frequencies in the range of 0–0.5 mm−1, to ﬂuorescently image intraperitoneal ovarian tumors
in mice. Results of our animal studies suggest that the nanoparticles accumulated at higher levels
within tumors 24 h post-intraperitoneal injection as compared to various other organs. We demon-
strate that, under the imaging speciﬁcations reported here, use of these nanoparticles in conjunction
with SMI enhances the ﬂuorescence image contrast between intraperitoneal tumors and liver, and
between intraperitoneal tumors and spleen by nearly 2.1, and 3.0 times, respectively, at the spatial
frequency of 0.2 mm−1 as compared to the contrast values at spatially-uniform (non-modulated)
illumination. These results suggest that the combination of erythrocyte-derived NIR nanoparticles
and structured illumination provides a promising approach for intraoperative ﬂuorescence imaging
of ovarian tumor nodules at enhanced contrast."

able to take advantage of the immune evasion properties of the RBC, while the addition of an optical
cargo allows the particles to be activated by light for a number of promising applications. Here, we
review some of the common fabrication methods to engineer these constructs. We also present some
of the current light-based applications with potential for clinical translation, and offer some insight
into future directions in this exciting ﬁeld."
26,Virus-Mimicking Nanoparticles for Targeted Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Intraperitoneal Ovarian Tumors in Mice,"Abstract—Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignancy
affecting the female reproductive system. Identiﬁcation and
removal of all ovarian intraperitoneal tumor deposits during
the intraoperative surgery is important towards preventing
cancer recurrence and ultimately improving patient survival.
Herein, we investigate the effectiveness of virus mimicking
nanoparticles, derived from genome-depleted plant-infecting
brome mosaic virus, and doped with near infrared (NIR)
brominated cyanine dye BrCy106-NHS, for targeted NIR
ﬂuorescence imaging of intraperitoneal ovarian tumors. We
refer to these nanoparticles as optical viral ghosts (OVGs).
We functionalized the OVGs with antibodies against HER2
receptor, a biomarker over-expressed in ovarian cancers. We
injected functionalized OVGs, non-functionalized OVGs,
and non-encapsulated BrCy106-NHS intravenously in mice
implanted with ovarian intraperitoneal tumors. Tumors were
extracted at 2, 6, and 24 h post-injection, and quantitatively
analyzed using NIR ﬂuorescence imaging. Fluorescence
emission from tumors associated with the injection of the
functionalized OVGs continued to increase between 2 and 24
h post-injection. At 24 h timepoint, the average spectrally-
integrated ﬂuorescence emission from homogenized tumors
containing functionalized-OVGs was about 3.5 and 19.5
times higher than those containing non-functionalized OVGs
or non-encapsulated BrCy106-NHS, respectively. Similarly,
by using the functionalized-OVGs, the imaging signal-to-
noise ratio at 24 h timepoint was enhanced by approximately
threefold and sevenfold as compared to non-functionalized
OVGs and the non-encapsulated dye, respectively. These
functionalized virus-mimicking NIR nano-constructs could
potentially be used for intraoperative visualization of ovarian
tumors implants."
26,"Design, synthesis, molecular docking and cytotoxic activity of novel urea derivatives of 2-amino-3-carbomethoxythiophene","Abstract.
An efﬁcient feasible route for the one-pot synthesis of novel series of urea derivatives (2a–2j)
from 2-amino-3-carbomethoxythiophene (1) via in situ isocyanate has been developed, and their corre-
sponding anticancer activities were accomplished. The series of urea derivatives were characterized by using
1H, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopic analysis. The cytotoxic activities were evaluated
against human cervical (HeLa) and human lung (NCI-H23) cancer cell lines. These studies revealed satis-
factory activity for some of the compounds, which could potentially serve as lead compounds for drug
discovery and development. Furthermore, molecular docking studies supported in identifying the potential
binding sites between the urea derivatives and eukaryotic ribonucleotidereductase (RR). High ambiguity
driven docking (HADDOCK) modelling was speciﬁcally employed to determine the model complex of RR
and urea derivatives. The proposed model has provided a deep insight into the molecular level interactions of
RR-urea model complexes in understanding the exact pharmacophore for designing highly potent RR inhi-
bitors. Overall, the present work has shed light in developing a feasible and robust approach for the synthesis
of novel urea derivatives of 2-amino-3-carbomethoxythiophene and identiﬁed a part of molecular structure
that is responsible for a speciﬁc biological interaction leading to potential anticancer activities."
26,Recent Advances of Polyaniline-Based Biomaterials for Phototherapeutic Treatments of Tumors and Bacterial Infections,"Abstract: Conventional treatments fail to completely eradicate tumor or bacterial infections due to
their inherent shortcomings. In recent years, photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as an attractive
treatment modality that relies on the absorption of photothermal agents (PTAs) at a speciﬁc wavelength,
thereby transforming the excitation light energy into heat. The advantages of PTT are its high eﬃcacy,
speciﬁcity, and minimal damage to normal tissues. To this end, various inorganic nanomaterials
such as gold nanostructures, carbon nanostructures, and transition metal dichalcogenides have been
extensively explored for PTT applications. Subsequently, the focus has shifted to the development
of polymeric PTAs, owing to their unique properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility,
non-immunogenicity, and low toxicity when compared to inorganic PTAs. Among various organic
PTAs, polyaniline (PANI) is one of the best-known and earliest-reported organic PTAs. Hence, in this
review, we cover the recent advances and progress of PANI-based biomaterials for PTT application in
tumors and bacterial infections. The future prospects in this exciting area are also addressed."
27,Sensitivity Analysis of a Flexible Piezoresistive Sensor for Efficient Packaging,"Abstract—In this study, the packaging requirements and 
challenges of a microstructure-based flexible piezoresistive 
pressure sensor are investigated. The sensor shows a high value 
of sensitivity of 9.51 kPa-1 at low (0 – 10 kPa), 0.24 kPa-1 at 
medium (10 – 40 kPa), and 0.11 kPa-1 at high pressure ranges 
(40 – 70 kPa). The sensor was experimentally characterized for 
a pressure range of 0 – 70 kPa and its piezoresistive  response 
was measured. Sensitivity performance at different regions of 
the sensor was analyzed.  The experimental data for sensitivity 
shows a high variation in the sensitivity of the sensor for 
different regions of pressure application with values being 
quite low at the periphery and a high value near the center 
(equivalent to the case of uniform applied pressure). Packaging 
issues related to the sensor are addressed based on the 
outcomes."

developments. In this study, we demonstrate a polymer-based
capacitive pressure sensor for measuring heart rate and pulse

ized to evaluate its performance and to verify its repeatability
and precision. It is observed that the sensor works in the range of
0–8-kPa pressure range and is suitable for measuring the PP. This
sensor has a high sensitivity of 7.11 kPa−1 in the low-pressure
range of 0–8 kPa. Furthermore, the sensor demonstrated a
considerable amount of repeatability with an error of less
than 6% in consecutive measurements. Moreover, the sensor
demonstrated the use of a wearable, flexible piezo-capacitive
pressure sensor for PP monitoring. The wrist pulse was used as
the stimulus for the experimental characterization of the sensor,
and health markers related to the measured response were also
discussed."
27,Flexible ZnO Thin-Film Based Photosensor for Applications in Light-Induced Automation,"Abstract— In this work, we proposed a photosensor based on 
ZnO (Zinc Oxide) nanoparticles on a flexible substrate for light-
induced automation. The large band gap and mobility of charge 
carriers in ZnO are harnessed to make a flexible sensor for the 
detection of light. The device is fabricated with a simple and 
cost-effective method. ZnO thin film is deposited using printed 
methods over the PET and paper substrate and electrically 
characterized. It is observed that the device resistance and 
current values under fixed bias are different in dark and light 
conditions. The resistance value decreases by at least 36% under 
the illumination of visible light. The response time of the 
fabricated photosensor is observed at 0.51 s. The sensor is 
currently used only for qualitative analysis to measure the 
difference between dark and light conditions. The purpose of 
this sensor is to automate shutters, doors, and similar 
applications."

28,Advancing Malware Detection in Network Traffic With Self-Paced Class Incremental Learning,"Abstract—Ensuring network security, effective malware detec-
tion (MD) is of paramount importance. Traditional methods
often struggle to accurately learn and process the characteristics
of network trafﬁc data, and must balance rapid processing
with retaining memory for previously encountered malware
categories as new ones emerge. To tackle these challenges,
we propose a cutting-edge approach using self-paced class
incremental learning (SPCIL). This method harnesses network
trafﬁc data for enhanced class incremental learning (CIL). A
pivotal technique in deep learning, CIL facilitates the integration
of new malware classes while preserving recognition of prior
categories. The unique loss function in our SPCIL-driven
MD combines sparse pairwise loss with sparse loss, striking
an optimal balance between model simplicity and accuracy.
Experimental results reveal that SPCIL proﬁciently identiﬁes
both existing and emerging malware classes, adeptly addressing
catastrophic forgetting. In comparison to other incremental
learning approaches, SPCIL stands out in performance and
efﬁciency. It operates with a minimal model parameter count
(8.35 million) and in increments of 2, 4, and 5, achieves impressive
accuracy rates of 89.61%, 94.74%, and 97.21% respectively,
underscoring its effectiveness and operational efﬁciency."

damage are crucial for road maintenance and traffic safety.
Traditional road damage inspection methods, such as manual
inspection and manual annotation, are inefficient and costly.
Therefore, computer vision methods have become a faster and
more cost-effective choice. In this study, we collected a dataset
called RoadBHD, which consists of 4,579 images and 5,005 labels,
including six types of road damage. We built a low-cost and effi-
cient vehicle-mounted road damage detection system based on the
YOLOv5s network model. Through experimental comparisons,
the YOLOv5s network demonstrated superior performance in
road damage detection compared to Faster R-CNN and SSD
networks. This validates the feasibility of our designed vehicle-
mounted road damage detection system."

pavement defects and related parameter information. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight road crack and damage detection
(RoadCDD) method using You Only Look Once v5s (Yolov5s)
framework. First, we build a real dataset of RoadCAVS, which
contains 15,612 images with 18,709 labels, 12 kinds of damage
or rational assets. Then, we train the Yolov5s model based on
the dataset with single shot multiBox detector (SSD) and aster
R-CNN respectively. Finally, the provided experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed RoadCDD method outperforms
existing baseline methods. Moreover, our proposed RoadCCD
method also shows excellent performance in real-time detection,
making it a promising approach for practical implementation in
RoadCDD systems."
28,An Automatic Pavement Crack Detection System with FocusCrack Dataset,"Abstract—Road safety has always been one of the main
concerns. With the development of deep learning, computer
vision has begun to be used in road damage detection. It has
the advantages of faster detection speed, lower cost, easier
deployment, etc., which greatly reduces trafﬁc accidents caused
by the road. We design an automatic detection system for road
damages and deploy it on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX. A dataset
named FocusCrack is collected under diversiform roads and
various lighting conditions. It contains six types of diseases, a
total of 4181 images and 5812 labels. Compared with performance
of several mainstream algorithms like Faster R-CNN and Single
Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), the model adopts the You Only

the precision, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 are 90.1%,

28,Self-evolving Malware Detection for Cyber Security using Network Traffic and Incremental Learning,"Abstract—Malware detection is an important step in network
security. Traditional malware detection methods suffer from the
ability to learn, understand, process, and apply characteristics of
network traffic data accurately, and in a relatively short space
of time. It also cannot learn new tasks without forgetting the old
tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-evolving malware detection
(SEMD) method using network traffic and incremental learning.
Incremental learning (IL) method is one of the important
methods in deep learning, which can learn new tasks without
forgetting the old tasks. Its loss function draws lessons from the
idea of knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that
the proposed method can recognize both old tasks and new tasks
(overcoming the problem of catastrophic network forgetting). The
performance of the proposed SEMD method is also better than
the general method of incremental learning without self-evolving."
29,Topology-Aware Scheduling Framework for Microservice Applications in Cloud,"Abstract—Loosely coupled and highly cohesived microservices
running in containers are becoming the new paradigm for ap-
plication development. Compared with monolithic applications,
applications built on microservices architecture can be deployed
and scaled independently, which promises to simplify software
development and operation. However, the dramatic increase in
the scale of microservices and east-west network trafﬁc in the
data center have made the cluster management more complex.
Not only does the scale of microservices cause a great deal of
pressure on cluster management, but also cascading QoS violations
present a substantial risk for SLOs (Service Level Objectives). In
this paper, we propose a Microservice-Oriented Topology-Aware
Scheduling Framework (MOTAS), which effectively utilizes the
topologies of microservices and clusters to optimize the network
overhead of microservice applications through a heuristic graph
mapping algorithm. The proposed framework can also guarantee
the cluster resource utilization. To deal with the dynamic environ-
mentofmicroservice,weproposeamechanismbasedondistributed

been proved to be effective in ensuring cluster resource utilization,

30,Does Chinese policy banks' overseas lending favor Belt Road Initiative countries?,"Abstract
This paper examines how Chinese policy banks responded
to China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI) using transaction‐
level international syndicated loan data. Employing a
difference‐in‐differences (DID) estimation, we show that
Chinese policy banks increased aggregate lending (number
of loans and loan amounts) to ﬁrms from the BRI
countries compared to those from the non‐BRI countries
after the initiative. This increase was more pronounced
among ﬁrms along the continental route and in the
infrastructure sectors. We also ﬁnd that Chinese policy
banks' loans to the BRI borrowers were associated with
reduced
spread,
lowered
collateral
requirement,
and
extended maturity. Moreover, our results suggest that
Chinese policy banks gave more support to ﬁrms from the
BRI countries with weaker economic performance, more
fragile institutional quality, and closer political interests.
Overall, our study highlights the supportive role played by
Chinese policy banks in implementing a national global-
ization strategy.

though supported by the state-owned banks. How does
the COVID-19 affect SMEs’ financing in emerging

a negative impact on non-Hubei SMEs having sup-
ply chain relationships with Hubei province. Such
effects rippled through the supply chain and exerted
an intensified strike on the SMEs with Hubei cus-
tomers. Finally, we find the state-owned banks eased
the LOC to Hubei SMEs during the pandemic out-
break. According to our study, government COVID-
supportive policies should target the SME subgroups
such as non-SOEs, firms that heavily rely on supply
chain, and those without stable bank relationships.

Superstition is prevalent in rural areas, yet very few studies examine whether it affects rural

significant 18.5% increase in life insurance expenditure during the head's zodiac year. Such a

market value change when corporate insiders pledge their shareholdings during China's 
COVID-19 outbreak. It is found that market investors responded adversely to share pledging 
announcements by firms in the high pandemic-affected regions. Besides, the state ownership 
and better corporate governance structures of the pledged firms could mitigate such adverse

  To what extent did independent directors help firms' recovery during the COVID-19 
pandemic? In this paper, we answer this question by investigating whether independent 
directors contribute to Chinese listed firms' operation income growth during the first and 
second quarters of the year 2020. By employing a triple difference-in-differences (DDD) 
estimation strategy, we show that firms located in more pandemic-affected regions experienced 
a more pronounced operating recovery if they receive more independent directors' opinions 
and have fewer female and busy directors. The possible reason is that those female and busy 
directors were likely to be distracted during the pandemic outbreak. We also provide evidence 
that firms paying higher remunerations to independent directors tend to recover quicker. 
Moreover, independent directors' age and education level positively contribute to firms' 
recovery. Our work is among the first to study independent directors' role in shaping firms'

31,SIW-based Hexagonal Slot MIMO Antenna Array for 28 GHz Millimeter-Wave Applications,"Abstract— This paper presents a substrate integrated 
waveguide (SIW) based MIMO antenna array operating at 28 
GHz, intended for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) wireless 
applications. The design entails a hexagonal slot etched into the 
upper layer of the SIW cavity. Through meticulous optimization 
of different parameters (the slot’s dimensions and its placement 
within the SIW cavity), a broadside radiation pattern is resulted 
featuring an impedance bandwidth of 370 MHz (from 27.82 
GHz to 28.19 GHz) centered around 28 GHz and a peak gain of 
6.10 dBi. To further improve the antenna’s performance, a 1×2 
antenna array is devised, accompanied by an SIW feed network. 
This array geometry yields a maximum gain of 8.28 dBi and an 
impedance bandwidth spanning 0.87 GHz (from 27.59 GHz to 
28.46 GHz). To further enhance channel capacity, a 1×4 MIMO 
array is formulated by extending the antenna array. Thus the 
proposed structure encompasses several notable attributes 
including large operating gain, and good channel capacity, along

artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) backed printed

antenna for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) 5G wireless body

The AMC structure consists of 5 × 4 unit cells that are made 
up of two interconnected I-shaped slots etched out of a 
metallic patch (Jerusalem Cross). With the use of AMC, 
the antenna gain at 28 GHz increases by 4.89 dBi due to 
the suppression of surface wave. The specific absorption 
rate (SAR) and power density are also reduced by the 
AMC. The performance of the AMC-backed antenna 
remains consistent in the two-port MIMO antenna having 
an overall dimension of 25 × 40 × 3.7 mm3. In addition,

composite fading channel. For this purpose two probability 
density functions have been taken. One is Weibull function and 
another one is log-normal function. Both functions have been 
combined to find the new composite fading channel called as

32,A Reference-Free Calibration for Ultrafast Spatiotemporally Encoded 2-D NMR Spectroscopy,"Abstract—Spatiotemporal encoding (SPEN) is a state-of-the-
art nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, utilized to
acquire 2-D or even multidimensional (n-D) NMR spectra and/or
images in a single (or a few) scans. Beneﬁtting from special encod-
ing and decoding schemes, SPEN can thus accelerate the classical
2-D NMR experiment by orders of magnitude. SPEN’s decoding
in particular is executed under the effects of oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld gradients; inevitable hardware imperfections may then give
rise to inconsistencies between odd and even SPEN data lines,
making only half (odd or even) of the acquired data available for
processing. This halves the spectral bandwidth available in the
direct dimension and decreases the spectral sensitivity, leading
to the emergence of peak folding artifacts and/or a decline of the
spectral quality. Past research has been carried out to correct
these distortions induced by gradient imperfections, but requires
an extra reference scan collected under identical experimental
conditions. This work presents a detailed theoretical analysis of
the impacts of various imperfections on the 2-D SPEN NMR
spectrum and proposes a three-step reference-free calibration
algorithm in accordance with theoretical analysis. Experimental
data on single-shot 2-D correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and
heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra
collected using SPEN were performed and processed, which
demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed

32,Deep Feature Selection for Anomaly Detection Based on Pretrained Network and Gaussian Discriminative Analysis,"ABSTRACT
Deep learning neural network serves as a powerful tool for visual anomaly detection (AD)
and fault diagnosis, attributed to its strong abstractive interpretation ability in the representation domain.
The deep features from neural networks that are pretrained on the ImageNet classification task have been
proved to be useful for AD based on Gaussian discriminant analysis. However, with the ever-increasing
complexity of deep learning neural networks, the set of deep features becomes massive where redundancy
appears to be inevitable. The redundant features increase computational cost and degrade the performance
of the AD method. In this article, we discuss the deep feature selection for the AD task and show how
to reduce the redundancy in the representation domain. We propose a horizontal selection (dimensional
reduction) method of features with subspace decomposition and a vertical selection to identify the most
effective network layer for AD and fault diagnosis. We test the proposed method on two public datasets,
one for AD task and the other for fault diagnosis of bearings. We show the significance of different
network layers and feature subspaces on AD tasks and prove the effectiveness of the feature selection
strategy."
32,High-Resolution Reconstruction for Multidimensional Laplace NMR,"ABSTRACT: As a perfect complement to conventional NMR that
aims for chemical structure elucidation, Laplace NMR constitutes a
powerful technique to study spin relaxation and diﬀusion, revealing
information on molecular motions and spin interactions. Diﬀerent
from conventional NMR adopting Fourier transform to deal with the
acquired data, Laplace NMR relies on specially designed signal
processing and reconstruction algorithms resembling the inverse
Laplace transform, and it generally faces severe challenges in cases
where high spectral resolution and high spectral dimensionality are
required. Herein, based on the tensor technique for high-dimensional
problems and the sparsity assumption, we propose a general method
for high-resolution reconstruction of multidimensional Laplace NMR data. We show that the proposed method can reconstruct
multidimensional Laplace NMR spectra in a high-resolution manner for exponentially decaying relaxation and diﬀusion data
acquired by commercial NMR instruments. Therefore, it would broaden the scope of multidimensional Laplace NMR applications.
N
MR spectroscopy oﬀers a robust and noninvasive tool
for applications in various ﬁelds, such as chemistry,
biology, and materials science.1 As an eﬀective technique
revealing atomic level information on chemical shifts and J
couplings, conventional NMR experiments (e.g., 1D NMR2
and 2D COSY3) are widely used in molecular structure
determination, conformation elucidation, and composition
analysis.4 However, relaxation and diﬀusion parameters related
to molecular dynamics and spin interactions5−8 are inaccessible
by conventional NMR and are generally provided by Laplace
NMR experiments. Theoretically, due to the exponentially
decaying signals caused by the relaxation and diﬀusion
processes, the Inversion Laplace Transform (ILT) can be
adopted to retrieve the distribution of relaxation times or
diﬀusion coeﬃcients.9 Compared to conventional NMR
experiments, where acquired Free Induction Decay (FID)
signals are directly converted to spectral peaks in the frequency
domain by the Fourier Transform (FT), Laplace NMR
involves more complicated processing algorithms to extract
the desired dynamic information on diﬀusion and relaxation
due to the ill-posed nature of the ILT problem. Generally, only
approximate results can be obtained from Laplace NMR
experimental data based on given constraint conditions.
It is clear that high-resolution Laplace NMR requires
eﬃcient data reconstruction algorithms for resolving each
spectral peak. Although many ILT reconstruction methods
have been proposed, it remains challenging to hit the spot of
high-resolution Laplace NMR measurements. Current recon-
struction methods employ constraints and regularizations10 to
deal with the ill-posed ILT. For example, the Maximum
Entropy Method (MaxEnt)11 constrains the reconstructed
spectra with the maximum entropy for DOSY12 processing.
The Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Multi-Exponential
Decay (ITAMeD)13 uses L1 norm regularization and non-
negativity constraint to reconstruct 1D Laplace NMR spectra.
The Low-Rank and Sparsity Inverse Laplace Transform
(LRSpILT)14 exploits combined L1 norm and nuclear norm
regularization as well as non-negativity constraint for 2D high-
resolution DOSY12 reconstruction. The Constrained Regula-
rization Method for Inverting Data (CONTIN)15 adopts the
second derivative Tikhonov regularization and non-negativity
constraint. Marginal Distributions Constrained Optimization
(MADCO)16 uses 1D distributions measured with full
sampling as constraints in the reconstruction of 2D
distributions. However, because of the eﬃciency and
eﬀectiveness of the reconstruction algorithms which are
substantially in demand in the multidimensional ILT
reconstruction, these methods still suﬀer from peak broadening
and fail to resolve congested peaks. To address the challenge of
congested peaks in ILT reconstructions, we point out that one
should focus on the optimization algorithm besides constraints
and regularization. In practice, the optimization algorithm
decides how to search in the solution space and when to

terminate and outputs the results. Thus, even for the same
model, diﬀerent optimizers yield diﬀerent eﬃciencies, which
depend on a practical problem. To match the optimization
algorithm for the ill-posed ILT problem is of much
importance.
In this study, we propose a high-resolution multidimensional
Laplace NMR reconstruction method, named Enhanced
Discerning Multidimensional Inverse Laplace Transform
(EDMILT), based on the sparsity assumption17 and the
tensor technique. The sparsity assumption states that only a
few nonzero points exist in the desired reconstructed results,
while the tensor technique promotes the proposed method for
nD (n ≥3) reconstruction. The EDMILT exploits L1 norm
regularization and non-negativity constraint and adopts the
Truncated Newton Interior Point Method (TNIPM)18
algorithm for iterative optimization. The TNIPM, suitable
for the high-resolution multidimensional Laplace NMR
reconstruction where a large scale and sparse reconstruction
is required, tends to eﬀectively ﬁnd a series of discrete nonzero
points, i.e. a group of sharp spectral peaks, as reconstructed
results, thus enhancing adjacent peak separation and achieving
high-resolution multidimensional Laplace NMR spectra. This
proposed method is a tensor-based multidimensional Laplace
NMR reconstruction method considering constraints, regula-
rizations, and algorithm property to deal with the challenge of
ill-posed ILT. The EDMILT is robust and eﬀective for 1D and
even nD Laplace NMR reconstructions, which may serve as a
general technical tool for high-dimensional Laplace NMR
development.
It is assumed that matrix K denotes a Laplace kernel whose
element Kij is deﬁned as eq 1 for T1 relaxation and as eq 2 for
T2 relaxation or diﬀusion, s is the measured relaxation or
diﬀusion data which is normalized preferably before
reconstruction, x is the reconstructed vector of 1D Laplace
NMR spectrum and initialized as a vector whose entries all
equal 1 in the TNIPM optimized iteration. The ILT objective
function can be formulated as eq 3.

ﬁdelity and regularization terms, is normally set between 0.001
and 0.1 empirically. The regularization parameter eﬀect on
EDMILT reconstructed results is analyzed in the Supporting
Information. Due to the sparsity constraint on x, EDMILT is
inclined to generate sharp peaks. In this sense, EDMILT keeps
a good peak shape for monodisperse samples but not for
polydisperse samples whose peaks are intrinsically broad.
Actually, EDMILT employs sharp peaks to ﬁt the broad peaks;
i.e., EDMILT obtains the average diﬀusion coeﬃcients (decay
constants) of polydisperse components. See the Supporting

broad peak reconstruction.

The applicability of DOSY measurements on complex mixtures is
generally limited by the performance of data reconstruction

together along the spectral dimension. This proposed method is
robust and suitable for DOSY data acquired from common commercial NMR instruments; thus, it may broaden the scope of
DOSY applications.
N
uclear magnetic resonance (NMR)1 constitutes a
commonly used technique for compound identiﬁcation,2
quantitative detection,3 and structural analysis4 in complex
mixtures. Diﬀusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY)5,6
presents an eﬀective tool for identifying chemical substances in
mixtures and detecting intermolecular interactions7 by diﬀer-
entiating NMR signals of a compound mixture according to
diﬀerences in the molecular translational diﬀusion. The
validation of the resulting DOSY spectra signiﬁcantly depends
on eﬀective data reconstruction algorithms. The most essential
functions of DOSY are to resolve overlapping peaks, separate
signals from diﬀerent compounds, and group signals that
belong to the identical molecule. Correspondingly, perform-
ance of the DOSY reconstruction algorithm is evaluated by the
alignment of peaks from the same molecule and the
distinguishment of individual peaks (i.e., spectral resolution).
A high-resolution DOSY spectrum8 should have excellent peak
alignment and narrow peak width in diﬀusion dimension.
Unfortunately, these two objectives in high-resolution DOSY
are diﬃcult to achieve concurrently, particularly for measure-
ments of complex mixtures that contain congested 1D NMR
resonances.
DOSY reconstruction methods are roughly divided into two
categories, namely exponential ﬁtting and inverse Laplace
transform. Exponential ﬁtting, including SPLMOD (spline
model),9,10 CORE (component resolved NMR spectrosco-
py),11 DECRA (direct exponential curve resolution algo-
rithm),12,13 SCORE (speedy component resolved NMR
spectroscopy),14 and MRC (multivariate curve resolution),15,16
among others,17 requires the accurate number of molecular
components in advance, which generally leads to unstable and
invalid reconstruction spectra if inaccurate number estimation
of molecular components is provided. Diﬀerent from
exponential ﬁtting, the inverse Laplace transform dispenses
with the number of molecular components as a prerequisite.
These methods are implemented based on the fact that decay
signals along the gradient dimension and diﬀusion distribution
signals along the diﬀusion dimension constitute a Laplace
transform pair18 (i.e., diﬀusion distribution signals are the
Laplace transform of the gradient ﬁeld decay signals). Many
optimization methods for solving the inverse problem have
been proposed for DOSY reconstruction, such as the non-
negative least-squares (NNLS) method,19 Tikhonov regulari-
zation method,20 constrained regularization (CONTIN),20,21
entropy maximization (MaxEnt),22 iterative thresholding
algorithm for multiexponential decay (ITAMed),23 sparse
and Tikhonov combined regularization method,24 and
others.25,26 These methods are basically designed for 1D
reconstruction. Therefore, to obtain the 2D DOSY spectrum,
each row of the spectrum corresponding to each frequency
component is reconstructed individually, which would induce
misalignment of peaks in the diﬀusion dimension due to
inevitable computational errors. To address this issue, Yuan et
al. proposed a 2D method called simultaneous inversion of
Laplace transform (SILT),27 which exploits the low-rank
property of 2D DOSY spectrum data and uses nuclear norm
for regularization constraint. The 2D low-rank property works
like a spectral comb to increase peak alignment along the
diﬀusion dimension but with an undesirable eﬀect of peak

broadening and might even induce some artifacts under the
worst-case scenario, which does not satisfy the criteria of high-
resolution DOSY. From Figure 1(a) and (b), it can be seen
that peak broadening in reconstructed spectra by SILT
increases the diﬃculty in distinguishing molecular components
with close diﬀusion coeﬃcients.
In this work, we propose a general 2D inverse Laplace
transform method, called low-rank and sparse inverse Laplace
transform (LRSpILT), for high-resolution DOSY reconstruc-
tion on complex mixtures. This method is designed based on
the joint constraints on low-rank and sparsity of DOSY
data28,29 to achieve excellent peak alignment and accurate
diﬀusion coeﬃcient estimation with narrow peak width in the
diﬀusion dimension, thus leading to high-resolution DOSY
reconstruction. As Figure 1 (c) and (d) show, LRSpILT
maintains the alignment of peaks with the same diﬀusion
coeﬃcients and gives results with narrowed peaks in the
diﬀusion dimension, which represents reduced estimation
uncertainty of diﬀusion coeﬃcients. The resulting spectra
present signiﬁcantly improved resolution and satisfactory
distinguishment between adjacent peaks compared to SILT.
■METHODS
A pulse ﬁeld gradient (PFG) signal is a kind of decay signal
similar to relaxation signals that decay with evolution time. To
obtain the decay rates of these signals, one should apply
inverse Laplace transform (ILT) or exponential ﬁtting instead
of Fourier transform, which is suitable for analysis of frequency
but not decay rate (detailed in Supporting Information).
Exponential ﬁtting methods aim to obtain decay rates by
minimizing the error between acquired signal and exponential
ﬁtting model, which can be modeled as

component, respectively, and N is the number of exponential
decay components, which is 1 for monoexponential ﬁtting and

where g is the gradient vector. Without loss of generality, we
apply the model of the gradient ﬁeld decay signal for the rest of
the paper. Eq 2 requires a given N to perform the ﬁtting, and
diﬀerent N would lead to diﬀerent results.
To relax the assumption of the exponential ﬁtting method,
ILT implements a diﬀerent strategy, where the speciﬁc values
of αi are not required to be estimated but given as grid points
on the range of interest, and N is the number of grid points.
Then, eq 2 can be reformulated into the matrix form:

represents the intensities or contributions of each component.
We can infer by eq 3 that ILT decomposes PFG signal s into a
group of exponential decay signals, like Fourier transform
decomposes signals into a group of frequency signals. But,
diﬀerent from the linear and unitary Fourier transform, the ILT
problem is ill-posed, which means there are inﬁnite number of
possible solutions for eq 3. For this reason, more constraints
should be given to the estimated solution to ensure a
reasonable result.
LRSpILT penalizes the rank and data intensities of the
reconstructed spectra to control the level of complexity of the
result. Thus, the result for LRSpILT should possess the
property of joint Low-Rank and sparsity, which suggests that
our desired result should be composed of less exponential
decay components and these components should be well-
aligned. The optimization model29 of LRSpILT is

principal components (or the eigenvectors) extracted from the matrix by singular value decomposition (SVD)
could be applied for harmonic signal denoising. However, SVD is time-consuming, and may even fail to
converge when the data matrix is too large. To overcome the computational difﬁculties of SVD for the big
dataset, dimension reduction of the matrix is necessary, but it results in a signiﬁcant reduction on signal
intensities. In this paper, we proposed an efﬁcient and robust denoising method for harmonic signals with
large data. First, the Hankel matrix of the harmonic signal is constructed and randomly projected onto a
lower dimensional subspace with a Gaussian matrix. Second, SVD on the matrix with reduced dimension is
performed to extract essential eigenvectors, applying which a smooth signal with simpliﬁed compositions is
reconstructed from the original noisy signal. Third, the threshold of signal to noise is analyzed on the smooth
signal, then a soft thresholding algorithm is performed to obtain a denoised result from the original noisy
signal. The simulation and experimental results have proved the robustness and effectiveness of this method."
32,Amplitude Estimation and Source Separation for Harmonics Within Two Mixtures Based on a Min-Rank Criterion,"Abstract—Exponentially decaying sinusoidal signal model is
generally applied in a wide range of engineering and research
ﬁelds. In order to analyze the signal components quantitatively,
we need to extract the important parameters, i.e., amplitudes,
frequencies, and damping factors, from the signals. In some prac-
tical applications, we can obtain multiple signals from multiple
sensors or with multiple procedures. In such a way, the acquired
signals are composed of similar sources or components but
with different intensities. How to separate different sources
and estimate the intensities of each source within the signals
is essential for further analysis. In this paper, we separated
different sources within two mixtures by estimating the relative
intensities of the sources within mixtures. First, to evaluate
a “clean” separation result, we proposed a minimum rank
criterion, i.e., the Hankel matrices of the isolated sources should
have the minimum rank, which corresponds to a simpliﬁed signal
composition. Second, in order to minimize the rank of the Hankel
matrices, we reformulated the objective function as a generalized
eigenvalue decomposition problem, which can be solved based on
the minimum perturbation theory. By this method, we can detect
the number and intensities of common harmonic components
within two mixtures, and isolate two complicated source signals
with highly overlapped spectra from the mixtures. The proposed
method can be applied for signal simpliﬁcation or component
quantiﬁcation in a wide range of areas, such as biomedical or
electrical engineering, where the signals are usually modeled as
a sum of sinusoidal components.

32,ARTICLE,"Abstract
A multi-objective genetic algorithm is intro-
duced to predict the assignment of protein solid-state NMR
(SSNMR) spectra with partial resonance overlap and
missing peaks due to broad linewidths, molecular motion,
and low sensitivity. This non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm II (NSGA-II) aims to identify all possible
assignments that are consistent with the spectra and to
compare the relative merit of these assignments. Our
approach is modeled after the recently introduced Monte-
Carlo simulated-annealing (MC/SA) protocol, with the key
difference that NSGA-II simultaneously optimizes multiple
assignment objectives instead of searching for possible
assignments based on a single composite score. The mul-
tiple objectives include maximizing the number of con-
sistently assigned peaks between multiple spectra (‘‘good
connections’’), maximizing the number of used peaks,
minimizing the number of inconsistently assigned peaks
between spectra (‘‘bad connections’’), and minimizing the
number of assigned peaks that have no matching peaks in
the other spectra (‘‘edges’’). Using six SSNMR protein
chemical shift datasets with varying levels of imperfection
that was introduced by peak deletion, random chemical
shift changes, and manual peak picking of spectra with
moderately broad linewidths, we show that the NSGA-II
algorithm produces a large number of valid and good
assignments rapidly. For high-quality chemical shift peak
lists,
NSGA-II
and
MC/SA
perform
similarly
well.
However, when the peak lists contain many missing peaks
that are uncorrelated between different spectra and have
chemical shift deviations between spectra, the modiﬁed
NSGA-II produces a larger number of valid solutions than
MC/SA, and is more effective at distinguishing good from
mediocre assignments by avoiding the hazard of subopti-
mal weighting factors for the various objectives. These two
advantages, namely diversity and better evaluation, lead to
a higher probability of predicting the correct assignment
for a larger number of residues. On the other hand, when
there are multiple equally good assignments that are sig-
niﬁcantly different from each other, the modiﬁed NSGA-II
is less efﬁcient than MC/SA in ﬁnding all the solutions.
This problem is solved by a combined NSGA-II/MC
algorithm, which appears to have the advantages of both
NSGA-II and MC/SA. This combination algorithm is
robust for the three most difﬁcult chemical shift datasets
examined here and is expected to give the highest-quality
de novo assignment of challenging protein NMR spectra."
32,ARTICLE,"Abstract
We introduce a Python-based program that
utilizes the large database of 13C and 15N chemical shifts in
the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank to rapidly predict
the amino acid type and secondary structure from corre-
lated chemical shifts. The program, called PACSYlite
Uniﬁed Query (PLUQ), is designed to help assign peaks
obtained from 2D 13C–13C, 15N–13C, or 3D 15N–13C–13C
magic-angle-spinning correlation spectra. We show sec-
ondary-structure speciﬁc 2D 13C–13C correlation maps of
all twenty amino acids, constructed from a chemical shift
database of 262,209 residues. The maps reveal interesting
conformation-dependent chemical shift distributions and
facilitate searching of correlation peaks during amino-acid
type assignment. Based on these correlations, PLUQ out-
puts the most likely amino acid types and the associated
secondary structures from inputs of experimental chemical
shifts. We test the assignment accuracy using four high-
quality protein structures. Based on only the Ca and Cb
chemical shifts, the highest-ranked PLUQ assignments
were 40–60 % correct in both the amino-acid type and
the secondary structure. For three input chemical shifts
(CO–Ca–Cb or N–Ca–Cb), the ﬁrst-ranked assignments
were correct for 60 % of the residues, while within the top
three predictions, the correct assignments were found for
80 % of the residues. PLUQ and the chemical shift maps
are expected to be useful at the ﬁrst stage of sequential
assignment, for combination with automated sequential
assignment programs, and for highly disordered proteins
for which secondary structure analysis is the main goal of
structure determination."
32,Broadband frequency response analysis of transformer windings,"ABSTRACT 
In this paper, an analysis method of natural frequencies and corresponding oscillation 
modes for power transformer windings is proposed. Firstly, the natural frequencies and 
their response factors are calculated based on the structure and parameters of the 
transformer windings, then it is pointed out that not all of the input voltage at natural 
frequencies can cause significant oscillation in the windings. Secondly, the patterns of the 
oscillation modes corresponding to the natural frequencies are illustrated, which show the 
different effects of the oscillation modes on the voltages at different nodes in the windings. 
These patterns could help the transformer designers to estimate the insulation endurance 
of transformer against transient voltages containing particular frequency components."
32,A Circuit Model in a Wide Frequency Range for Power Transformer and Analysis of its Characteristics,"Abstract—In order to predict VFTO(Very Fast Transient 
Overvoltage) distributions in the windings during transformer 
design stage, it is important to acquire the frequency range of the 
surge wave that could enter the transformer winding, and then 
model the windings in that frequency range. In GIS (Gas 
Insulated Station), transformer is connected to bus through 
bushing and lead wire. The bushing capacitance to ground will 
bypass the high frequency components, so there should be a 
upper limit of the frequency components of the surge wave at the 
entrance of the transformer. In this paper, the transformer 
windings are modeled using MTL (Multi-Transmission-Line) 
model firstly, then the lumped equivalent circuit is formulated 
with the π-type circuits, and finally the driving-point impedance 
and voltage transfer functions of the equivalent circuit are 
calculated using nodal analysis. The driving-point impedance of a 
model winding is calculated and compared with the measured 
result, and the validation of the equivalent circuit of transformer 
winding in the frequency range below 20 MHz is verified. Then 
the driving-point impedances of two real transformer windings 
are calculated with the equivalent circuit. Taking the lead 
impedance into consideration, the impedance of the winding is 
compared with the one of the bushing capacitance. The results 
show that most of the energy of the frequency components above 
10 MHz in the surge wave will pass through the bushing 
capacitance and will not cause damage to transformer 
insulations."
32,Determination of VFTO waveform in GIS according to simplified structure of GIS bus and circuit parameters,"Abstract---Since there is no standard waveform of VFTO 
(Very Fast Transient Overvoltage) so far for power transformer 
manufactures, the designers need to use simulation method to 
obtain VFTO waveform and then calculate VFTO distributions 
in the windings and verify the abundance of the insulation 
design. In this paper, the analytical expressions of VFTO 
waveform are theoretically developed using transmission line 
equivalent circuit and Thevenin’s theorem for the GIS bus 
systems without branch and with one-branch in the gas insulated 
substation (GIS). The effects of bus length, bus characteristic 
impedance, and transformer external equivalent capacitance on 
VFTO waveform are also analyzed and some results of practical 
importance are obtained. The simulation results using PSCAD 
software are consistent with the analytical results."
32,"See discussions, st ats, and author pr ofiles f or this public ation at : https://www .researchgate.ne t/public ation/266340830","Abstract— While modeling the windings in wide frequency range, the turn-to-turn model based
on multi-transmission-line (MTL) is usually used so that the wave propagation in the turns could
be well considered. To use that method the coils rolling around the axis should approximate to
a group of parallel straight lines with the same length. However, it is hard to explain if the
same length assumption could cause inaccuracy. In this paper, a circular MTL (CMTL) model is
developed for modeling of wide frequency transient response in core-type transformer windings.
Diﬀerent from the MTL model, the equations of the CMTL model are built in the cylindrical
coordinate system, where the per-unit-radian coeﬃcient matrixes are calculated. Based on further
discussion, it is found that CMTL model could be changed to MTL model where all lines have the
same length; but in high frequency region the multiplication of the capacitance and inductance
matrixes could hardly be diagonal."

33,Toward Minimal Data Rate Enforcing Regular Safety Properties: An Invariance Entropy Approach,"Abstract—The study of minimal data rate for control
using some notions of entropy has been so far limited
to classical control tasks such as set invariance, state-
estimation, or stabilization. In this letter, for the ﬁrst time,
we present a study on sufﬁcient data rates to enforce regu-
lar safety properties over uncertain systems with dynamics
described by set valued maps. Every regular safety prop-
erty has a set of bad preﬁxes which can be modelled
by a deterministic ﬁnite automaton (DFA). The main idea
is to construct a hybrid system by taking the product of
the deterministic ﬁnite automata with the given system
and studying the invariance feedback entropy (IFE) of con-
trolled invariant sets of the hybrid system. If there exists
a nonempty controlled invariant set for the hybrid system
satisfying a certain property then there exists a coder-
controller with a data rate not less than the IFE that can
enforce the regular safety property over the original control
system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results
by designing a coder-controller enforcing a regular safety
property over a linear control system."

For a closed-loop system with a digital channel between the sensor and controller, invariance entropy quantifies the smallest average
rate of information above which a compact subset Q of the state set can be made invariant. There exist different versions of
invariance entropy for deterministic and uncertain control systems, which are equivalent in the deterministic case. In this paper,
we present the first numerical approaches to obtain rigorous upper bounds of these quantities. Our approaches are based on set-
valued numerical analysis and graph-theoretic constructions. We combine existing algorithms from the literature to carry out our
computations for several linear and nonlinear examples. A comparison with the theoretical values of the entropy shows that our
bounds are of the same order of magnitude as the actual values."
33,Modular Computation of Restoration Entropy for Networks of Systems: A Dissipativity Approach,"Abstract—The problem of state estimation based on
information received over a ﬁnite bit rate channel gives
rise to the study of minimal bit rate above which state can
be estimated with any desired accuracy. In the past few
years, researchers have studied the minimal average bit
rate which is sufﬁcient enough for state estimation such
that the estimation error stays within a given factor of its
initial value. The notion of restoration entropy character-
izes this type of bit rate. Recent results proposed numerical
schemes to estimate restoration entropy by the compu-
tation of singular values of the linearized systems. Such
schemes are either complex to implement or suffer severely
from computational complexity and the size of the state
dimension. In this letter, we describe a modular approach
to compute an upper bound of the restoration entropy
of a large network by decomposing the network to an
interconnection of smaller subsystems. Then, we formulate
a distributed optimization problem which is solved for each
subsystem separately and then their optimization results
are composed to get an upper bound of the restoration
entropy for the overall network. We illustrate the effective-
ness of our results by two examples.

ance entropy is a tight lower bound of the data rate of any
coder controller that achieves invariance in the closed loop.
We analyze uncertain linear control systems and derive a
universal lower bound of the invariance feedback entropy.
The lower bound depends on the absolute value of the
determinant of the system matrix and a ratio involving the
volume of the invariant set and the set of uncertainties.
Furthermore, we derive a lower bound of the data rate of
any static, memoryless coder controller. Both lower bounds
are intimately related and for certain cases it is possible to
bound the performance loss due to the restriction to static
coder controllers by 1 bit/time unit. We provide various

the smallest bit rate, from the coder to the controller in the
feedback loop, above which Q can be made invariant over a

establish three results for IFE. First, we show that the IFE of a
discrete-time uncertain control system Σ and a nonempty set Q is
upper bounded by the largest possible IFE of Σ and any member
of any ﬁnite partition of Q. Second, we consider two uncertain
control systems, Σ1 and Σ2, which are identical except for the

approaches are required for IoT applications to handle the exponentially growing
attacks generated from the increasing number of connected devices. With the limited
computational and storage capabilities of IoT devices, it is difﬁcult to implement
autonomic capability at each device. Hence, fog computing can be used to provide
autonomic security characteristics to IoT applications. The proposed fog computing-
based security approach has (1) attack forecasting module based on Gaussian process
regression model, (2) attack detection module using cognitive approach and corre-
lation analysis, (3) fuzzy-based incident response module to handle the attacks. The
experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of
detection accuracy and detection time."
33,Thesis Title,"ABSTRACT
The design of hardware and software for safety critical applications often involves
use of formal veriﬁcation techniques to ensure correctness of implementation. If
speciﬁcation fails to satisfy then the cycle of design and veriﬁcation needs to be
repeated. Lengthy and costly design process can be avoided by the use of auto-
mated controller synthesis techniques which can provide correct-by-construction
controller that enforces the desired formal speciﬁcation on the given system. Use
of synthesis techniques with continuous systems require construction of a symbolic
model which in turn require computation of reachable sets. The set of states that
can be attained by a system for given values of initial state, input and time horizon
is referred to as reachable state set.
As reachable sets are inﬁnite objects their exact computation is diﬃcult, thus their
overapproximations are usually computed whose accuracy aﬀects the computation
time and size of the synthesized controller. The choice of set representation also
plays an important role in accuracy of approximation and time requirement. We
used zonotopes which are centrally symmetric convex polytopes and are closed
under linear transformation and Minkowski sum.

33,EPiC Series in Computing,"Abstract
We present the results of a friendly competition for formal veriﬁcation of continuous
and hybrid systems with nonlinear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took
place as part of the workshop Applied Veriﬁcation for Continuous and Hybrid Systems
(ARCH) in 2018. In this year, six tools CORA, CORA/SX, C2E2, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL,
and SymReach (in alphabetic order) participated. They are applied to solve reachability
analysis problems on four benchmarks problems, one of them with hybrid dynamics. We
do not rank the tools based on the results, but show the current status and discover the
potential advantages of diﬀerent tools.

33,arXiv:1706.05242v2  [cs.SY]  5 Aug 2019INVARIANCE FEEDBACK ENTROPY,"Abstract. We introduce a novel notion of invariance feedback entropy to quantify
the state information that is required by any controller that enforces a given subset of
the state space to be invariant. We establish a number of elementary properties, e.g.
we provide conditions that ensure that the invariance feedback entropy is ﬁnite and
show for the deterministic case that we recover the well-known notion of entropy for
deterministic control systems. We prove the data rate theorem, which shows that the
invariance entropy is a tight lower bound of the data rate of any coder-controller that
achieves invariance in the closed loop. We analyze uncertain linear control systems and
derive a universal lower bound of the invariance feedback entropy. The lower bound
depends on the absolute value of the determinant of the system matrix and a ratio
involving the volume of the invariant set and the set of uncertainties. Furthermore, we
derive a lower bound of the data rate of any static, memoryless coder-controller. Both
lower bounds are intimately related and for certain cases it is possible to bound the
performance loss due to the restriction to static coder-controllers by 1 bit/time unit.
We provide various examples throughout the paper to illustrate and discuss diﬀerent
deﬁnitions and results."

34,Single-step fabrication of ZnO microflower thin films for highly efficient and reusable photocatalytic activity,"Abstract
Zinc oxide microflower thin films were deposited in a single-step process using cost-effective ultrasonic spray pyrolysis 
technique. Different molarity of precursor solution was used to grow the films. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy 
reveal the wurtzite structure of ZnO. Scanning electron microscope images showed the microflower morphology which has a 
better surface to volume ratio. Defects such as O interstitial and Zn vacancy were identified in these thin films with the help of 
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The contact angle of the films was found to decrease with increase in molarity of the 
precursor. Photocatalytic activity of three different molar samples (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 M) of ZnO were studied for methylene 
blue (MB) degradation and 0.15 M film demonstrated better degradation efficiency under UV–Vis light. Further degradation 
studies were performed on this film under exposure to natural sunlight. 90% degradation of the dye was observed in both 
the conditions upon exposure of 3.5 h. Effect of defects, molarity, bandgap and contact angle of ZnO on the photocatalytic 
performance is discussed. Repeatability studies performed under both UV–Vis and natural sunlight exposures showed only 
a minor deviation of 1% from the initial degradation efficiency.

ZnO nanoparticle composite with PDMS on flexible stainless 
steel (SS) substrate for energy harvesting application. 
Piezoelectric device performance was increased when SS 
substrate was modified with ZnO nanowires grown by 
ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. X-Ray Diffraction and field 
emission scanning electron microscope studies show that ZnO 
nanowires were grown on SS substrate and they are Wurtzite 
in nature. Capacitance value of the devices found to be 80 and 
110 pF respectively and relative permittivity was found to be 
5.32 and 5.57 respectively at 100 Hz. Responses of the devices 
were found to be 15.6 VP-P and 27.2 VP-P from the device due to 
impact of the fingertips."

34,Design and electro-thermo-mechanical analysis of high temperature molybdenum microheaters for exhaust gas sensing applications,"Abstract— Microheaters play a vital role in gas sensor 
applications. Exhaust gas sensors need high temperature 
microheaters to heat sensing films uniformly at low powers. In 
this paper, we present design and electro-thermo-mechanical 
analysis of molybdenum microheaters suitable for high 
temperature exhaust gas sensors. Double-spiral (DS), double-
meander (DM), cross-meander (CS), modified-S (MS) and 
modified double spiral (MDS) shape structures were 
considered for simulation. The geometry of the resistive 
structure was optimized to improve temperature uniformity 
over a heating area of 500 X 500 µm2. Simulations show that 
the microheater consumed 83.65 mW power to reach a 
maximum temperature of 800 oC with a temperature gradient 
of 8.2oC. Structural deformation of the microheater membrane 
was studied to determine its stability and reliability under high 
thermal stresses. The maximum membrane deformation was 
found to be 15.25 µm at 800oC. Platinum, tungsten and 
molybdenum microheaters were compared in terms of their 
power consumption, temperature gradient and membrane

34,Microsoft Word - P_1089.doc,"Abstract: This paper aims at designing an intelligent temperature measurement technique using J type 
thermocouple with an optimized neural network model. The objectives of this work are to (i) extend 
the linearity range of measurement to 100 % of the full scale, (ii) make the measurement system 
adaptive of variation in temperature coefficients and (iii) to achieve (i) and (ii) using optimal neural 
network. The output of thermocouple is in mV range. A suitable data conversion circuit is used to 
convert mV to voltage and to overcome the problem of interference of noise and open thermocouple 
detection. A suitable optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) block is added in cascade to data 
conversion unit. This arrangement helps to linearise the overall system and make it adaptive of 
variations in temperature coefficients. Since, the proposed intelligent temperature measurement 
technique produces adaptive of variation in physical properties of thermocouple. It avoids the 
requirement of repeated calibrations every time the thermocouple is replaced. Simulation results show 
that proposed measurement technique satisfies the objectives. Copyright © 2012 IFSA."
35,GSN: Generalisable Segmentation in Neural Radiance Field,"Abstract
Traditional Radiance Field (RF) representations capture de-
tails of a specific scene and must be trained afresh on each
scene. Semantic feature fields have been added to RFs to fa-
cilitate several segmentation tasks. Generalised RF represen-
tations learn the principles of view interpolation. A gener-
alised RF can render new views of an unknown and untrained
scene, given a few views. We present a way to distil feature
fields into the generalised GNT representation. Our GSN rep-
resentation generates new views of unseen scenes on the fly
along with consistent, per-pixel semantic features. This en-
ables multi-view segmentation of arbitrary new scenes. We
show different semantic features being distilled into gener-
alised RFs. Our multi-view segmentation results are on par
with methods that use traditional RFs. GSN closes the gap
between standard and generalisable RF methods significantly.

35,Dress-Me-Up: A Dataset & Method for Self-Supervised 3D Garment Retargeting,"Abstract
We propose a novel self-supervised framework for re-
targeting non-parameterized 3D garments onto 3D human
avatars of arbitrary shapes and poses, enabling 3D vir-
tual try-on (VTON). Existing self-supervised 3D retarget-
ing methods only support parametric and canonical gar-
ments, which can only be draped over parametric body,
e.g. SMPL. To facilitate the non-parametric garments and
body, we propose a novel method that introduces Isomap
Embedding based correspondences matching between the
garment and the human body to get a coarse alignment be-
tween the two meshes. We perform neural refinement of the
coarse alignment in a self-supervised setting. Further, we
leverage a Laplacian detail integration method for preserv-
ing the inherent details of the input garment. For evalu-
ating our 3D non-parametric garment retargeting frame-
work, we propose a dataset of 255 real-world garments with
realistic noise and topological deformations. The dataset
contains 44 unique garments worn by 15 different subjects
in 5 distinctive poses, captured using a multi-view RGBD
capture setup.
We show superior retargeting quality on
non-parametric garments and human avatars over existing
state-of-the-art methods, acting as the first-ever baseline on
the proposed dataset for non-parametric 3D garment retar-
geting.

35,FusedRF: Fusing Multiple Radiance Fields,"Abstract
Radiance Fields (RFs) have shown great potential to rep-
resent scenes from casually captured discrete views. Com-
positing parts or whole of multiple captured scenes could
greatly interest several XR applications. Prior works can
generate new views of such scenes by tracing each scene in
parallel. This increases the render times and memory re-
quirements with the number of components. In this work,
we provide a method to create a single, compact, fused RF
representation for a scene composited using multiple RFs.
The fused RF has the same render times and memory utiliza-
tions as a single RF. Our method distills information from
multiple teacher RFs into a single student RF while also fa-
cilitating further manipulations like addition and deletion
into the fused representation."
35,Interactive Segmentation of Radiance Fields,"Abstract
Radiance Fields (RF) are popular to represent casually-
captured scenes for new view synthesis and several ap-
plications beyond it.
Mixed reality on personal spaces
needs understanding and manipulating scenes represented
as RFs, with semantic segmentation of objects as an im-
portant step. Prior segmentation efforts show promise but
don’t scale to complex objects with diverse appearance.
We present the ISRF method to interactively segment ob-
jects with fine structure and appearance. Nearest neighbor
feature matching using distilled semantic features identifies
high-confidence seed regions. Bilateral search in a joint
spatio-semantic space grows the region to recover accu-
rate segmentation. We show state-of-the-art results of seg-
menting objects from RFs and compositing them to another
scene, changing appearance, etc., and an interactive seg-
mentation tool that others can use."
35,StyleTRF: Stylizing Tensorial Radiance Fields,"ABSTRACT
Stylized view generation of scenes captured casually using a camera
has received much attention recently. The geometry and appear-
ance of the scene are typically captured as neural point sets or
neural radiance fields in the previous work. An image stylization
method is used to stylize the captured appearance by training its
network jointly or iteratively with the structure capture network.
The state-of-the-art SNeRF [29] method trains the NeRF and styl-
ization network in an alternating manner. These methods have
high training time and require joint optimization. In this work, we
present StyleTRF, a compact, quick-to-optimize strategy for stylized
view generation using TensoRF [6]. The appearance part is fine-
tuned using sparse stylized priors of a few views rendered using
the TensoRF representation for a few iterations. Our method thus
effectively decouples style-adaption from view capture and is much

35,Neural View Synthesis with Appearance Editing from Unstructured Images,"ABSTRACT
We present a neural rendering framework for simultaneous view
synthesis and appearance editing of a scene with known envi-
ronmental illumination captured using a mobile camera. Existing
approaches either achieve view synthesis alone or view synthesis
along with relighting, without control over the scene’s appearance.
Our approach explicitly disentangles the appearance and learns a
lighting representation that is independent of it. Specifically, we
jointly learn the scene appearance and a lighting-only represen-
tation of the scene. Such disentanglement allows our approach to
generalize to arbitrary changes in appearance while performing
view synthesis. We show results of editing the appearance of real
scenes in interesting and non-trivial ways. The performance of our
view synthesis approach is on par with state-of-the-art approaches
on both real and synthetic data.

36,Machine learning-optimized relay selection method for mitigating interference in next generation communication networks,"Abstract
In an effective Wireless Network (WN), low latency and reliability are essential to provide adequate infrastructure for better
communication. Cooperative Communication is one efﬁcient way to achieve these wireless network goals. In this research, the
machine learning-based Decode and Forward (DF) coding was developed in conjunction with the network coding algorithm to
improve cooperative communication and system functionality that select relays which will not cause interference in a wireless
network. Here, the Interference-Thwarting Relay Selection (ITRS) technique is intended to aid reliable communication while
reducing self-interference. It is possible to monitor and measure suitable relays in the communication process with the help of a
machine learning system. Thus, the proposed Interference-Thwarting Relay Selection technique is implemented with the
parameters like Bit Error Rate (BER) as 10-6, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as 36 dB, Symbol Error Rate (SER) as 10-8 and
throughput with the power allocation factors. The simulated Machine Learning-Optimized Relay Selection Method (ML-
ORSM) results achieve the improved optimal power allocation with symbol error rate."

PTZ-Camera-Based Facial Expression 
Analysis using Faster R-CNN for Student 
Engagement Recognition 
E. Komagal and B. Yogameena 
Abstract During the pandemic, online classes are predominated. However, the new 
normal needs effective analysis of students’ classroom engagement. Ofﬂine classes 
also have a potential threat to students’ engagement before and especially after 
the post-covid. Facial Expressions Analysis has become essential in the learning 
environment, whether it is online or ofﬂine. The ofﬂine classroom environment is 
considered a problem environment. Since, it can be easily adapted to the online 
environment. Notably, in the PTZ camera environment, the recognition becomes 
more challenging due to varying face poses, limited Field-of-View (FOV), illumi-
nation conditions, effects of the continuous pan, zoom-in, and zoom-out. In this 
paper, facial expression-based student engagement analysis in a classroom environ-
ment is proposed. Face detection has been achieved by YOLO (You only look once) 
detector to ﬁnd multiple faces in the classroom with maximum speed and accu-
racy. Consequently, by adopting the Ensemble of Robust Constrained Local Models 
(ERCLM) method, landmark points are localized in detected faces even in occlusion, 
and therefore, feature matching is performed. Besides, the matched landmark points 
are aligned by an afﬁne transformation. Finally, having different expressions, the 
aligned faces are fed as input to Faster R-CNN (Faster Regions with Convolutional 
Neural Network). It recognizes behavioral activities such as Attentiveness (Zero-In 
(ZI)), Non-Attentiveness (NA), Day Dreaming (DD), Napping (N), Playing with 
Personal Stuff in Private (PPSP), and Talking to the Students’ Behind (TSB). The 
proposed approach is demonstrated using the TCE classroom datasets and Online 
datasets. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.

36,Enhanced Disease Identification Model for Tea Plant Using Deep Learning,"Abstract: Tea plant cultivation plays a signiﬁcant role in the Indian economy. The
Tea board of India supports tea farmers to increase tea production by preventing
various diseases in Tea Plant. Various climatic factors and other parameters cause
these diseases. In this paper, the image retrieval model is developed to identify
whether the given input tea leaf image has a disease or is healthy. Automation
in image retrieval is a hot topic in the industry as it doesn’t require any form
of metadata related to the images for storing or retrieval. Deep Hashing with Inte-
grated Autoencoders is our proposed method for image retrieval in Tea Leaf
images. It is an efﬁcient and ﬂexible way of retrieving Tea Leaf images. It has
an integrated autoencoder which makes it better than the state-of-the-art methods
giving better results for the MAP (mean average precision) scores, which is used
as a parameter to judge the efﬁciency of the model. The autoencoders used with
skip connections increase the weightage of the prominent features present in the
previous tensor. This constitutes a hybrid model for hashing and retrieving images
from a tea leaf data set. The proposed model will examine the input tea leaf image
and identify the type of tea leaf disease. The relevant image will be retrieved
based on the resulting type of disease. This model is only trained on scarce data
as a real-life scenario, making it practical for many applications."
36,Classification of clustered health care data analysis using generative adversarial networks (GAN),"Abstract
Innovation and adoption of new technologies in health care industries produce vast data every day. The diverse data in
health care include clinical data, health history, and genetic data. Also, real-time monitoring in health care generates huge
data, and efﬁciently examining these big data is a challenging task. Analysis of health care data becomes more important so
that proper medications can be provided and issues can be reduced by taking proper precautions based on the history. Data
analysis becomes efﬁcient because of automation, however, due to data integrity, data diversity, and inconsistency, the
performance gets lagged. Various machine learning models are introduced to handle big data management; however,
researchers are still working to attain a better model with improved accuracy. So with the objective to attain maximum
classiﬁcation accuracy, fuzzy c means clustering and generative adversarial network are employed in this research work for
health care data clustering and classiﬁcation. Benchmark lung cancer dataset and Arrhythmia dataset are used in the
experimentation. The proposed model exhibits the maximum accuracy of 97.8% for dataset 1 and 98.6% for dataset 2
compared to existing techniques like support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms."
36,Multi-Domain Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Ancient Urdu Text Recognition System,"Abstract: Deep learning has achieved magniﬁcent success in the ﬁeld of pattern
recognition. In recent years Urdu character recognition system has signiﬁcantly
beneﬁted from the effectiveness of the deep convolutional neural network. Major-
ity of the research on Urdu text recognition are concentrated on formal handwrit-
ten and printed Urdu text document. In this paper, we experimented the
Challenging issue of text recognition in Urdu ancient literature documents. Due
to its cursiveness, complex word formation (ligatures), and context-sensitivity,
and inadequate benchmark dataset, recognition of Urdu text from the literature
document is very difﬁcult to process compared to the formal Urdu text document.
In this work, ﬁrst, we generated a dataset by extracting the recurrent ligatures
from an ancient Urdu fatawa book. Secondly, we categorized and augment the
ligatures to generate batches of augmented images that improvise the training efﬁ-
ciency and classiﬁcation accuracy. Finally, we proposed a multi-domain deep
Convolutional Neural Network which integrates a spatial domain and a frequency
domain CNN to learn the modular relations between features originating from the
two different domain networks to train and improvise the classiﬁcation accuracy.
The experimental results show that the proposed network with the augmented
dataset achieves an averaged accuracy of 97.8% which outperforms the other
CNN models in this class. The experimental results also show that for the recog-
nition of ancient Urdu literature, well-known benchmark datasets are not appro-
priate which is also veriﬁed with our prepared dataset."
36,A Cloud-Based Secure Emergency Message Dissemination Scheme in Vehicular Adhoc Networks,"Abstract: The Internet of vehicles and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) offers
numerous opportunities for managing the transportation problems effectively. The
high mobility and wireless communication in VANET lead to adequate network
topology modiﬁcations, resulting in network instability and insecure data commu-
nication. With an unsteady ﬂow of trafﬁc, vehicles are unevenly distributed in the
geographical areas in practice. A new type 2 fuzzy logic-based secure clustering
(T2FLSC) with cloud-based data dissemination scheme called the T2FLSC-CDD
model for the VANET has been introduced for resolving this issue. The vehicles
are dynamically clustered by the use of the T2FLSC technique, which elects the
CHs (Cluster Head) by the use of different parameters, namely, travelling speed
(TS), link quality (LQ), trust factor (TF), inter-vehicle distance (IVD) and neigh-
boring node count (NCC). The inclusion of the trust factor helps to select the
proper CHs for the secure data dissemination process. Once the CHs are selected,
a cloud connection can broadcast the Emergency messages to every vehicle. To
save the location details of the vehicles in the cloud securely, the Blowﬁsh tech-
nique has also been implemented in this work. For validating the effectiveness of
the T2FLSC-CDD model, an extensive results analysis has been performed with
respect to various measures. The attained simulation outcomes have pointed out
that the proposed model has achieved maximum packet delivery ratio (PDR)
and throughput with minimum key computation time (KCT), routing control
overhead (RCO), time delay (TD), and key recovery time (KRT)."

utilizing face veils have become a significant piece of our lives.  
To evade the spread of contamination Individuals are urged to 
cover their faces using a mask when in open territory. The 
utilization of these face veils makes the orthodox facial 
recognition system inadequate for authentication in school/office

A number of new technologies have been designed for cooperative communication due to the advancement in wireless 
communication. High throughput, data rates and high quality of service are required by current generation like 4G and future 
generation like 5G wireless communication. MIMO antennas have few limitations like hardware complexity, resource 
requirements when it uses simplex or half duplex mode of operations. To overcome its drawback like self interference, the outage 
performance analysis of Two way full duplex (FD) decode and forward relay system is carried out by considering residual self 
interference caused due to the mode called FD  when compared to traditional analysis with perfect self interference cancellation.  
This article investigated the outage performance of a two way network with decode and forward technique in the presence of 
multi interferers at the source and or destination terminals.  Anyway, it was not taken into account in the previous research papers 
due to the strong self interference (SI) which occurred from the transmitting antenna (Tx) to the local receiving antenna (Rx). The 
SI has been highly eliminated using various self interference cancellation (SIC) techniques. To improve the outage performance, 
further optimal power allocation schemes and optimal relay node placement strategies are proposed. Then, simulation results are 
shown for symmetrical and asymmetrical situations.

37,Discovery of 6G Services and Resources in Edge-Cloud-Continuum,"Abstract—The advent of 6G networks will present a pivotal
juncture in the evolution of telecommunications, marked by
the proliferation of devices, dynamic service requests, and the
integration of edge and cloud computing. In response to these
transformative shifts, this paper proposes a service and resource
discovery architecture as part of service provisioning for the
future 6G edge-cloud-continuum. Through the architecture’s
orchestration and platform components, users will have access
to services efficiently and on time. Blockchain underpins trust in
this inherently trustless environment, while semantic networking
dynamically extracts context from service requests, fostering
efficient communication and service delivery. A key innovation
lies in dynamic overlay zoning, which not only optimizes resource
allocation but also endows our architecture with scalability,
adaptability, and resilience. Notably, our architecture excels
at predictive capabilities, harnessing learning algorithms to
anticipate user and service instance behavior, thereby enhanc-
ing network responsiveness and preserving service continuity.
This comprehensive architecture paves the way for unparalleled
resource optimization, latency reduction, and seamless service
delivery, positioning it as an instrumental pillar in the unfolding
6G landscape. Simulation results show that our architecture
provides near-optimal timely responses that significantly improve
the network’s potential, offering scalable and efficient service and
resource discovery."
37,"Semantic Revolution from Communications to Orchestration for 6G: Challenges, Enablers, and Research Directions","Abstract—In the context of emerging 6G services, the re-
alization of everything-to-everything interactions involving a
myriad of physical and digital entities presents a crucial chal-
lenge. This challenge is exacerbated by resource scarcity in
communication infrastructures, necessitating innovative solutions
for effective service implementation. Exploring the potential
of Semantic Communications (SemCom) to enhance point-to-
point physical layer efficiency shows great promise in addressing
this challenge. However, achieving efficient SemCom requires
overcoming the significant hurdle of knowledge sharing between
semantic decoders and encoders, particularly in the dynamic
and non-stationary environment with stringent end-to-end quality
requirements. To bridge this gap in existing literature, this paper
introduces the Knowledge Base Management And Orchestration
(KB-MANO) framework. Rooted in the concepts of Computing-
Network Convergence (CNC) and lifelong learning, KB-MANO
is crafted for the allocation of network and computing resources
dedicated to updating and redistributing KBs across the system.
The primary objective is to minimize the impact of knowledge
management activities on actual service provisioning. A proof-of-

with resource allocation in radio access networks. Finally, the
paper offers insights into future research directions, emphasizing
the transformative potential of semantic-oriented communication

37,Cross-Cluster Networking to Support Extended,"Abstract—Extented Reality (XR) refers to a class of contem-
porary services that are intertwined with a plethora of rather
demanding Quality of Service (QoS) and functional requirements.
Despite Kubernetes being the de-facto standard in terms of
deploying and managing contemporary containerized microser-
vices, it lacks adequate support for cross-cluster networking,
hindering service-to-service communication across diverse cloud
domains. Although there are tools that may be leveraged along-
side Kubernetes in order to establish multi-cluster deployments,
each one of them comes with its drawbacks and limitations.
The purpose of this article is to explore the various potential
technologies that may facilitate multi-cluster deployments and to
propose how they may be leveraged to provide a cross-cluster
connectivity solution that caters to the intricacies of XR services.
The proposed solution is based on the use of two open source
frameworks, namely Cluster API for multi-cluster management,
and Liqo for multi-cluster interconnectivity. The efficiency of this
approach is evaluated in the context of two experiments. This
work is the first attempt at proposing a solution for supporting
multi-cluster deployments in a manner that is aligned with the
requirements of XR services."
37,Optical Air-Gap Attacks: Analysis and IoT Threat Implications,"Abstract—Since 2008, the Korean government has instituted
network separation technology, which physically isolates external
internet networks from internal networks, aiming to thwart
cyber-attacks. Consequently, the domestic financial sector was
largely unaffected during global crises (2017 WannaCry ran-
somware outbreak and the 2021 Log4j vulnerability incident).
However, there exist certain vulnerabilities owing to the pre-
sumption of their relative safety against cyber intrusions and the
integration of cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in
the current smart revolution. The existing network separation
measures only mitigate one facet of potential cyber threats,
rendering a comprehensive defense elusive. The rise of “air-
gap” attacks, which exploit the isolated space between closed
and external networks to illicitly transfer data and the existing
research primarily substantiating the potential for data breaches
from closed networks to their external counterparts are problems
yet to be addressed. Thus, our study proposed a tangible optical
air-gap attack methodology, harnessing readily available optical
mediums within closed networks. Intricate measurement metrics
that consider vital factors of the transmission environment were
proposed. Moreover, acknowledging the proliferating integration
of IoT devices, such as smart bulbs, to facilitate automation
within closed networks, this study demonstrated the viability of
optical air-gap attacks using these devices."

stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transi-
tion to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspi-
cious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-
based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness
in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the
Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually
changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this
paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an
autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted
for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources,
catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent
requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities:
state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature
of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs
dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system
states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges
posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed,
classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated
ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two
functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen
by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The
paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse
scenario to exemplify ACNC’s role in resource provisioning with
Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC’s workflow, details
a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes
with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for

37,CLOCIS: Cloud-Based Conformance Testing Framework for IoT Devices in the Future Internet,"Abstract: In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has not only become ubiquitous in daily life but
has also emerged as a pivotal technology across various sectors, including smart factories and smart
cities. Consequently, there is a pressing need to ensure the consistent and uninterrupted delivery of
IoT services. Conformance testing has thus become an integral aspect of IoT technologies. However,
traditional methods of IoT conformance testing fall short of addressing the evolving requirements
put forth by both industry and academia. Historically, IoT testing has necessitated a visit to a testing
laboratory, implying that both the testing systems and testers must be co-located. Furthermore, there
is a notable absence of a comprehensive method for testing an array of IoT standards, especially given
their inherent heterogeneity. With a surge in the development of diverse IoT standards, crafting an
appropriate testing environment poses challenges. To address these concerns, this article introduces
a method for remote IoT conformance testing, underpinned by a novel conceptual architecture
termed CLOCIS. This architecture encompasses an extensible approach tailored for a myriad of
IoT standards. Moreover, we elucidate the methods and procedures integral to testing IoT devices.
CLOCIS, predicated on this conceptual framework, is actualized, and to attest to its viability, we
undertake IoT conformance testing and present the results. When leveraging CLOCIS, small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entities in the throes of IoT service development stand to
beneﬁt from a reduced time to market and cost-efﬁcient testing procedures. Additionally, this
innovation holds promise for IoT standardization communities, enabling them to champion their

37,Towards Semantic Smart Cities: A Study on the Conceptualization and Implementation of Semantic Context Inference Systems,"Abstract: Smart cities provide integrated management and operation of urban data emerging within
a city, supplying the infrastructure for smart city services and resolving various urban challenges.
Nevertheless, cities continue to grapple with substantial issues, such as contagious diseases and
terrorism, that pose severe ﬁnancial and human risks. These problems sporadically arise in vari-
ous locales, and current smart city frameworks lack the capability to autonomously identify and
address these issues. The challenge intensiﬁes especially when trying to recognize and respond to
unprecedented problems. The primary objective of this research is to predict potential urban issues
and support their resolution proactively. To achieve this, our system makes use of semantic reasoning
to understand the ongoing situations within the city. In this process, the 5W1H principles serve as
inference rules, guiding the extraction and consolidation of context. Firstly, utilizing domain-speciﬁc
annotation templates, we craft a semantic graph by amalgamating information from various sources
available in the city, such as municipal public data and IoT platforms. Subsequently, the system
autonomously infers and accumulates contexts of situations occurring in the city using 5W1H-based
reasoning. As a result, the accumulated contexts allow for inferring potential urban problems by
identifying repeated disruptions in city services at speciﬁc times or locations and establishing connec-
tions among them. The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a comprehensive conceptual
model for the suggested system and presenting actual implementation cases and applicable use cases.
These contributions facilitate awareness among city administrators and citizens within a smart city
regarding potential problem-prone areas or times, thereby aiding in the preemptive identiﬁcation
and mitigation of urban challenges."
37,"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL, VOL. 11, NO. 8, 15 APRIL 2024 13467","Abstract—Advancements in deep learning and the Internet
of Things (IoT) enable early ﬁre detection through vision-
based systems, reducing ecological, social, and economic damage.
These systems necessitate lightweight, cost-effective convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs) for real-time operation. Effective
deployment on AI-assisted edge devices is crucial for optimal
performance. To mitigate this problem, we present the optimized
ﬁre attention network (OFAN) for effective and efﬁcient ﬁre
detection. In the reengineered attention block, we swapped the
convolution layers by dilated variants and integrated additional
dense layers to capture global context and reﬁne more weight
optimization. We calibrate the OFAN for real-time processing
using a lightweight and efﬁcient feature extractor backbone
model. Additionally, a challenging ﬁre data set is a critical
contribution that contains extremely diverse, blazing, and nonﬁre,
captured in lighting and foggy environments. It advances tradi-
tional ﬁre detection samples by considering low-light and foggy
conditions. A comprehensive experiment is conducted over three
widely used ﬁre detection data sets, and our proposed OFAN out-
performs state-of-the-art. The proposed OFAN achieved 96.23%,
96.54%, and 94.63% accuracies over BoWFire, FD and the newly
proposed DiverseFire data set, respectively. Our research sets a
standard for ﬁre detection over edge devices, offering improved

37,Toward 6G-Based Metaverse: Supporting Highly-Dynamic Deterministic Multi-User Extended Reality Services,"Abstract
Metaverse is the concept of a fully immersive 
and universal virtual space for multiuser interac-
tion, collaboration, and socializing; forming the 
next evolution of the Internet. Metaverse depends 
on the convergence of multiple broad technolo-
gies that enable eXtended Reality (XR), which is 
an umbrella term for technologies that lie on the 
reality–virtuality continuum, namely Virtual Reality 
(VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality 
(MR). Compared to streaming volumetric content 
to a single user, the XR applications that involve 
multiple users who simultaneously watch the same 
volumetric content (e.g., VR-based online train-
ing/education and multi-user online gaming) are 
much more attractive. Multi-user XR/Metaverse 
puts additional demand on the underlying net-
works, making it more difficult to offer high-qual-
ity immersive material in real-time. To cope with 
this, in this article, we present a comprehensive 
system and component design for immersive and 
seamless multi-user XR experiences. To satisfy the 
Quality of Experience/Quality of Service (QoE/
QoS) requirements and especially stream syn-
chronization requirement in XR collaboration sce-
narios, we propose an AI-powered deterministic 
multi-user extended reality resource orchestrator 
(PRECISENESS) that aims to solve the multi-user XR 
service provisioning problem. Finally, we demon-
strate the performance of our proposed solution in 
a single-site multi-user XR use case. The obtained 
results demonstrate that our solution can deliver 
high-quality immersive XR services."
37,An Analysis of Network Performance Requirements for Industrial IoT Services based on 5G Non-Public Network in Smart Energy,"Abstract—In the overall fifth generation (5G) network 
market, the 5G Non-Public Network (NPN) market is expected 
to grow on a large scale. The telecommunications market will 
transition from being operator-led to being more driven by 5G 
NPNs. This suggests that enterprises and industries will 
increasingly opt for their own private networks, providing them 
greater control and customization over their network operations. 
By 2035, the 5G NPN market is expected to dominate the 
traditional operator-led market. This signifies the scale and 
impact of the digital transformation and Industry 4.0, where 
advanced networking and connectivity become increasingly 
critical. In particular, we emphasize the need for 5G NPNs for 
substations, indicating that these critical infrastructures could 
greatly benefit from the robust, reliable, and low-latency 
communication offered by 5G NPN. This can help improve the 
operational efficiency, safety, and data accuracy of these sites. 
The use of 5G NPN, coupled with advanced technologies like AI 
and 
Digital 
Twins, 
can 
significantly 
aid 
the 
digital 
transformation of substations and other facilities in the smart 
energy sector. These technologies can help with real-time 
monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimization of these 
facilities, leading to improved operations and sustainability."
37,Transparent Rule Enablement Based on Commonization Approach in Heterogeneous IoT Edge Networks,"Abstract: The paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing brings a number of
heterogeneous devices to the network edge for monitoring and controlling the environment. For
reacting to events dynamically and automatically in the environment, rule-enabled IoT edge platforms
operate the deployed service scenarios at the network edge, based on ﬁltering events to perform
control actions. However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT edge networks, deploying a consistent
rule context for operating a consistent rule scenario on multiple heterogeneous IoT edge platforms
is difﬁcult because of the difference in protocols and data formats. In this paper, we propose a
transparent rule enablement, based on the commonization approach, for enabling a consistent rule
scenario in heterogeneous IoT edge networks. The proposed IoT Edge Rule Agent Platform (IERAP)
deploys device proxies to share consistent rules with IoT edge platforms without considering the
difference in protocols and data formats. Therefore, each device proxy only considers the translation
of the corresponding platform-speciﬁc and common formats. Also, the rules are deployed by the
corresponding device proxy, which enables rules to be deployed to heterogeneous IoT edge platforms
to perform the consistent rule scenario without considering the format and underlying protocols of
the destination platform."
38,Interpreting Deep Neural Networks for Medical Imaging using Concept Graphs,"Abstract
The black-box nature of deep learning models prevents
them from being completely trusted in domains like
biomedicine. Most explainability techniques do not cap-
ture the concept-based reasoning that human beings fol-
low. In this work, we attempt to understand the behavior
of trained models that perform image processing tasks
in the medical domain by building a graphical repre-
sentation of the concepts they learn. Extracting such a
graphical representation of the model’s behavior on an
abstract, higher conceptual level would help us to un-
ravel the steps taken by the model for predictions. We
show the application of our proposed implementation
on two biomedical problems - brain tumor segmenta-
tion and fundus image classiﬁcation. We provide an al-
ternative graphical representation of the model by for-
mulating a concept level graph as discussed above, and
ﬁnd active inference trails in the model. We work with
radiologists and ophthalmologists to understand the ob-
tained inference trails from a medical perspective and
show that medically relevant concept trails are obtained
which highlight the hierarchy of the decision-making
process followed by the model. Our framework is avail-
able at https://github.com/koriavinash1/

In this work, we implement and examine a new flow reconstruction methodology using cubic-splines for inter-
polations in the gas kinetic method (GKM). We compare this version of GKM with the existing WENO based 
interpolation method. The comparisons are made in terms of accuracy and computational speed. We find that 
at low to intermediate range of Mach number (Mt < 0.7), cubic-splines based interpolations are superior in terms 
of reduced numerical dissipation and higher computational speed (7x faster) as compared to the WENO 
interpolation method."
38,Distributed physics informed neural network for data-ecient solution to,"Abstract
The physics informed neural network (PINN) is evolving as a viable method to solve partial diﬀerential equa-
tions. In the recent past PINNs have been successfully tested and validated to ﬁnd solutions to both linear
and non-linear partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs). However, the literature lacks detailed investigation of
PINNs in terms of their representation capability. In this work, we ﬁrst test the original PINN method in
terms of its capability to represent a complicated function. Further, to address the shortcomings of the PINN
architecture, we propose a novel distributed PINN, named DPINN. We ﬁrst perform a direct comparison
of the proposed DPINN approach against PINN to solve a non-linear PDE (Burgers’ equation). We show
that DPINN not only yields a more accurate solution to the Burgers’ equation, but it is found to be more
data-eﬃcient as well. At last, we employ our novel DPINN to two-dimensional steady-state Navier-Stokes
equation, which is a system of non-linear PDEs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst such
attempt to directly solve the Navier-Stokes equation using a physics informed neural network."
38,Towards a unified framework for developing ethical and practical Turing tests,"Abstract Since Turing proposed the ﬁrst test of intelli-
gence, several modiﬁcations have been proposed with the
aim of making Turing’s proposal more realistic and
applicable in the search for artiﬁcial intelligence. In the
modern context, it turns out that some of these deﬁnitions
of intelligence and the corresponding tests merely measure
computational power. Furthermore, in the framework of
the original Turing test, for a system to prove itself to be
intelligent, a certain amount of deceit is implicitly required
which can have serious security implications for future
human societies. In this article, we propose a uniﬁed
framework for developing intelligence tests which takes
care of important ethical and practical issues. Our proposed
framework has several important consequences. Firstly, it
results in the suggestion that it is not possible to construct a
single, context independent, intelligence test. Secondly,
any measure of intelligence must have access to the process
by which a problem is solved by the system under con-
sideration and not merely the ﬁnal solution. Finally, it
requires an intelligent agent to be evolutionary in nature
with the ﬂexibility to explore new algorithms on its own."
38,Prediction of transition in temporal mixing layer using ILES,"Abstract In this paper, we study the capability of implicit
large eddy simulation (ILES) to capture transition. In
particular, we study a planar temporal mixing layer sub-
jected to low free stream perturbations. We simulated this
problem by ILES and other approaches like Reynolds
averaged Navier Stokes simulation (RANS), conventional
large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simula-
tion (DNS). Qualitative and quantitative assessment of
their relative performance reveals the advantage of ILES
over
other methods. We
propose that
any
scheme,
upwinding in this case, will be successful in simulating
such ﬂows if the discrete dispersion relationship of the
linearized equation is similar to the theoretical dispersion
relation. To verify our conjecture, we derived discretized
dispersion relationship with upwinding and central differ-
ence scheme for a simple prototype of Navier Stokes
equation namely complex Ginzburg Landau equation
(CGLE). We found that the two relations and thus pertur-
bation growth are signiﬁcantly different from each other
for, at least, convection dominated ﬂows."
38,Enhanced Image Classiﬁcation With Data,"Abstract—In this paper we propose the use of image pixel
position coordinate system to improve image classiﬁcation
accuracy in various applications. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize
that the use of pixel coordinates will lead to (a) Resolution
invariant performance. Here, by resolution we mean the spacing
between the pixels rather than the size of the image matrix. (b)
Overall improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy in comparison
with network models trained without local pixel coordinates.
This is due to position coordinates enabling the network to
learn relationship between parts of objects, mimicking the
human vision system. We demonstrate our hypothesis using
empirical results and intuitive explanations of the feature maps
learnt by deep neural networks. Speciﬁcally, our approach
showed improvements in MNIST digit classiﬁcation and beats
state of the results on the SVHN database. We also show that
the performance of our networks is unaffected despite training
the same using blurred images of the MNIST database and
predicting on the high resolution database."
38,Stability analysis of the carbuncle phenomenon and the sonic point glitch,"Abstract.
Upwinding allows for accurate, non-oscillatory capturing of shocks waves; however, many Rie-
mann solvers (both exact and approximate) suffer from some sort of numerical instability. One of the most
mysterious and least understood of these is the carbuncle phenomenon. In the present study, we analyse the

38,Fully discrete finite element scheme for nonlocal parabolic problem involving the Dirichlet energy,"Abstract In this article we present a ﬁnite element scheme for solving a nonlocal
parabolic problem involving the Dirichlet energy. For time discretization, we use
backward Euler method. The nonlocal term causes difﬁculty while using Newton’s
method. Indeed, after applying Newton’s method we get a full Jacobian matrix due to
the nonlocal term. In order to avoid this difﬁculty we use the technique given by Gudi
(SIAM J Numer Anal 50(2):657–668, 2012) for elliptic nonlocal problem of Kirchhoff
type. We discuss the well-posedness of the weak formulation at continuous as well
as at discrete levels. We also derive a priori error estimates for both semi-discrete
and fully discrete formulations. Results based on the usual ﬁnite element method are
provided to conﬁrm the theoretical estimates."
38,doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2006.05.027,"Abstract
During the past decade gas-kinetic methods based on the BGK simpliﬁcation of the Boltzmann equation have been
employed to compute ﬂuid ﬂow in a ﬁnite-diﬀerence or ﬁnite-volume context. Among the most successful formulations
is the ﬁnite-volume scheme proposed by Xu [K. Xu, A gas-kinetic BGK scheme for the Navier–Stokes equations and
its connection with artiﬁcial dissipation and Godunov method, J. Comput. Phys. 171 (48) (2001) 289–335]. In this paper
we build on this theoretical framework mainly with the aim to improve the eﬃciency and convergence of the scheme, and
extend the range of application to three-dimensional complex geometries using general unstructured meshes. To that end
we propose a modiﬁed BGK ﬁnite-volume scheme, which signiﬁcantly reduces the computational cost, and improves the
behavior on stretched unstructured meshes. Furthermore, a modiﬁed data reconstruction procedure is presented to remove
the known problem that the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the BGK equation ﬁxes the Prandtl number at unity. The new
Prandtl number correction operates at the level of the partial diﬀerential equations and is also signiﬁcantly cheaper for
general formulations than previously published methods. We address the issue of convergence acceleration by applying
multigrid techniques to the kinetic discretization. The proposed modiﬁcations and convergence acceleration help make
large-scale computations feasible at a cost competitive with conventional discretization techniques, while still exploiting
the advantages of the gas-kinetic discretization, such as computing full viscous ﬂuxes for ﬁnite volume schemes on a simple
two-point stencil.

38,OPT2020: 12th Annual Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning,"Abstract
There is a renewed interest in exploring the application of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs)
to solve Differential equations. One of the popular methods is Physics informed Neural Net-
works(PINNs), which embeds the knowledge of the equation itself into the loss function of the
Neural-Network. The traditional PINNs use Multi-layer ANNs (MLNNs) and employ Gradient-
Descent type optimization algorithms like Adam/L-BFGS-B to optimize the weights of the ANN.
In this paper, we explore the well-known Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) Optimization algorithm to
optimize the weights of a Single-layer Neural Network (SLNN) based PINNs. We show that for a
class of problems known as Singular Perturbation Problems (SPPs), our method can achieve much
more accurate solutions, much faster, than the Traditional PINNs. The prevalent research on ANNs
mostly focuses on the architecture and the data. Based on our observations, we establish that the
choice of weight optimization algorithms are as important as the other two and need due consider-
ation."

40,Analysis and Design Considerations for Achieving the Fundamental Limits of Phase Noise in mmWave Oscillators With On-Chip MEMS Resonator,"Abstract—Very small electromechanical coupling coefﬁcient
in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) or acoustic res-
onators is quite a concern for oscillator performance, specially at
mmWave frequencies. This small coefﬁcient is the manifestation
of the small ratio of motional capacitance to static capacitance
in the resonators. This work provides a general solution to
overcome the problem of relatively high static capacitance at
mmWave frequencies and presents analysis and design techniques
for achieving extremely low phase noise and a very high ﬁgure-
of-merit (FoM) in an on-chip MEMS resonator based mmWave
oscillator. The proposed analysis and techniques are validated
with design and simulation of a 30 GHz oscillator with MEMS
resonator having quality factor of 10,000 in 14 nm GF technol-
ogy. Post layout simulation results show that it achieves a phase
noise of −132 dBc/Hz and FoM of 217 dBc/Hz at offset of 1 MHz."

emerging 
Narrowband 
Human 
Body 
Communication (NB-HBC) technology, as well as MedRadio 
communication in the 400 MHz band promise better energy 
efficiencies than traditional Bluetooth Low Energy for wireless 
body area networks (WBAN) due to lower channel losses and 
lower frequencies, respectively. Although HBC offers less than 
10pJ/bit energy efficiencies, it strictly demands both the 
transmitter and receiver to be on the body. Traditional 
MedRadio enables data transfer even when either devices are not 
on the body, but consumes orders of magnitude more energy 
than HBC, primarily due to large power consumption in LO 
generation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a 
COntext-aware, Reconfigurable transmitter (COR-Tx) consisting 
sub-3pJ/bit HBC and sub-5pJ/bit MedRadio modes (both state-of-
the-art), while supporting opportunistic switching between the two 
modes depending on the location of the receiver (on-body/off-
body) for achieving optimum system-level energy with seamless 
communication.  For 10 Mbps data rate, the HBC mode achieves 
an energy efficiency of 2.24pJ/bit, while the MedRadio mode 
achieves 4.93pJ/bit using a shared LO generation scheme that 
utilizes direct-modulated edge combination (EC) for minimizing 
energy consumption. The energy-efficiency improvement over 
the state-of-the-art is ~2.1X for HBC and ~90X for MedRadio."
40,Noise‐power‐area optimised design procedure for OTAs with complementary input transistors for neural amplifiers,"Abstract: Simultaneous measurement of neural bio-potentials from a large number of neurons is finding applications in a
diverse range of areas such as healthcare and brain-machine interfacing. Neural amplifiers used for these measurements have
a tight specification of low-power, low-noise and small area. Most of the reported neural amplifiers use operational
transconductance amplifier (OTA) based capacitive feedback amplifiers to meet these requirements. In this study, for the first
time, a novel systematic noise-power-area optimised design procedure, for complementary input transistor based OTAs, used
frequently in neural amplifiers is proposed. By applying the proposed design procedure, the authors have presented a neural
amplifier design that is split into two stages to reduce area requirement and enhance linearity at the expense of slight
degradation in noise efficiency factor. The presented design achieves 2.1 μVrms noise in the integration bandwidth of 0.2 Hz–8 
kHz with 7.7 μA total current in a die area of 355 μm × 175 μm in 180 nm CMOS technology. The presented design procedure is
inherently technology agnostic. The novelty lies not in the architecture of the proposed neural amplifier, but in the proposed
design procedure to optimise the noise-power-area trade-off in CMOS amplifier circuit design.

complete receiver chain at Medical Device Radio Communication
(MedRadio) band in 401-406 MHz frequency range. Supported
by detailed quantitative explanations, the proposed measurement
methods help in characterizing the LNA without duplicating
it on the chip only for the characterization and promises to
save experimental time and cost. A common source inductively
degenerated LNA has been designed and fabricated in 180 nm
mixed mode CMOS technology. The measurement results show
that the LNA consumes 700 µW power while giving a voltage
gain of 31 dB, S11<-14 dB and noise ﬁgure of 5.8 dB at 400 MHz
frequency. Complete receiver chain measurements with this LNA
conﬁrms the results from the proposed methods."

modulated signal, which is transmitted from a body worn device
in the MedRadio spectrum of 401-406 MHz. The front-end
comprises a low noise ampliﬁer (LNA), a zero crossing detector
(ZCD) and a frequency to digital converter (FDC). The proposed
architecture offers direct digitization of the input signal and
is immune to LO leakage and problem of image frequencies.
Designed in 180 nm mixed mode CMOS technology, the worst
case post layout simulation results show a sensitivity of -80 dBm
at 200 kbps for FSK modulated input with only 990 µW power
consumption.

41,The Smart Sustainable Development of Automation Mobility in Industry 4.0 using IoT based Sensor Networks,"Abstract—Industry 4.0, also called the 4th Commercial 
Revolution, is characterized
by mixing advanced digital 
technologies into production and automation strategies. As part 
of this revolution, the development of automation mobility has 
grown to be an important aspect in accomplishing clever and
sustainable increases in business sectors. The use of net of 
factors (IoT) primarily based sensor networks has been tested to 
be a key solution in driving this development. Automation 
mobility refers to the capacity of machines and gadgets to move 
and operate autonomously in the manufacturing technique. 
Through this automation is made extra wireless and powerful 
by leveraging IoT-based sensor networks. These sensor 
networks allow real-time information collection, analysis, and
communiqué among machines, allowing them to make smart 
decisions and adapt to converting environments."
41,Study of Traffic Simulation Model for Heterogeneous Traffic,"Abstract—Mixed-mode traffic, with its diverse vehicle types
and varying attributes, holds substantial significance compared to
homogeneous traffic scenarios. While homogeneous traffic com-
prises vehicles with similar characteristics, mixed-mode traffic
mirrors real-world road complexities, including cars, trucks, rick-
shaws, motorcycles, and more. Recognizing the value of mixed-
mode traffic fosters comprehensive and realistic transportation
planning tailored to each vehicle type’s unique needs. In our
study, we analyzed macroscopic parameters like traffic flow,
speed, and density using the SUMO traffic simulator, affirming
its efficacy for modeling mixed-mode traffic. As, the car-following
parameters of mixed-mode traffic have been manually tuned
in our study for SUMO. So, it opens up possibilities for using
machine learning models to predict the parameters for further
improvements."
41,QoS-Aware Task Migration Strategy for Fog IoT,"Abstract—IoT applications generate a lot of time-sensitive data
that needs to be analyzed. Several fog-integrated cloud platforms
are available to process these data.
The task’s significance
degrades if IoT tasks are not completed within the specified
time frame. Many task allocation algorithms that meet Quality of
Service (QoS) requirements have been proposed in the literature.
However, due to network bandwidth variation, VM failure, and
processing delay variation, the fog node may not always be
able to complete the task before the deadline. In this case, it
is required to migrate the task from one fog node to another
and complete it before the deadline. We proposed a QoS-
aware TAsk Migration (QoTAM) algorithm that identifies the
candidate task and its eligible fog node for migration. When the
performance of QoTAM is compared to that of the existing task
allocation technique, we find that QoTAM has a 10% higher task
completion ratio.

41,Generating Realistic Synthetic Traffic Data using Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Abstract— Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are a set
of technologies that can be used to improve the efficiency, safety,
and sustainability of transportation systems. One of the key
challenges in ITS is data sparsity. One of the main reasons
for data sparsity in ITS is the high cost of maintaining and
deploying ITS infrastructure. To overcome the data sparsity is-
sue, researchers have proposed different approaches to generate
synthetic traffic data, such as employing traffic simulators or
statistical methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
are a powerful class of deep learning models that excel in
generating synthetic data that exhibits the characteristics and
found patterns in the training data, particularly in the domains
of images and text.
In this paper, we discuss the data sparsity challenge in ITS and
present our pioneering use of Conditional Tabular Generative
Adversarial Networks (CTGANs) to generate synthetic traffic
data. It takes into account the conditional dependencies among
columns in the dataset, enabling the generation of samples that
respect the relationships and patterns observed in the real data.
In the field of ITS, the application of CTGANs is unexplored.
While CTGANs have been used in other domains such as
intrusion detection systems and network traffic analysis, their
utilization in ITS is novel and unprecedented. CTGANs offer
the potential to generate fine-grained and realistic data, making
them valuable for creating accurate simulation setups in ITS.
We evaluate our approach using a range of real-world traffic
datasets and demonstrate that our method produces realistic
and accurate synthetic traffic data. Additionally, we assess the
generalization capability of our synthetic data, finding that it
exhibits strong performance on unseen data.

41,Modelling and Analysis of Walk and Intelligent Feeder Service Based Last Mile Connectivity to Metro Stations,"Abstract— Last mile connectivity refers to the critical link
that connects commuters from their homes or workplaces to
the nearest public transportation hubs, enhancing accessibility
and reducing reliance on private vehicles. Existing last mile
connectivity solutions to access public transportation often face
limitations such as limited coverage areas, inefficient routing
and lack of integration with different modes, poor quality
of service for commuters, hindering seamless and efficient
commuting experience.
In this paper, an intelligent feeder service is designed to
enhance last mile connectivity to metro stations. An online
algorithm is developed to recommend suitable boarding junc-
tions for commuters to join shared rides. The algorithm also
assists vehicles in navigating the road network by suggesting
starting junctions, en route stops, and diversions that maximize
the likelihood of picking up commuters, while satisfying the
constraints related to the walk distance and additional time
required in a shared ride. The performance of proposed system
is evaluated for the amount of walking, travel time and waiting
time of commuters, and the vehicle occupancy using large scale
numeric simulations. The simulation results are encouraging
and demonstrate better qualitative performance of the proposed
service than other typical feeder or shuttle services.

41,Hybrid deep learning models for traffic stream variables prediction during rainfall,"abstract representation using layerwise architecture. 
The impact of weather conditions on traﬃc is dependent on various hidden features. The rainfall 
eﬀect on traﬃc is not directly proportional to the distance between the weather station and the 
road because of terrain feature constraints. The prolonged rainfall weakens the drainage system, 
aﬀects soil absorption capability, which causes waterlogging. Therefore, to capture the spatial 
and prolonged impact of weather conditions, we proposed a soft spatial and temporal threshold 
mechanism. To ﬁll out the missing weather data spatial interpolation techniques are used. 
The traﬃc condition on a target road depends on the surrounding area’s traﬃc and weather con- 
ditions and relies on its own traﬃc characteristics. We designed the hybrid deep learning models, 
CNN-LSTM and LSTM-LSTM. The former model in the hybrid model extracts the spatiotemporal 
features and the latter model uses these features as memory. The latter model predicts the traﬃc 
stream variables depending upon the passed features and temporal input. 
We perform multiple experiments to validate the deep learning model’s performance. The ex- 
periments show that a deep learning model trained with traﬃc and rainfall data gives better 
prediction accuracy than the model trained without rainfall data. The performance of the LSTM- 
LSTM model is better than other models in extracting long-term dependency between the traﬃc 
and weather data."

Data management solutions are becoming increasingly necessary as more Big Data applications are developed.
One such area that deals with Big Data is Big Graphs. Complex relationships exist in graph-based applica-
tions. Analytics and data extraction are better solutions for understanding such complex applications. Data
from Avian Science has shown signiﬁcant growth in recent years. Graph analytics can be used to interpret
complex scientiﬁc data and their relationships. This paper uses graph analytics to discuss the application of
graph analytics in avian science. For the eBird Dataset, four Graph Analytics techniques were identiﬁed and
implemented. These methods extract information about path patterns, node popularity, connections to other
nodes, and clustering. The Dataset includes real-time data on bird observation and distribution. Each analytics
technique extracts data from the birds’ observations. The ﬁndings show that graph analytics for avian science
data can aid in predicting a wide range of crowd-sourced information. Additionally, the work can be expanded

41,QoS-Aware Task Allocation and Scheduling in Three-Tier,"Abstract:
There is a lot of time-sensitive data provided by IoT applications that needs to be analysed. A Fog-Integrated
Cloud Architecture is available to process these data. Due to the QoS requirements of IoT applications, the
perishable nature of fog cloud resources, and the competition among users and service providers, task alloca-
tion in such an architecture is challenging. In this paper, we propose a competitive bidding (CompBid) strategy
and a QoS-based task allocation and scheduling (QoTAS) algorithm using double auctions that aim to max-
imize user and service provider proﬁt while also satisfying QoS requirements. A remote patient monitoring
system is used to compare QoTAS performance to that of two previous studies, DPDA and MADA. In both
the truthful and CompBid strategies, QoTAS achieves a higher task allocation ratio and resource utilization
than DPDA and MADA. It has 89% more system utility than DPDA and 54% more user utility than MADA.
Furthermore, the CompBid strategy increases QoTAS system utility by 25%.

41,Online Task Allocation and Scheduling in Fog IoT using Virtual Bidding,"Abstract—IoT applications increasingly exceed the available
computing capacity at the edge. A 3-tier fog architecture may
allow for low-latency compute-intensive applications. However,
resource allocation in the cloud and fog, along with real-time
application requirements, pose a number of challenges. In this
paper, we examine the problem of auction-based resource alloca-
tion for delay-sensitive online IoT applications in the cloud-fog-
edge architecture. We propose a multi-attribute double auction-
based task allocation algorithm with delay-based pricing and
bidding strategy. A novel virtual-bidding mechanism is designed
to allocate resources to tasks that arrive in-between the bidding
rounds. The price and winners are determined using McAfee
and reserved price-based allocation, which also considers the
perishable nature of fog/cloud resources. The proposed algorithm
is implemented in NetSim and Python. We find a substantive
performance boost in resource utilization when virtual bidding
is used for online jobs instead of only using periodic auctions.
Simulation results show an increase of 61% in resource utilization,
37% in user utility, and 79% in profit for fog service providers."
41,A Multi-modal Ride Sharing Framework for Last Mile Connectivity,"Abstract—Public transportation can provide efficient and eco-
nomical mode of commute in a region. It can address the problem
of traffic congestion and relevant issues of pollution and accidents.
However, commuters find it difficult to access public transport
because of the issues related to the first / last mile connectivity,
and prefer the costly personalized mode of transport due to its
flexibility and comfort.
In this paper, we propose a multi-modal ride sharing frame-
work for providing last mile connectivity to the public trans-
port users. The integrated framework offers users the most
appropriate mode of commute or the mixture of them for
the first / last mile connectivity. The functional components
of the framework are described along with the infrastructure
requirement for a large scale deployment. In particular, the
communication protocols, and the distributed computing model
are elaborated. Finally, the challenges and operational issues that
needs to be addressed for a successful deployment of the system
are highlighted."
41,Modelling and Simulation of Road Traffic Under Rainy Conditions,"Abstract—The Rainfall reduces the visibility on roads and
pavement friction, which in turn increases accident risk and
reduces the vehicle speed. Further, in countries where the
drainage system is not proper, water collects on the streets,
resulting in waterlogging, lane obstruction and the partial or
complete submersion of lanes.
In this paper, we study the effect of rainfall on trafﬁc mobility
using two parameters - rainfall intensity and waterlogging on the
road. We conducted an image-based survey to study the drivers’
perception about vehicle speed under varying rainy conditions.
A total of 151 people participated in the survey. Using the trafﬁc
survey data, we designed two regression models - linear and
quadratic - that represent the vehicle speed as a function of
rainfall intensity and the depth of waterlogging on road. We
integrated these models into the Krauss car-following model of
the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) to simulate the effect
of rainfall on the roadway trafﬁc. The simulation results show
a very good match with the trafﬁc survey data. We observe the
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.8% and"
41,An Empirical Study on Parameters Affecting Traffic Stream Variables Under Rainy Conditions,"Abstract—Inclement weather condition such as rainfall greatly
affects the traffic stream variables. To study the impact of
rainfall on vehicle mobility, fine-grained data is required which
is provided by the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
infrastructure and weather stations. As the installation and
maintenance of ITS infrastructure are costly, the majority of
traffic data collection is carried out using cost-effective alternate
sources such as cellular networks and GPS probes. These
alternate sources of traffic data provide sparse, incomplete, and
erroneous information. To overcome the issue of data sparsity, we
propose a mechanism to generate fine-grained synthetic traffic
data using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). It is found
that a large number of weather parameters affect traffic mobility
in the region. We design a generic empirical model that captures
the impact of rainfall intensity, road type, friction, visibility index,
and the time of day on the traffic stream variables. The designed
empirical model is integrated into the Krauss car-following model
of SUMO. The simulation model is validated using the traffic data
reported in the literature under rainy conditions. We find that
the synthetic data generated using the proposed empirical model
matches well with the traffic data reported in the literature."

In this century of automation, automation, which is digitised and more and more technology is applied, 
makes people's lives easier. When individuals feel unsafe on the Internet, they are less likely to use it, 
which is the situation currently. When it comes to gadgets and sensors, the “Internet of Things” IoT has 
made this possible. There has been an increase in the production of compact, low-cost sensors as a result 
of advances in sensor technology. Temperature, pressure, vibration, sound, and light are a few examples 
of sensors that may be utilized in the Internet of Things. Increasingly powerful IoT applications are being 
developed as a consequence of the continuous improvement of IoT sensors with each new generation. As 
a result, discussing their security concerns and risks might be difficult. There are several advantages and 
disadvantages to IT applications that are discussed in this article. One-hundred-and-ninety-nine percent 
of the papers analyzed considered cost the most important consideration when assessing IoT 
applications, followed by real-tameness (64 percent) and security and error (57 percent). DDoS assaults, 
an in-depth look into DDoS assaults on IoT devices, the consequences of DDoS attacks, and mitigation 
methods are presented in this article. Detection models for DDoS assaults are compared in this review 
article, which focuses on Intrusion Detection models. Also given were several IDS classifications, multiple

41,Impact of Rainfall and Waterlogging on Traffic Stream Variables in Developing Countries,"Abstract—Adverse weather conditions like fog, snow, and
rainfall affect the driver’s visibility, road capacity, and vehicles’
mobility. The impact of rainfall on the trafﬁc stream variables
- trafﬁc ﬂow and speed - is mainly studied for arterial roads
of developed countries. These studies use the ﬁne-grain data
of trafﬁc and weather collected by Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) and weather stations. In developing countries,
limited ITS infrastructure is available for trafﬁc monitoring, and
the available trafﬁc data are very sparse. The prolonged heavy
rain causes massive waterlogging in developing countries due to
weak drainage systems, narrow roads, and encroachments.
In this paper, we study the impact of rainfall on the trafﬁc
stream variables on the arterial, sub-arterial, and collector roads.
An empirical model is designed and calibrated for a variety
of trafﬁc (peak, off-peak, night) and weather conditions (low,
moderate, heavy, prolonged heavy rainfall, and waterlogging). To
address the issue of sparse trafﬁc data, we generate synthetic data
using the SUMO-"
41,Macroscopic Traffic Stream Variables Prediction with Weather Impact Using Hybrid CNN-LSTM model,"ABSTRACT
Accurate prediction of the macroscopic traffic stream variables
such as speed and flow is important for traffic operation and man-
agement in an intelligent transportation system. Adverse weather
conditions like fog, snow, and rainfall affect the driver’s visibility,
road capacity, and mobility. The accurate prediction of the traffic
stream variables in adverse weather conditions is challenging be-
cause of the non-linear and complex characteristics of the traffic
stream and spatiotemporal correlation between traffic and weather
variables. Prolonged heavy rain causes massive waterlogging in
developing countries due to weak drainage systems, narrow streets,
and encroachment, further affecting these traffic stream variables.
Snow reduces the road capacity as much as waterlogging does. Pro-
longed snowfall creates a thick layer on the road, which affects the
traffic stream variables. Traffic data has a high spatial and temporal
resolution compared to weather data, which makes the problem
more challenging. In this paper, we define a soft temporal threshold
to capture the prolonged impact of weather variables. To capture
the traffic and weather data’s spatiotemporal and temporal features,
we propose a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. To validate model perfor-
mance, data from San Diego and Minneapolis Minnesota Twin city
are used. The test experiments show that the hybrid CNN-LSTM
model learns spatiotemporal and temporal features accurately com-
pared to other deep learning models.

41,Macroscopic Traffic Stream Variable Prediction with Weather Impact using Recurrent Learning Approach,"Abstract—Accurate
prediction
of
the
macroscopic
trafﬁc
stream variables such as speed and ﬂow is important for
trafﬁc operation and management in an intelligent transportation
system. The accurate prediction of these variables is challenging
because of the non-linear and complex characteristics of the
trafﬁc stream. With recent computational technologies and huge
data availability, such a problem is solved using data-driven
approaches. Traditional data-driven approaches use shallow
architecture which ignores the hidden inﬂuencing factor and
proved to have limitations in a high dimensional trafﬁc state.
Adverse weather conditions like fog, wind, rainfall, and snowfall
affect the visibility of the driver, mobility of vehicle and road
capacity. We examine the effect of rainfall on trafﬁc stream
variable prediction. The deep learning approaches use a layered
architecture to extract the inherent features in the data. In this
paper, recurrent neural network(RNN) and its variant long short
term memory(LSTM) are used and their accuracy of predicting
the trafﬁc stream variables with and without rainfall variable
is studied. To validate model performance, trafﬁc sensor data
from an arterial road and rainfall data from weather stations
in San Diego are used for model training and testing. The test
experiments show that with the combination of trafﬁc data and
rainfall data, recurrent learning models give better prediction
accuracy over the model without rainfall data. Also, the LSTM
outperforms other deep learning models in the presence of
rainfall data."
41,Task Allocation in Three Tier Fog IoT Architecture for Patient Monitoring System using Stackelberg Game and Matching Algorithm,"Abstract—Internet of Things (IoT) based personalized health
monitoring system typically generates large amount of critical
data that need to be analyzed and acted upon in real-time. Fog
computing architecture has been proposed to handle this class
of low-latency applications. Task allocation and scheduling on
the fog nodes while satisfying stringent time constraint is a
difﬁcult problem that has been studied only in simple cases [1]
[2]. In this paper, we propose a distributed optimization model
for task allocation to fog nodes which can handle periodic
as well as sporadic task allocation that maximize the utility
of all the nodes participating in task execution process while
satisfying delay constraint from the tasks. We have extended
the heuristic based on Stackelberg game and matching algo-
rithm [3] to handle sporadic and heterogeneous tasks as well.
Proposed algorithm has been simulated with realistic health
monitoring application parameters. Results show signiﬁcant
improvement over the existing algorithm.

42,Optimised Mission Planning for Heterogeneous Uncrewed Vehicle Teams,"ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a new mission planning optimisation method for coverage missions
involving Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) and Ground Vehicles (GV) to minimize the mission
planning time and the UAS and GV route length. Optimal planning of paths for the UAS
and GV using the Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), often struggles with computational

To overcome the MILP computational issues, we present a reinforcement learning technique based
on rollout policy optimisation called as Multi-Agent Rollout Policy Optimisation (MARPO).
Through simulations, we showcase MARPO’s ability to match the precision of conventional MILP
formulation in small instances and excel in scalability and computational efficiency in larger cases.
Additionally, MARPO is compared with a heuristic method, Multi-Agent Greedy Path-Finding
Algorithm (MAGPA), and the superior performance of MARPO in terms of total path length
and computational efficiency is demonstrated. Several simulations are presented to showcase the
advantages of MARPO. In simulations with 1 UAS and 1 UGV, MARPO achieved path lengths

42,Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-RL) for,"Abstract— Autonomous Vehicle (AV) decision-making in ur-
ban environments is inherently challenging due to the dynamic
interactions with surrounding vehicles. For safe planning,
AV/ego must understand the weightage of various spatiotem-
poral interactions in a scene. Contemporary works use colos-
sal transformer architectures to encode interactions mainly
for trajectory prediction, resulting in increased computational
complexity. To address this issue without compromising spa-
tiotemporal understanding and performance, we propose the
simple Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-
RL) framework, which dynamically assigns and incorporates
the significance of surrounding vehicles into the ego’s RL-driven
decision-making process. We introduce an AV-centric spatio-
temporal attention encoding (STAE) mechanism for learning
the dynamic interactions with different surrounding vehicles.
To understand map and route context, we employ a context
encoder to extract features from context maps. The spatio-
temporal representations combined with contextual encoding
provide a comprehensive state representation. The resulting
model is trained using the Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm.
We evaluate the proposed framework on the SMARTS urban
benchmarking scenarios without traffic signals to demonstrate
that DAD-RL outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the importance
of the context-encoder and spatio-temporal attention encoder
in achieving superior performance.

42,Decentralized Connectivity Maintenance for Multi-Agent Systems Using Control Barrier Functions,"Abstract— This paper proposes a decentralized control bar-
rier function (CBF) as a solution for distributed global con-
nectivity maintenance for a multi-agent system (MAS). Using
a combination of Fiedler value estimation (the second smallest
eigenvalue of the Laplacian) and control barrier functions, the
proposed method can ensure that agents will remain globally
connected in a distributed fashion. The major advantage of
using CBF is that it allows us to consider multiple objectives
and constraints at the same time. Moreover, it enables the agent
connectivity to be increased to a desired level. Mathematical
analysis and simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the
approach.

moving planar non-holonomic target with unknown constant
body fixed linear velocity and arbitrary angular motion. We
propose a novel target velocity estimator augmented kinematic
controller based on appropriately derived feature dynamics in
a virtual image plane. Through a comprehensive theoretical
analysis based on the Lyapunov direct method, we prove the
convergence of feature tracking errors to zero for translational
kinematics and to an ultimate bound for rotational kinematics
despite the unknown target motion and parameter uncertainty
in desired feature depth. The theoretical claims are validated
using model-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop (SITL) simu-
lations.

42,Multi-AAV Cooperative Path Planning Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control With Localization Constraints,"Abstract— In this paper, we solve a joint cooperative localiza-
tion and path planning problem for a group of Autonomous
Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) in GPS-denied areas using nonlinear
model predictive control (NMPC). A moving horizon estimator
(MHE) is used to estimate the vehicle states with the help of
relative bearing information to known landmarks and other
vehicles. The goal of the NMPC is to devise optimal paths for each
vehicle between a given source and destination while maintaining
desired localization accuracy. Estimating localization covariance
in the NMPC is computationally intensive; hence, we develop
an approximate analytical closed-form expression based on the
relationship between covariance and path lengths to landmarks.
Using this expression while computing NMPC commands reduces
the computational complexity significantly. We present numerical
simulations to validate the proposed approach for different
numbers of vehicles and landmark configurations. We also
compare the results with EKF and RRT* based methods to show
the superiority of the proposed closed-form approach."

article
presents
a
deep
reinforcement
learning-based approach to tackle a persistent surveillance
mission requiring a single unmanned aerial vehicle initially
stationed at a depot with fuel or time-of-flight constraints to
repeatedly visit a set of targets with equal priority. Owing
to the vehicle’s fuel or time-of-flight constraints, the vehicle
must be regularly refueled, or its battery must be recharged
at the depot. The objective of the problem is to determine
an optimal sequence of visits to the targets that minimizes
the maximum time elapsed between successive visits to any
target while ensuring that the vehicle never runs out of fuel or
charge. We present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm
to solve this problem and present the results of numerical
experiments that corroborate the effectiveness of this approach
in comparison with common-sense greedy heuristics.

42,"Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Persistent Monitoring With Sensing, Communication, and Localization Constraints","Abstract— Determining multi-robot motion policies for persis-
tently monitoring a region with limited sensing, communication,
and localization constraints in non-GPS environments is a
challenging problem. To take the localization constraints into
account, in this paper, we consider a heterogeneous robotic system
consisting of two types of agents: anchor agents with accurate
localization capability and auxiliary agents with low localization
accuracy. To localize itself, the auxiliary agents must be within
the communication range of an anchor, directly or indirectly. The
robotic team’s objective is to minimize environmental uncertainty
through persistent monitoring. We propose a multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL) based architecture with graph
convolution called Graph Localized Proximal Policy Optimization
(GALOPP), which incorporates the limited sensor field-of-view,
communication, and localization constraints of the agents along
with persistent monitoring objectives to determine motion policies
for each agent. We evaluate the performance of GALOPP
on open maps with obstacles having a different number of
anchor and auxiliary agents. We further study 1) the effect of
communication range, obstacle density, and sensing range on the
performance and 2) compare the performance of GALOPP with
area partition, greedy search, random search, and random search
with communication constraint strategies. For its generalization
capability, we also evaluated GALOPP in two different environ-
ments – 2-room and 4-room. The results show that GALOPP
learns the policies and monitors the area well. As a proof-of-
concept, we perform hardware experiments to demonstrate the
performance of GALOPP.
Note to Practitioners—Persistent monitoring is performed in
various applications like search and rescue, border patrol, wildlife

monitoring, etc. Typically, these applications are large-scale, and
hence using a multi-robot system helps achieve the mission
objectives effectively. Often, the robots are subject to limited
sensing range and communication range, and they may need
to operate in GPS-denied areas. In such scenarios, developing
motion planning policies for the robots is difficult. Due to the lack
of GPS, alternative localization mechanisms, like SLAM, high-
accurate INS, UWB radio, etc. are essential. Having SLAM or a
highly accurate INS system is expensive, and hence we use agents
having a combination of expensive, accurate localization systems
(anchor agents) and low-cost INS systems (auxiliary agents)
whose localization can be made accurate using cooperative
localization techniques. To determine efficient motion policies,
we use a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique
(GALOPP) that takes the heterogeneity in the vehicle localization
capability, limited sensing, and communication constraints into
account. GALOPP is evaluated using simulations and compared
with baselines like random search, random search with ensured
communication, greedy search, and area partitioning. The results
show that GALOPP outperforms the baselines. The GALOPP
approach offers a generic solution that be adopted with various
other applications.

42,Graph-Based Prediction and Planning Policy Network (GP3Net) for Scalable Self-Driving in Dynamic Environments Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract
Recent advancements in motion planning for Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) show great promise in using expert driver
behaviors in non-stationary driving environments. However,
learning only through expert drivers needs more generaliz-
ability to recover from domain shifts and near-failure sce-
narios due to the dynamic behavior of traffic participants
and weather conditions. A deep Graph-based Prediction and
Planning Policy Network (GP3Net) framework is proposed
for non-stationary environments that encodes the interactions
between traffic participants with contextual information and
provides a decision for safe maneuver for AV. A spatio-
temporal graph models the interactions between traffic par-
ticipants for predicting the future trajectories of those par-
ticipants. The predicted trajectories are utilized to generate a
future occupancy map around the AV with uncertainties em-
bedded to anticipate the evolving non-stationary driving en-
vironments. Then the contextual information and future oc-
cupancy maps are input to the policy network of the GP3Net
framework and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm. The proposed GP3Net performance is eval-
uated on standard CARLA benchmarking scenarios with do-
main shifts of traffic patterns (urban, highway, and mixed).
The results show that the GP3Net outperforms previous state-
of-the-art imitation learning-based planning models for dif-
ferent towns. Further, in unseen new weather conditions,
GP3Net completes the desired route with fewer traffic infrac-
tions. Finally, the results emphasize the advantage of includ-
ing the prediction module to enhance safety measures in non-
stationary environments."
42,Tracking a Planar Target Using Image-Based Visual Servoing Technique,"Abstract—In this paper, we design and validate a kinematic
controller for a quadrotor tracking a planar moving target using
image-based visual servoing (IBVS). Most of the current literature
on IBVS for moving targets often consider restrictive assump-
tions on the target dynamics that limits its generalizability for
any arbitrary motion. We propose a model-free target velocity
estimator augmented kinematic controller based on appropriately
derived feature dynamics in a virtual image plane. We show how
the inner-loop mismatch affects the kinematic controller perfor-
mance through a comprehensive theoretical analysis based on the
Lyapunov direct method. We prove that the system errors converge
exponentially to an ultimate bound in general and asymptotically to
zero for the purely translational and constant target motions and
vanishing inner-loop mismatch. Extensive simulations, including
model-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop settings, along with
experimental validation in an outdoor environment, conﬁrm the
utility of the proposed visual servoing technique."
42,Adversarial Fragmentation of Robotic Teams Operating Under Reynolds&#x0027; Rules with Bounded Communication Radius,"Abstract— In this paper, we examine a class of counter-swarm
problems featuring small teams of antagonists. The objective of
the counter-swarm algorithm is to minimize the connectivity of
the team using a single adversarial pursuer. We devise a novel
criterion for the connectivity of an undirected graph, based on
an augmentation of its Laplacian. We prove theoretically how
the criterion depends on the size and the connectivity of the
graph. Next, we pose optimal control problems which use this
criterion as well as the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. We show
how the properties of the team dynamics and their interaction
with the pursuer deﬁne an envelope within which the pursuer
achieves the desired objectives.

42,A Comprehensive Study on Modelling and Control of Autonomous,"Abstract. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have become the de facto vehicle for remote
operations involving oceanography, inspection, and monitoring tasks. These vehicles operate
in different and often challenging environments; hence, the design and development of the
AUV involving hydrodynamics and control systems need to be designed in detail. This book
chapter presents a study on the modelling and robust control of a research vehicle in the
presence of uncertainties. The vehicle’s dynamic behaviour is modelled using a 6-degree-of-
freedom approach, considering the effect of ocean currents. The level flight requirements for
different speeds are derived, and the resulting model is decomposed into horizontal and vertical
subsystems for linear analysis.
The simulation results presented focus on the efficacy of linear controllers within three key sub-
systems: depth, yaw, and speed. Moreover, level-flight outcomes are demonstrated for a speed
of 4 knots. The nonlinear control strategies employed in this study encompass conventional
and sliding-mode control (SMC) methodologies. To ensure accurate tracking performance, the
controller design considers the vehicle’s dynamics with various uncertainties such as ocean cur-
rents, parameter uncertainty, CG (Center of Gravity) deviation and buoyancy variation. Both
conventional and nonlinear SMC controllers’ outcomes are showcased with a lawn-mowing ma-
noeuvre scenario. A systematic comparison is drawn between the robustness of SMC against
disturbances and parameter fluctuations in contrast to conventional controllers. Importantly,
these results underscore the trade-off that accompanies SMC’s robustness, as it necessitates a
higher level of complexity in terms of controller design, intricate implementation intricacies,
and the management of chattering phenomena."

42,Cooperative Control Strategies for Autonomous Agents Using Nonlinear,"Abstract
Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) are extensively used in civilian and military applications like aerial
surveying, search and rescue, transportation, border patrolling, etc. In most applications, achieving the
objectives using a single AAV is difficult. Hence, multiple cooperative AAVs are used to accomplish
the mission quickly and efficiently. However, achieving cooperation is challenging in real-world scenar-
ios due to the uncertainties in obtaining other vehicle states (position, velocity, etc.) and measurement
information. The constraints, such as limited sensor range and availability, noises, and environmental
disturbances, must be handled properly to obtain an efficient system. In this thesis, we provide solutions
for a three-agent and four-agent pursuit-evasion problem, path planning under localization constraints,
and tracking ground vehicles for cinematography purposes. The optimal control commands for the coop-
erative agents in each of these problems are found using the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
framework. We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed solutions and show the performance
through numerical simulations. Brief explanations of the proposed solutions are given in the following
paragraphs.
Chapter 2 presents a cooperative target defense guidance strategy using a nonlinear model predictive
control (NMPC) framework for a target-attacker-defender (TAD) problem. The TAD problem consists
of an attacker and a cooperative target-defender pair. The attacker’s objective is to capture the target,
whereas the target-defender team acts together such that the defender can intercept the attacker and
ensure target survival. We assume that the cooperative target-defender pair do not have perfect knowledge
of the attacker states, and hence the states are estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The
capture analysis based on the Apollonius circles is performed to identify the target survival regions. The
efficacy of the NMPC-based solution is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations, and hardware
experiments performed using ground rovers. We also compare our approach against previous studies,
iv
which use the command to line of sight (CLOS), and augmented command to line of sight (A-CLOS)
guidance strategies.
Chapter 3 presents a cooperative target defense strategy using nonlinear model-predictive control
(NMPC) framework for a two–target two–attacker (2T2A) problem. Each attacker needs to capture a
designated target individually. The objective of the two targets is to cooperate such that they lure the
two attackers into a collision. We assume that the targets do not have perfect knowledge of the attacker
states, and hence they estimate the attacker states using EKF. The NMPC scheme computes closed-loop
optimal control commands for the targets while satisfying state and control constraints. Theoretical
analysis is carried out to determine escape regions that will lead to the targets’ survival or capture.
Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed NMPC-based strategy
for different scenarios validating the theoretical results.
From Chapters 2 and 3, we observe that the NMPC-based solution offers robustness to the different
unknown attacker models and has better performance than the CLOS and A-CLOS based strategies.
With the help of escape zone maps, it is now possible to identify the outcome of the games beforehand.
Also, the experimental results proved that the proposed online-feedback scheme is a suitable alternative
to conventional optimal control techniques for real-world scenarios.
In Chapter 4, we solve a joint cooperative localization and path planning problem for a group of
autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The vehicles do
not have access to global satellite navigation systems (GNSS). A moving horizon estimator (MHE) is
used to estimate the states with the help of relative bearing information to known landmarks and other
vehicles. The goal of NMPC is to devise optimal paths for each vehicle between a given source and
destination while maintaining desired localization accuracy. The localization error covariance of the
vehicles for the NMPC prediction window was calculated using an approximate analytical expression
based on the relation between the covariance and path lengths to the landmarks. We show that a ve-
hicle’s position accuracy is inversely proportional to the path length to the landmarks. The use of this
analytical expression reduces the computation requirement of NMPC compared to the traditional method
of propagating and estimating covariances using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Finally, we present
numerical simulation results that validate the proposed approach for different numbers of vehicles and
landmark configurations. The proposed framework is useful in the area of urban mobility, where many
v
autonomous aerial vehicles fly through urban areas with buildings and other structures performing tasks
such as cargo delivery. The proposed framework allows these AAVs to localize themselves cooperatively
in the absence of GNSS signals since, in urban canyons, the accuracy of GNSS is affected by phenomena
such as multipath.
In Chapter 5, we introduce a learning-based nonlinear model predictive control (L-NMPC) scheme
for the iterative task of filming race cars using gimbaled cameras mounted on autonomous aerial vehicles
(AAVs). The controller is capable of avoiding inter-vehicle collisions and the environmental obstacles
that block the path of the AAVs. It also ensures that the cars always lie in the field of views (FOVs)
of the cameras while satisfying the control and state constraints. The controller is able to learn from
the previous iterations and improve the tracking performance with the help of reinforcement learning
(RL). Simulation results are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning-based control
scheme. The proposed scheme helps reduce manual effort in tuning weights for the cost components of
the NMPC. Also, with the help of RL-tuned weights, the NMPC scheme gives tight tracking of the cars
even in environments containing obstacles.
Finally, in Chapter 6, we conclude the thesis by providing the inferences from the various experi-
ments and simulations for different problems discussed in Chapters 2-5. The main extensions for the
NMPC framework discussed in the thesis are to broaden the framework to three dimensions taking the
terrain map and urban environments into account. The current NMPC solver suffers from a high value
of computation time for such complex environments with a large number of agents. Hence, for real-
time implementation, we would like to drive our approach toward the use of fast-MPC based solvers for
speeding up the computations. In the future, we would like to use the actual dynamics for the agents
instead of point-mass models. Also, environmental challenges like wind disturbances could be taken
into effect when formulating the control law for the agents. A detailed description of future directions
for each problem is given at the end of this chapter.
In summary, this thesis focuses on developing solutions for different applications – pursuit- evasion
games, path planning under uncertainty, and cinematography using the NMPC framework. We analyze
the theoretical properties of the proposed solution and show the performance through simulations and
experiments.

42,Dynamic Image-Based Visual Servoing for Quadrotor to Track a Planar Target with Unknown Motion,"Abstract— This paper presents an image-based visual ser-
voing (IBVS) technique for a quadrotor to track a moving
planar target having unknown linear and angular velocities.
Image moment-based features are derived after transforming
the optical measurements to a virtual image plane parallel
to the planar target. The kinematic controller is designed
incorporating the linear and angular target velocity estimator
blocks. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the errors
converge exponentially to an ultimate bound for time-varying
target motion and exponentially to zero if the target motion
is purely translational with constant velocity. Unlike past
literature, the proposed IBVS scheme can handle unknown
arbitrary translational and angular (along the z-axis) motions
of the target in a unified and model-free manner. Simulation
results using circular and Liassajous target motion are provided

42,CAMEL: Learning Cost-maps Made Easy for Off-road Driving,"Abstract— Cost-maps are used by robotic vehicles to plan
collision-free paths. The cost associated with each cell in the
map represents the sensed environment information which is
often determined manually after several trial-and-error efforts.
In off-road environments, due to the presence of several types of
features, it is challenging to handcraft the cost values associated
with each feature. Moreover, different handcrafted cost values
can lead to different paths for the same environment which
is not desirable. In this paper, we address the problem of
learning the cost-map values from the sensed environment for
robust vehicle path planning. We propose a novel framework
called as CAMEL using deep learning approach that learns the
parameters through demonstrations yielding an adaptive and
robust cost-map for path planning. CAMEL has been trained on
multi-modal datasets such as RELLIS-3D. The evaluation of
CAMEL is carried out on an off-road scene simulator (MAVS)
and on ﬁeld data from IISER-B campus. We also perform real-
world implementation of CAMEL on a ground rover. The results
shows ﬂexible and robust motion of the vehicle without collisions

layed healing. These bacteria can exacerbate wound conditions,
hindering natural healing and potentially leading to infections. The
electrochemical sensing platform presented in this study serves as a
valuable tool for healthcare professionals to make timely and targeted
treatment decisions. Toward this, we developed a cost-effective elec-
trochemical sensing platform leveraging the TLR4/MD-2 complex to
detect gram −ve bacterial colonies. Our biosensors were meticulously
fashioned using polyaniline (PANi) and hollow PANi (HPANi) nanoﬁbers. Notably, the HPANi-based sensors, owing to
their distinctive hollow structure, facilitated ampliﬁed responses under comparable experimental conditions compared
with PANi-based counterparts. The designed sensing platform demonstrated exceptional accuracy in identifying Es-
cherichia coli (gram −ve), showcasing a theoretical detection limit of 0.215 CFU/mL for PANi and a remarkably improved
0.14 CFU/mL for HPANi. These sensors displayed outstanding selectivity for gram −ve bacteria, even amidst gram +ve
bacteria and fungi. Moreover, our platform demonstrated remarkable sensitivity, yielding 3.04 ((R/R)/CFU/mL)/cm2
for the HPANi-based sensor, surpassing the performance of the PANi-based sensor at"
43,An ultrasensitive and selective PPY-fMWCNT nanocomposite electrical-transducer based Chemiresistive immunosensing platform for early detection of Alzheimer&#x0027;s,"Abstract — Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form 
of dementia associated with progressive loss of neuronal cells due 
to progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (AB/Aβ) peptides in 
plaque form. Early diagnosis is the key to effective AD treatment, 
which can be carried out by detecting Aβ 1-40 (AB40) and Aβ 1-42 
(AB42) potential biomarkers in easily accessible body fluids at sub 
pico gram per mL. With this aim, we have developed carboxylic 
functionalized 
multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes 
(fMWCNTs) 
embedded Polypyrrole (PPY) nanocomposite (PPY-fMWCNT) 
based highly sensitive and selective chemiresistive immunosensing 
platform that has the potential to detect multiple analytes 
simultaneously on the same substrate at sub femto gram per mL 
range. The binding event of antibody and antigen was transduced in 
terms of normalized resistance of bioelectrodes, measured through 
a four-probe probe station. By using PPY-fMWCNT as a 
bioelectrical transducer, the proposed sensing platform detected 
AB40 peptides (in real-time human plasma samples) in the linear 
detection range of 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with a very low limit of 
detection (LoD) and a high sensitivity of 0.564 fg/mL and 55.67 
((ΔR/R0)/ng.mL-1)/cm2, respectively. The sensitivity of bare PPY 
(18.44 ((ΔR/R0)/ng.mL-1)/cm2) compared 
with 
fMWCNTs 
embedded PPY sensing platform enhanced 2.02 times without 
compromising in LoD. The analytical performance of the platform 
is further evaluated in terms of selectivity, repeatability and 
interference, posing its significance in the early detection of AD."

In this study we have reported the design and development of a facile, sensitive, selective, and label-free
electrochemical sensing platform for the detection of atrazine based on MWCNT-embedded ZnO nanoﬁbers.
Electrospun nanoﬁbers were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron
microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), UV-Visible spectroscope (UV-VIS),
and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR). Electrochemical properties of MWCNT-ZnO nanoﬁber-modiﬁed
electrodes were assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Binding
event of atrazine to anti-atrazine antibody, which immobilized on nanoﬁber-modiﬁed electrode via EDC and NHS
chemistry, was transduced with EIS. Due to high conductivity, surface area, and low bandgap of MWCNT-ZnO
nanoﬁbers, we have achieved the sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD) of sensor as 2"

44,SOT-MRAM-Based Design for Energy-Efficient and Reliable Binary Neural Network Acceleration,"Abstract— Binary neural networks (BNNs) are a highly
promising option for realizing lightweight and efficient
computing for applications on the edge. Spin-orbit torque
MRAM (SOT-MRAM) has emerged as an attractive option
for realizing fast and energy-efficient design. In this work,
we propose a 4T-2R memory cell using viable and exper-
imentally demonstrated SOT magnetic tunnel junction
device (SOT-MTJ) for realizing highly energy-efficient XNOR
operation (primary operation in BNNs). We also propose
a pulse scheme to mitigate the inherent challenge of
increased write error rate (WER) in SOT-MRAM device while
achieving energy-efficient write. We perform 1000-point
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and demonstrate a bit error
rate (BER) of 0.1–5 × 10−3 with extremely low energy
consumption of ∼4.8 fJ per XNOR operation. We also perform
system-level simulations to show robustness of our cell
by incorporating the asymmetric BERs resulting due to
thermal noise and process variations (PVs) on CIFAR-10
classification task using VGG network. Our proposed cell
holds potential for highly energy-efficient and error-tolerant
BNNs on edge devices."
44,SOT-MRAM-Based Approximate Content Addressable Memory for DNA Classification,"Abstract— In this work, we propose an approximate
content addressable memory (CAM) using a hybrid CMOS-
spin-transfer torque (STT)-spin–orbit–torque MRAM (SOT
MRAM) cell for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) classification.
Our proposed 5T-1R approximate nonvolatile CAM (ANV-
CAM) cell provides large hamming distance (HD)/mismatch
tolerance (>64 bits) for a 256-bit CAM word size while
achieving a small area overhead compared with the existing
works. We analyze the performance of our ANV-CAM cell
using a calibrated Verilog-A-based STT-SOT MRAM device
model. We perform 1000 point Monte Carlo (MC) simula-
tions including local CMOS transistor and SOT magnetic
tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) device variations at different pro-
cess corners to assess the HD tolerance of our proposed
cell. Our proposed CAM cell design is area-efficient and
enables faster, energy-efficient approximate search opera-
tion with a search delay of ∼0.6 ns and a search energy/bit
of ∼4 fJ."
44,"VPU-CIM: A 130nm, 33.98 TOPS/W RRAM based Compute-In-Memory Vector Co-Processor","Abstract—Deep Learning inference on edge devices requires
reduced memory load/store latency and low bit-precision com-
putations. To address these challenges, we present VPU-CIM:
a novel RRAM-based Compute-In-Memory (CIM) variable bit-
precision vector co-processor. We introduce vector extensions to
the RISC-V ISA and implement it as an in-memory compute unit
with a unique data mapping strategy. The design is implemented
using open-source Skywater 130nm PDK, with area estimates
provided for TSMC 28nm and ASAP 7nm PDKs. Our design
achieves an energy efficiency of 33.98 TOPS/W for a 4,4 (I, W)
precision configuration. The results demonstrate the potential of
RRAM-based vector computations in memory."
44,Experimental Investigation of EM Side Channel and FI Attacks on Commercial FRAM Chips,"Abstract 
In this study, we experimentally investigate side channel 
attack (SCA) and fault injection (FI) vulnerabilities of 
commercial FRAM chips using differential electromagnetic 
analysis (DEMA). Through experimental monitoring and 
analysis of EM emanations, we demonstrate the possibility of 
decoding memory operations. Further, we experimentally 
demonstrate a case study of information extraction and data 
corruption via an EM Fault Injection attack."
44,CMOS-RRAM based In-Memory Hamming Distance Calculation Technique,"ABSTRACT
We designed a CMOS-RRAM based in-memory
Hamming Distance (HD) calculation technique pro-
viding additional degree of mismatch as compared to
Content Addressable Memories (CAMs). One 2T2R
(2-Transistor, 2-RRAM) cell is considered to store a
single encoded bit of ternary information, while both the
RRAM cells are programmed to complementary resis-
tance states. The net current flowing through the 2T2R
unit cell results in the HD. Moreover, the HD for various
possible combinations of 16-bit input and stored data
was shown through array level circuit simulations with
integrated Transimpedence Amplifiers (TIAs) to convert
row-wise accumulated current into output voltage. The
2T2R-based technique exhibits minimum 3× area and
≥3.6× power saving as compared to existing CMOS-
NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) counterparts."

44,Spike frequency adaptation: bridging neural models and neuromorphic applications,"abstractions of real biological neurons. An essential feature of a
neuron missing in LIF is spike frequency adaptation.
Adaptive LIF models encompass all beneﬁts of a LIF model and
use a dynamic threshold that changes based on the neuron’s
recent activity. This mechanism can lead to more sophisticated
information processing, as the neuron’s sensitivity to input can be
modulated by its recent ﬁring history. With a more complex
adaptation mechanism, the model attains higher efﬁciency with
less iteration16,19,33. ALIF can replicate the phenomenon of SFA,
where neurons become less responsive to repeated input spikes
over time. This feature allows SNNs to capture more nuanced
response patterns and better represent certain types of neural
processing, increasing the computational efﬁciency as proven in
the paper16,19,33. ALIF models can be easily combined with
synaptic plasticity rules to study learning and memory processes
in SNN. The adaptive behavior of these models allows for a more
realistic exploration of synaptic strength changes and their impact
on network function. ALIF models can also be implemented on
neuromorphic hardware platforms, taking advantage of their
more biologically plausible nature.
Leaky integrate and ﬁre model. As already mentioned, LIF
models are popularly used to mimic the spiking behavior of a
neuron. The evolution of membrane potential, u(t) in an LIF
model can be written as12,34
τ du
dt ¼ RIðtÞ  ½uðtÞ  vrest
ð1Þ
where τ is the “leaky"" time constant of the membrane, R is the
membrane resistance, I(t) is the injected current, and vrest is the
resting potential of the cell. In discrete time for spiking input
Eq. (1) may be written as
uðtÞ ¼ vrest þ RIðtÞ þ ðut1  ðvrest þ RIðtÞÞÞe
dt
τ
ð2Þ
In SNN applications, R is assumed to be unity and
IðtÞ ¼ ∑
i wixiðtÞ ¼ ∑
i wiδiðtÞ
ð3Þ
where wi is the synaptic weight between target neuron and ith
pre-synaptic neuron and xi(δi) corresponding spiking input to the
ith pre-synaptic neuron. When membrane potential, u(t) at
t = t(f) crosses a predeﬁned ﬁxed threshold, v0
th, a spike is gen-
erated i.e.
t ¼ tðf Þ () uðt ¼ tðf ÞÞ ¼ v0
th
ð4Þ
Adaptive LIF. In adaptive LIF, a time-dependent function θ(t) is
added to the ﬁxed threshold, v0
th after every spike causing an
adaptation of the threshold. The threshold potential, vth(t), gra-
dually returns to its steady state value depending on threshold
adaptation time constant τθ. The expression for adaptive
threshold is thus given as12
vthðtÞ ¼ v0

f θðt  tðf ÞÞ ¼ v0

where the function θ(t) is
θðtÞ ¼ θ0exp½t=τθ
ð6Þ
when membrane potential, u(t) reaches a threshold, it is reset
to vrest
uðtÞ ≥vthðtÞ ) vðtÞ ¼ vrest
ð7Þ
Double EXponential Adaptive Threshold (DEXAT). A Double
EXponential Adaptive Threshold (DEXAT) neuron model has
been proposed by Shaban et al.19. The authors demonstrated that
the proposed DEXAT model provides higher accuracy, faster
convergence, and ﬂexible long short-term memory (working
memory in neuroscience terms) compared to existing counter
parts in the literature.
The membrane potential dynamics are described through
Eq. (1). The threshold adaptation rule is given by the following set
of equations:
vthjðtÞ ¼ bj0 þ β1bj1ðtÞ þ β2bj2ðtÞ
ð8Þ
bj1ðt þ δtÞ ¼ ρj1bj1ðtÞ þ ð1  ρj1ÞzjðtÞδðtÞ
ð9Þ
bj2ðt þ δtÞ ¼ ρj2bj2ðtÞ þ ð1  ρj2ÞzjðtÞδðtÞ
ð10Þ
where ρj1 ¼ exp½δt
τb1  and ρj2 ¼ exp½δt
τb2  control the evolution of
adaptive threshold with time, where τb1 and τb2 are threshold
adaptation time constants and β1 and β2 are two scaling factors
(β1, β2 > 0). For each spike zj(t), threshold potential vthjðtÞ
increases by β1
τb1 þ β2
τb2.
Multi-time scale adaptive threshold. In this model, the behavior
of the membrane potential is governed by Eq. (1) as well. The
threshold potential is also increased from its present value
whenever a spike is generated. The threshold gradually decays to
the resting potential, vrest depending on the decay time constants.
The rule for threshold update35 is given below:
vthðtÞ ¼ ∑
i Hðt  tiÞ þ vrest
ð11Þ
where ti is the ith spike time. The form of H(t) is described as
HðtÞ ¼ ∑
L
j¼1 αjexp½t
τj

ð12Þ
where L is the number of threshold time constants, τj is jth time
constant (j = 1, 2, …, L) and αj is the weight of the jth time
constant.

Spike response model. The spike response model (SRM) is a
generalization of the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre model12. In contrast
to the LIF model, SRM includes refractoriness behavior in the
model equation itself. While the membrane potential of an
integrate-and-ﬁre model is described using coupled differential
equations, SRM is formulated using ﬁlters.
The membrane potential, u(t), in the presence of an external
current, I(t), is given below as mentioned in refs. 12,36

A spike occurs when the membrane potential, u(t), reaches the
threshold vth(t). The membrane potential after a spike is described
by a function η(t). The function, η(t) models the refractory
behavior after a spike. The set F is a collection of all spike times
before t and is deﬁned as
F ¼ ftðf Þ; 1 ≤f ≤n : uðtðf ÞÞ ¼ vthðtðf ÞÞg
ð17Þ
The threshold for a spike generation in SRM is not ﬁxed and is
time-dependent, denoted by vth(t). A spike is generated when the
membrane potential, u(t) crosses the dynamic threshold vth(t). The
expression of spike time t(f) is given as

Here, v0

after each output spike for t(f) < t.
In SRM, when the input is a spike train, the equation for
membrane potential u(t) is modiﬁed as:

where wj is the weight of the synapse connected to the target post-
synaptic neuron through jth pre-synaptic neuron. Fj is the set of
all spike times of jth pre-synaptic neuron. The spike time of gth
spike from jth pre-synaptic neuron is denoted by tðgÞ
j . The
function ε(t) denotes spike response function.
Generalized LIF (GLIF). Researchers of the Allen Institute for
Brain Science proposed ﬁve Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire
(GLIF) models by updating the baseline LIF model37. Three
primary factors that have been considered while updating the
baseline LIF model are: (i) membrane and threshold potential
reset rule after a spike, (ii) slow affecting current from Na+ and
K+ channels which have been activated during a spiking phe-
nomenon, (iii) changes in threshold potential caused by sub-
threshold potential and spikes38. Five GLIF models are found in
the literature, namely GLIF-I to GLIF-V. The details of the ﬁve
GLIF models are as follows:
GLIF-I. Basic LIF model as described in the section ”Leaky
integrate and ﬁre model ”.
GLIF-II. GLIF-II incorporates biologically reset rule on top of the
GLIF-I. The equation for spike-induced threshold is
dθs
dt ¼ bsθs
ð21Þ
When membrane potential u(t) ≥vth + θs, it resets to
uðtþÞ ¼ vrest þ f vðuðtÞ  vrestÞ  δu
θsðtþÞ ¼ θsðtÞ þ δθs
ð22Þ
where fv is the multiplicative coefﬁcient and a threshold com-
ponent δθs has been added after every spike to θs(t).
GLIF-III. Slow ﬂuctuating currents for the activated Na+ and K+
ion channels for a spike have been included in GLIF-III. These
current components are modeled below as described in refs. 37,39:
dIjðtÞ
dt
¼ kjIjðtÞ; j ¼ 1; 2; ¼ ; N
ð23Þ
Like GLIF II, if u(t) ≥vth, the membrane potential u(t) is reset to
vr and current components Ij(t) are updated as
IjðtþÞ ¼ RjIjðtÞ þ Aj
ð24Þ
where kj, Rj, and Aj are post-spike current time constant, a
multiplicative constant (typically Rj = 1) and after-spike current
amplitude, respectively.
GLIF-IV. It combines both GLIF-II and GLIF-III models. It has
both biologically deﬁned reset, after spike current components
and a spike induced threshold potential37,39.
GLIF-V. Along with after-spike currents Ij(t)−s, and spike-
induced threshold component θs(t), a sub-threshold potential-
induced threshold variable θu(t) is deﬁned in GLIF-V. The model
has four state parameters viz. u(t), Ij(t), θs(t) and θv(t) 37,39. When
u(t) ≥θv + θs, a spike is generated and state variables are updated
following the reset rule described below:
IjðtþÞ ¼ RjIjðtÞ þ Aj
uðtþÞ ¼ vrest þ f vðuðtÞ  vrestÞ  δu
θsðtþÞ ¼ θsðtÞ þ δθs
θuðtþÞ ¼ θuðtÞ

where a and bu are adaptation index of sub-threshold potential
dependent threshold component and sub-threshold potential-
induced threshold time constant.

In particular, we present the vulnerabilities of NOR Flash and
Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) chips to VFI attack.
We experimentally inject voltage glitches with ∼12% variation in
power supply compared to the data-sheet speciﬁcations. As a case
study, we implement two NNs: i) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
and ii) AlexNet (CNN) trained on Fashion MNIST (FMNIST)
and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. We observe failure of read
operations in NVM chips due to VFI. The occurrences of soft
errors lead to signiﬁcant corruption (∼91% for FMNIST and

Experimental results show that the inference accuracy of NNs

the practical application of extracted information from the 92%

focus quantization-based optimizations for such methods. In this
work, we present a fully binarized distance computing (BinDC)
framework to perform distance computations for few-shot learn-
ing using only accumulation and logic operations (XOR/XNOR).
The proposed method leads to marginal loss in accuracy of ≈2%

mark – C) dataset. Using CPU-based computations on an embedded
platform for benchmarking, significant savings in memory (≈8×),

44,A Survey of Graph and Attention Based Hyperspectral Image Classification Methods for Remote Sensing Data,"ABSTRACT
The use of Deep Learning techniques for classification in Hyper-
spectral Imaging (HSI) is rapidly growing and achieving improved
performances. Due to the nature of the data captured by sensors
that produce HSI images, a common issue is the dimensionality
of the bands that may or may not contribute to the label class dis-
tinction. Due to the widespread nature of class labels, Principal
Component Analysis is a common method used for reducing the
dimensionality. However,there may exist methods that incorporate
all bands of the Hyperspectral image with the help of the Attention
mechanism. Furthermore, to yield better spectral spatial feature
extraction, recent methods have also explored the usage of Graph
Convolution Networks and their unique ability to use node features
in prediction, which is akin to the pixel spectral makeup. In this
survey we present a comprehensive summary of Graph based and
Attention based methods to perform Hyperspectral Image Classifi-
cation for remote sensing and aerial HSI images. We also summarize
relevant datasets on which these techniques have been evaluated
and benchmark the processing techniques."
44,Impact of High-K Deposition Process on the Noise Immunity of FeFETs and their Applicability Towards In-Memory-Computing,"Abstract—This article reports the impact of the high-k material
deposition process on the low-frequency noise and reliability of
hafnium oxide-based (HfO2) ferroelectric field-effect transistors
(FeFET). A significant influence of the deposition method on the
defect densities and, subsequently, on the low-frequency noise
of FeFETs was observed. Furthermore, a correlation with the
reliability behavior was found, and improved pathways were
identified. Finally, the impact of the FeFET’s reliability on in-
memory-computing (IMC) applications was simulated."
44,NVSystolic: Heterogeneous Simulation Framework for Emerging Memories with Systolic Array,"Abstract—In recent years, hardware accelerators have shown
signiﬁcant advantages in the ﬁeld of deep neural networks. The
architecture used in such systems has high memory utilization.
To make the most of memory technology in conjunction with
compute fabric, careful study of memory optimisation is thus
necessary. NVSystolic, a heterogeneous simulation framework
based on reconﬁgurable memory subsystems with a systolic array
serving as the computing unit, is presented in this study. In
particular, Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) can be modelled by the
framework for the systolic array-based accelerator."
44,Oxide-based Memory Devices as Artificial Dendrites for Neuromorphic Hardware,"Abstract— In this paper, we propose the emulation of artifi-
cial dendrite-like behavior by utilizing Oxide-based Resistive
Memory (OxRAM) devices for brain-inspired neuromorphic
computing hardware. Through our experiments, we demon-
strate non-linear integration and excitatory/ inhibitory char-
acteristics of the proposed dendrite behavior. To demonstrate
the temporal filtering behavior i.e low pass filtering phe-
nomenon observed in biological counterpart, we characterized
our proposed electronic dendrite from 19.23 Hz to 2.38 kHz
frequency range. The proposed artificial dendrite exhibits
the linearly decreasing trend of output current gain versus
frequency. Electrical characterizations of the proposed OxRAM
based dendrite over multiple cycles ensures reliable operation.
Moreover, we compared the proposed work with other artificial
dendrite emulations in literature. Our proposed electronic
dendrite can save >5× die-area and achieves ∼2.5× higher
integration to filtering current ratio (ILRS/IHRS) as compared
to CMOS/NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) counterparts.

44,Open-RIMC: Open-Source RRAM-based IMC Co-Processor with Reconfigurable Logic Mapping,"Abstract— In this study we present Open-RIMC, an open-
source RRAM-based IMC (In-memory computing) co-processor
that enables energy-efficient mapping of MAC (multiply and
accumulate) operations while providing reconfigurable logic-
mapping. The proposed RRAM-IMC IP is implemented us-
ing the open-source Skywater-130 nm PDK and a fully
open-source EDA tool-chain. Our IMC block acts as a co-
processor to the RISC-V based Caravel co-processor. We
demonstrate BNN (Binary Neural Network) as a potential
application along with analysis on impact of variability on
inference performance of the IMC-macro. We further analyze
trade-offs due to logic-mapping. The design is open-sourced
and available online at https://gitlab.com/NVM_IITD_
Research/RRAM_IMC_IITD. The proposed design can be
used for realizing efficient edge AI (artificial intelligence)
quantized neural networks (QNN).

Objectives In recent years, theranostic applications have emerged as promising tools in the fight against lung and breast cancers. This review 
aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the proof-of-concept theranostic applications of two cutting-edge nanomaterials: gold nanoparticles 
(AuNPs) and graphene.
Key findings Nanotechnology plays a revolutionary role in cancer theranostics. AuNPs’ properties include high surface plasmon resonances, ad-
vantageous surface-to-volume ratio, remarkable photothermal conversion rates, and distinctive optical characteristics. Whereas graphene boasts 
high surface areas, optical transparency, and remarkable versatility in surface functionalization. While AuNPs have long been recognized for their 
theranostic potential, this review spotlights the burgeoning role of graphene as a compelling choice for advancing theranostic applications in on-
cology with several exemplary studies. In fact, most recent advancements have witnessed the integration of AuNP-graphene nanocomposites 
in theranostic approaches targeting lung and breast cancers. Yet, there are still many intricate challenges that researchers face in harnessing the 
full potential of these nanomaterials in theranostics, from synthesis to clinical translation.
Summary This review provides valuable insights into both established and emerging nanomaterials. AuNPs show significant potential for diverse 
cancer theranostic applications, and graphene is rapidly evolving as a next-generation theranostic platform. The hybrid AuNP-graphene nanocomposite 
stands out as a promising candidate in the evolving landscape of cancer therapy, offering exciting prospects for future research and development.

45,Graphene/TiO<inf>2</inf> Nanocomposite based Electrochemical Biosensor Enhanced by Support Vector Machine Classification Model to Detect Different DENV Serotype IgG,"Abstract— Sequential infections by different DENV 
serotypes could lead to life-threatening complications. Thus, 
it is crucial to detect serotype specific DENV infection at 
early onset which current rapid test kits are not able to do 
so. This work presents a nano-enabled electrochemical 
biosensor for detection of serotype specific DENV infection. 
The proposed biosensor incorporated Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) as post processing tool for enhanced biosensor 
performance. The key element of the biosensor is the use of 
consensus DENV envelope protein domain-III (cEDIII) 
peptide probe that has relatively high specific affinity 
towards different DENV antibodies (IgG) serotypes. Screen-
printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified with 
graphene/titanium dioxide (G/TiO2) nanocomposite for 
improved electron charge transfer. The immunosensor 
exhibited high sensitivity towards two different DENV IgG 
serotype, namely DENV1 IgG and DENV2 IgG with limit of 
detection (LOD) of 14.05 ng/mL and 10.56 ng/mL 
respectively. The linear working range for DENV1 IgG and 
DENV2 IgG were 562.5-9000 ng/mL and 3"

45,Development of 4D Printed PLA Actuators with an Induced Internal Strain Upon Printing,"Abstract—The field of four-dimensional (4D) printing is 
still in its prime and lacking in tools to help designers and 
researchers in creating applicable structures that are 4D 
printed. In order for these tools to be available for researchers, 
testing and simulation work must be done on 4D printing and 
the shape memory effect of printed materials. In this work, 
testing of 4D printed actuators that have an induced strain 
upon printing is performed. The strain is induced in the 
printing process of fused deposition modelling. The induced 
strain allows a shape change upon stimulation of the materials 
after printing, removing the need for a programming step at 
which force, and stimulation are needed to program the 
temporary shape of the print. Two actuators and an open-sided 
box reservoir for drug delivery applications are proposed. 
Printing and shape change of polylactic acid are achieved and 
measured for the degree of bending of the actuators. The 
designs are printed at speed values of 10 mm/s and 60 mm/s for 
the passive and active layers, respectively. The printed samples 
are heated, and their bending angles are measured for 
replication by simulation. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the 
actuators is carried out to replicate the induced strain by using 
the thermal expansion of materials. The settings of the FEA are 
used to create a more complex structure and simulate its shape 
change. Deformation is achieved with values of 7.81 mm, 6.06 
mm, and 4.84 mm in the z-axis direction for Design 1, Design 2, 
and the reservoir, respectively."

45,Electrochemical DNA Sensor Based On Graphene/Zirconia ,"ABSTRACT 
In this study, a specific impedimetric DNA sensor based on 
graphene/zirconia nanocomposite has been developed to serve as 
a simple and rapid method for epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations testing, necessary to guide the treatment 
regime of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. The 
graphene/zirconia nanocomposite was synthesized via a green 
method without the use of harsh chemicals. The as-synthesized 
nanocomposite 
was 
characterized 
with 
scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to evaluate its morphology, 
crystallinity 
and 
composition. 
The 
nanocomposite 
was 
functionalized with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide 
ester (PSE) and dropped casted on screen printed electrode (SPCE) 
to provide amide bonding with single-stranded probe-DNA that is 
complementary 
to 
exon-19 
wild-type 
DNA 
sequence. 
Electrochemical responses of each assembly step of the sensing 
platform were characterized by electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Deposition of 
PSE-functionalized graphene/zirconia and immobilization of 
single-stranded DNA on the electrode were reflected by the 
increment of electron transfer resistance (Rct) in EIS analysis as 
well as the reduction of peak current (ip) in CV analysis.  The 
modified electrodes were hybridized with different target DNAs 
and the difference in electrochemical impedance before and after 
hybridization (normalized value) was adopted as the measurement 
for label-free DNA hybridization detection. The developed 
genosensor demonstrated strong distinction between the Rct for 
exon-19 wild-type DNA to exon-19 mutated DNA, leading to 
promising quantitation of DNA mutations. The biosensor also 
exhibited high specificity to exon-19 sequence with clear 
discrimination against non-complementary target. The developed 
biosensor is disposable and requires no labelling of probe or target, 
making it beneficial in terms of simplicity and efficiency.

45,Recent developments in ceramic microthrusters and the potential applications with green propellants: a review,"Abstract
Conventional chemical propellants such as hydrazine and ammonium perchlorate have been used within the realm of con-
temporary space propulsion devices and are well established owing to their rich heritage. However, their limitations such as 
toxicity, difficulty in operational handling and environmental impacts have raised concerns. In view of these limitations, the 
significance of green propellants such as hydroxylammonium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide ­(H2O2) and ammonium dinitramide 
has become more pronounced. In this paper, recent developments in ceramic microthrusters and the associated ceramic 
microfabrication techniques are reviewed. The characteristics of green propellants are examined, followed by the evaluation 
of previous attempts to incorporate green propellants into ceramic microthrusters. This has further unveiled the possibilities 
of green and clean space missions in the future."

was successfully produced without attachment of any undesirable
functional groups and ZrO2 nanoparticles of approximately
10.4 nm were homogeneously distributed on the graphene sheet.
The electrochemical performance of the graphene/ZrO2/SPCE
was assessed with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both tests suggested improved
electron transfer kinetic of graphene/ZrO2/SPCE as compared
with bare SPCE. Effect of ZrO2 precursor loading was investi-
gated, in which nanocomposites containing different ratios of
graphene and ZrO2 precursors were prepared. CV and EIS
results indicated that ratio 1:8 (graphene: ZrO2 precursor) was
the optimum composition, exhibiting the highest current response
and lowest charge transfer resistance. The potential application of

It is said that civilization began and prospered when humans could control water; and that same civilization declined and 
vanished when that control is lost.  Dams and other river low barriers were built to harness and control water in the early days 
of civilisation in order to secure the beneits for human basic needs and comfort.  Centuries later, more dams were built to cater 
for increasing population, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. But it is really in the past two centuries that many large-sized 
dams have been built to satisfy a wider range of development demands – hydropower, treated water supply, irrigation, lood 
control and environmental needs.
Towards the second half of the last century, society came to realise that dams can cause signiicant negative social and 
environmental impacts that could outweigh the original economic beneits. Opponents of dams protest vehemently world-wide 
against the development of more dams whilst proponents are convinced that they are a necessary feature to support growth and 
prosperity.  It is these contradicting beliefs in mind that the public must be engaged to facilitate a better understanding of the 
views of both the proponents and the opponents of dam development before deciding on a long-term strategy. In the meantime, 
more effort may have to be made for water and energy conservation strategies and to realize the potential applications of low 
impact and non-structural solutions that complement existing dams and defer new dam development to as far into the future 
as possible.
This paper aims to provoke a critical debate amongst engineers and the public to look at the longer term future of dams in water 
resources development that could possibly reduce the fundamental demand for services that dam provides.  In other words, to 
try and answer the question “Why should a country rich in water, as Malaysia is, need to construct dams and even plan for 
more?”

45,"Journal – The Institution of Engineers, Malaysia (Vol. 75, No. 1, June 2014)11Bifurcation Behaviour of the Buck Converter","ABSTRACT
The bifurcation and chaos phenomena appeared in power system have become a focus subject at present. It 
has become apparent about a decade ago that power converters exhibit various types of non-linear behaviour 
which includes all kinds of bifurcations and chaos. Even basic DC/DC converters  exhibit  bifurcation and  chaos 
phenomena  as well as  parallel-connected DC/DC converters and PFC system. The main source of such non-linearity 
is the switching mechanism of the converters. Non-linear components of the converter circuit and control scheme 
such as the use of naturally-sampled, constant-frequency PWM further contribute to the non-linear behaviour of 
converters such as a DC-to-DC buck converter. Thus, all feedback controlled power converters exhibit certain 
non-linear phenomena over a specific breadth of parameter values. Despite being commonly encountered by power 
electronics engineers, these non-linear phenomena are by and large not thoroughly understood by engineers. This 
paper examines the bifurcation behaviour of the buck converter in an ideal case when the input voltage is varied. 
The computer simulation scheme, PSPICE is employed to model the behaviour of the ideal buck converter. For 
certain values of the input voltage, Vin instability occurs. The analysis and conclusion presented in this paper will 
provide an overview of the bifurcation behaviour of the DC-to-DC buck converter, aspiring to draw attention of the 
power electronics and the circuits and systems communities to a field that is not often researched and examined."
46,Looking at Outﬁt to Parse Clothing,"Abstract
This paper extends fully-convolutional neural networks
(FCN) for the clothing parsing problem. Clothing parsing
requires higher-level knowledge on clothing semantics and
contextual cues to disambiguate ﬁne-grained categories.
We extend FCN architecture with a side-branch network
which we refer outﬁt encoder to predict a consistent set of
clothing labels to encourage combinatorial preference, and
with conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) to explicitly consider
coherent label assignment to the given image. The empiri-
cal results using Fashionista and CFPD datasets show that
our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in cloth-
ing parsing, without additional supervision during training.
We also study the qualitative inﬂuence of annotation on the
current clothing parsing benchmarks, with our Web-based
tool for multi-scale pixel-wise annotation and manual re-
ﬁnement effort to the Fashionista dataset. Finally, we show
that the image representation of the outﬁt encoder is useful
for dress-up image retrieval application."
46,Hybrid LED traffic light detection using high-speed camera,"Abstract— Automatic trafﬁc light detection (TLD) plays an
important role for driver-assistance system and autonomous
vehicles. State-of-the-art TLD systems showed remarkable
results by exploring visual information from static frames.
However, trafﬁc lights from different countries, regions, and
manufactures are always visually distinct. The existing large
intra-class variance makes the pre-trained detectors perform
good on one dataset but fail on the others with different
origins. One the other hand, LED trafﬁc lights are widely used
because of better energy efﬁciency. Based on the observation
LED trafﬁc light ﬂashes in proportion to the input AC power
frequency, we propose a hybrid TLD approach which combines
the temporally frequency analysis and visual information using
high-speed camera. Exploiting temporal information is shown
to be very effective in the experiments. It is considered to be
more robust than visual information-only methods.

46,Multimed Tools Appl (2016) 75:1813–1841,"Abstract Photo collage, which constructs a compact and visually appealing representation
from a collection of input images, can offer a most convenient and impressive user experi-
ence. Most previous approaches to collage construction have utilized saliency detection and
visibility optimization. However, such methods are computationally expensive and not fea-
sible for real-time applications such as online image retrieval or interactive photo browsing.
Moreover, the effectiveness of automatic saliency detection may be questionable. Even if the
main regions of interest are retained accurately, some visually not salient but semantically
important items such as logos, captions, and copyright information located at the margins
and corners may be missed. In our alternative approach, we address the issue of content-
preserved collage, which avoids content-harmful processes such as cropping or changes to
aspect ratio and orientation. Based on a full balanced binary layout tree, our algorithm can
pack all the input images tightly onto the collage canvas while keeping their visual infor-
mation unchanged. The proposed algorithm is fast, requiring less than 0.5 ms to generate a
100-image collage. We also present several extensions and applications oriented to a variety
of usage contexts and device platforms."
46,MangaWall: Generating manga pages for real-time applications,"ABSTRACT
Recent advances in non-photorealistic rendering provide the
best convenience for automatic image to manga conversion.
However, we are facing a dilemma that the ﬁne-grained
manga conversion algorithms always involve computation in-
tensive processes (e.g. image over-segmentation, brute-force
feature matching, and energy optimization), which make it
inapplicable to real-time applications.
On the other hand,
commercial manga Apps available for smart phones usually
rely on simple edge detection and halftoning or hatching.
Although the processing can be ﬁnished in several seconds,
the conversion quality is not satisfactory yet. In this paper,
we propose MangaWall to automatically convert and orga-
nize photos into manga pages.
Our goal is to establish a
lightweight manga rendition framework as well as generate
high-quality images.
To achieve this, the manga structure
is enhanced by ﬂow-based DoG operation and image vec-
torization. A multi-layer tone mapping and contrast-aware
halftoning method is then proposed to render the manga-like
screentone patterns. Besides, for multi-image input, a full
binary tree-based layout representation is employed to efﬁ-
ciently organize manga images onto the same page canvas.
Our MangaWall can be applied to real-time applications. It
takes less than 0.7 second to convert a 1024 × 768 image into
manga on Laptop PC."
46,Int J Multimed Info Retr (2014) 3:1–14,"Abstract
There have been recent studies on partial near-
duplicate videos, which involve segments of videos that
are near duplicates of each other. State-of-the-art search-
ing schemes usually segment the input video into clips and
implement clip-level near-duplicate retrieval. However, the
segmentation results are always poorly aligned, which lead
to a difﬁcult “unbalance” problem. In this paper, we intro-
duce a self-similarity-based feature representation called the
Self-Similarity Belt (SSBelt), which derives from the Self-
Similarity Matrix (SSM). In addition, a distinctive pattern in
SSBelt called the Interest Corner is detected and described
by a bag-of-words representation. The visual words are then
combined into visual shingles and indexed by an inverted ﬁle
index for fast retrieval. Another important task is to accu-
rately align the unbalanced clips, for which we propose the
Intensity Mark (IMark) and design a coarse-to-ﬁne near-
duplicate video localization scheme. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of our approach for both web-based
near-duplicate video and unbalanced video datasets. The
near-duplicate alignment capacity of IMark is also shown
to be effective."

to efficiently generate layout to compactly arrange many 
photos onto a single canvas. For the first problem, we pro-
pose a novel image annotation scheme by employing both of 
the image visual features and Metadata. Motivated by the 
observation that SNS (Social Networking Service) images, 
especially those come from the user’s acquaintances always 
contain rich information, we apply these images as our 
training set and explore their social attributes. In our defini-
tion, social attributes contain a set of intrinsic labels such as 
Who, When, Where, and What. To effectively arrange the 
photos on a single canvas, we proposed a binary tree based 
representation and fast algorithm for layout generation. 
Experiments show the examples of Friend Wall. The effec-

ing a lower reconstruction error and obtaining
a sparse representation at the region level.
Furthermore,
a

rithm to embed this constraint into the index
system, which economizes both the computa-
tion time and storage spaces. Finally, experi-
ments on five image databases for partial-
duplicate image retrieval show the efficiency
and effectiveness of our approach.
Generating VSRRs
In this work, we detect VSRRs as the retrieval
unit for partial-duplicate image retrieval. We
define a VSRR as an image region that has
rich visual content and visual saliency. The
VSRR generation procedure includes four
steps: perceptive unit construction, saliency
map generation, original VSRR generation,

46,A Rotation I nvariant Descriptor for Robust  Video Copy ,"Abstract. A large amount of videos on the Internet are generated from authorized 
sources by various kinds of transformations. Many works are proposed for robust 
description of video, which lead to satisfying matching qualities on Content Based 
Copy Detection (CBCD) issue. However, the trade-off of efficiency and effective-
ness is still a problem among the state-of-the-art CBCD approaches. In this paper, 
we propose a novel frame-level descriptor for video. Firstly, each selected frame is 
partitioned into certain rings. Then the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and 
the Relative Mean Intensity (RMI) are calculated as the original features. We finally 
fuse these two features by summing HOGs with RMIs as the corresponding weights. 
The proposed descriptor is succinct in concept, compact in structure, robust for rota-
tion like transformations and fast to compute. Experiments on the CIVR’07 Copy 
Detection Corpus and the Video Transformation Corpus show improved perfor-
mances both on matching quality and executive time compared to the pervious ap-
proaches."
46,Social Attribute Annotation for Personal Photo Collection,"Abstract—Social attributes for photos, which simply refer to a 
set of labels {Who, When, Where, What}, are intrinsic attributes 
of an image. For instance, given a scenery photo without 
human bodies or faces, we cannot say the photo has no relation 
with social individuals. In fact, it could have been taken when 
we went travelling with other friends. To effectively annotate 
social attributes, we obtain training images from friends’ SNS 
albums. Moreover, to cope with limited training data and 
organize photos in a feature-effective way, we introduce a 
batch-based framework, which pre-clusters photos by events. 
After graph learning based annotation, a post processing step 
is proposed to refine the annotation result. Experimental 
results show the effectiveness of the proposed batch-based 
social attribute annotation framework."
46,Appearance-based Friend  Recommendation for Soci al Network Service  ,"Abstract Recently, with the rapid development of Internet technology, Social Network Service (SNS) has blossomed into a 
worldwide popularity. In this paper, we present a novel application for friend recommendation on SNS websites. Unlike the 
questionnaire based friend recommendation scheme used nowadays (e.g. online dating sites, online matchmaking sites), we 
focus on the fact that most of the online users may be interested with the strangers whose appearances are somehow attractive 
according to their own preferences. Therefore, we present a friend recommendation system based on the appearances on photos, 
which aims to “make friend by the first sight”. The system is built upon 5000 portraits photos as source dataset with another 50 
photos as training set. Once the user provides rating to several photos in the training set, we first build his/her appearance pref-
erence model based on face detection and multi-features co-operation. Then, the images in the source are ranked according to 
different features respectively. Finally, the results of multi-features are fused via the method of Borda count. The system is a 
useful complement to the conventional psychological tests based friend recommendation scheme. It is easy to play with and of 
a lot of fun."
46,Matching Content-based Saliency Regions for partial-duplicate image retrieval,"ABSTRACT
In traditional partial-duplicate image retrieval, images
are commonly represented using the Bag-of-Visual-Words
(BOV) model built from image local features, such as SIFT.
Actually, there is only a small similar portion between partial-
duplicate images so that such representation on the whole im-
age is not adequate for the partial-duplicate image retrieval
task. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to retrieval
partial-duplicate images with Contented-based Saliency Re-
gion (CSR). CSRs are such sub-regions with abundant visual
content and high visual attention in the image. The content of
CSR is represented with the BOV model while saliency analy-
sis is employed to ensure the high visual attention of CSR.
Each CSR is regarded as an independent unit to be retrieved
in the dataset. To effectively retrieve the CSRs, we design a
relative saliency ordering constraint, which captures a weak
saliency relative layout among interest points in the CSR.
Comparison experiments with four state-of-the-art methods
on the standard partial-duplicate image dataset clearly verify
the effectiveness of our scheme. Further, our approach can
provide a more diverse retrieval result, which facilitates the
interaction of portable-device users."

cally analyze home videos and provide users satisfactory experi-
ences. In this paper, we present a novel user experience for home 
video called Memory Matrix, which could facilitate users to re-
experience the joy of their memories, travelling along not only the 
time axis but also the space axis. In other words, the video clips 
(sub-shots) are organized both by taken times and taken locations, 
which further allows the user to browse home videos taken at 
similar locations. Moreover, given a specific query in Memory 
Matrix (row, column), it can also provide the user optional sum-
maries along the time axis or space axis. The summarization 
scheme in this paper is based on a top-down interest score genera-
tion algorithm which automatically propagates the pre-labeled 
video level interest scores to sub-shot level interest scores. Firstly, 
the user is asked to provide interest scores to all the video se-
quences in the home video collection. Then, the video sequences 
are decomposed into sub-shots which are represented by key-
frames. Consequently, we employ multi-scale spatial saliency 
analysis to remove the foregrounds and model the background 
scenes based on histogram of visual words. Finally, the interest 
scores are propagated from video level to sub-shot level by using 
gradient descent algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the 
effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our framework.

46,Vicept: link visual features to concepts for large-scale image understanding,"ABSTRACT 
On noticing the paradox of visual polysemia and concept poly-
morphism, this paper proposes a new perspective called “Vicept” 
to associate elementary visual features and cognitive concepts. 
Firstly, a carefully prepared large image dataset and associate 
concepts are established. Secondly, we extract local interest 
points as the elementary visual features, cluster them into visual 
words, and use Fuzzy Concept Membership Updating (FCMU) to 
build the link between codebook and concept membership distri-
butions. This bottommost feature is called “Vicept word”. Then, 
the global level Vicept features are established to correlate con-
cepts with (partial) images. Finally, we validate our Vicept ap-
proach and show its effectiveness in concept detection task. Our 
approach is independent of case-specific training data and thus 
can be extended to web-scale scenarios.

46,Adding Affine Invariant Geometric Constraint for Partial-Duplicate Image Retrieval,"Abstract—The spring up of large numbers of partial-duplicate 
images on the internet brings a new challenge to the image 
retrieval systems. Rather than taking the image as a whole, 
researchers bundle the local visual words by MSER detector 
into groups and add simple relative ordering geometric con-
straint to the bundles. Experiments show that bundled features 
become much more discriminative than single feature. Howev-
er, the weak geometric constraint is only applicable when there 
is no significant rotation between duplicate images and it 
couldn’t handle the circumstances of image flip or large rota-
tion transformation. In this paper, we improve the bundled 
features with an affine invariant geometric constraint. It em-
ploys area ratio invariance property of affine transformation 
to build the affine invariant matrix for bundled visual words. 
Such affine invariant geometric constraint can cope well with 
flip, rotation or other transformations. Experimental results on 
the internet partial-duplicate image database verify the promo-
tion it brings to the original bundled features approach. Since 
currently there is no available public corpus for partial-
duplicate image retrieval, we also publish our dataset for fu-
ture studies."
46,Bridging the gap between objective score and subjective preference in video quality assessment,"ABSTRACT 
 
Nowadays, the issue of objective video quality assessment 
has been extensively studied. However, the human visual 
system (HVS) is the ultimate receiver for videos thus 
leading to a gap between objective scores calculated by 
computers and subjective preferences given by observers. In 
this paper, we focus on bridging this gap by introducing a 
psychological criterion called contrast effect. That is, 
because of the impression about the quality of previous 
frame still remaining in observers’ minds, they tend to 
underestimate or overestimate the quality of the current one. 
Noticing this fact, we propose a video quality assessment 
system with an additional revision module to bridge the gap 
mentioned above. Firstly, the video is described by several 
representative clips with large entropy values. Then, we 
present Quality Words (including luminance, contrast, 
structure and spatio-temporal texture) to evaluate the quality 
of distorted video. To characterize the spatio-temporal 
texture, a new descriptor called Rotation Sensitive 3D 
Texture Pattern (RS-3D) is proposed. Finally, we revise the 
result in the revision module motivated by contrast effect. 
Experiments on VQEG Phase I FR-TV test dataset [1] 
verify the effectiveness of our method."
46,Fast copy detection based on Slice Entropy Scattergraph,"ABSTRACT 
 
With the exponential growth of digital video resources, huge 
amount of videos are uploaded onto the Internet. Therefore, 
the Content Based Copy Detection (CBCD) issue becomes a 
hot research topic and has been extensively studied recently. 
However, most of the approaches lack the power to 
efficiently handle large data corpus while maintaining a 
good detection quality. In this paper, we propose a fast 
CBCD approach based on the Slice Entropy Scattergraph 
(SES). SES employs video spatio-temporal slices which can 
greatly decrease the storage and computational complexity. 
It is based on entropy and its deviation so as to preserve as 
much as the video information. Besides, SES takes 
advantage of a scattergraph which is succinct and efficient 
to plot the distribution of video content. To effectively 
describe SES, we introduce three descriptors: Projection 
Histograms, Shape Contexts and Polynomial Coefficients. 
The experiments on CIVR’07 Copy Detection Corpus and 
Video Transformation Corpus show the performance 
improvement of our approach both on efficiency and 
effectiveness."
46,Friend recommendation according to appearances on photos,"ABSTRACT 
Unlike the questionnaire based friend recommendation scheme 
used in Social Network Service (SNS) websites nowadays (e.g. 
online dating sites, online matchmaking sites), we focus on the 
fact that most of the online users may be interested in the strang-
ers whose appearances are somehow attractive according to their 
own preferences. In this paper, we present a friend recommenda-
tion system based on the appearances on photos. The system is 
built upon 5000 portraits photos as source dataset with another 50 
photos as training set. Once the user provides rating to several 
photos in the training set, we first build his/her appearance prefer-
ence model based on face detection and multi-features coopera-
tion. Then, the images in the source are ranked according to dif-
ferent features respectively. Finally, the results of multi-features 
are fused via the method of Borda count. The system is a useful 
complement to the conventional psychological tests based friend 
recommendation scheme. It is easy to play with and of a lot of fun.

46,Near-duplicate video matching with transformation recognition,"ABSTRACT 
Nowadays, the issue of near-duplicate video matching has been 
extensively studied. However, transformation, which is one of the 
major causes of near-duplicates, has been little discussed. In this 
paper, we focus on the fact that a certain kind of feature may per-
form excellently to deal with one type of transformation while not 
be that good on another. We present a self-similarity matrix based 
near-duplicate video matching scheme with an additional trans-
formation recognition module. By detecting the type of transfor-
mations, the near-duplicates can be treated with the ‘best’ feature 
which is decided experimentally. Thus, we obtain an enhanced 
matching result by employing the selected feature. Our work in-
cludes seven features and ten transformations respectively, and 
experimental results show the effectiveness of transformation 
recognition and the promotion it brings to boost the near-duplicate 
matching scheme.

47,"Seismic and radon signatures: A multiparametric approach to monitor surface dynamics of a hazardous 2021 rock–ice avalanche, Chamoli Himalaya","Abstract
The observation of precursory signals of the 2021 Chamoli rock–ice avalanche pro-
vides an opportunity to investigate the multidisciplinary analysis approach of rock
failure. On 7 February 2021, a huge rock–ice mass detached from the Raunthi peak
at Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, India. The tragic catastrophe resulted in more than
200 deaths and significant economic losses. Here, we analyse radon concentration
and seismic signals to characterise the potential precursory anomalies prior to the
detachment. Continuous peaks of radon anomalies were observed from the after-
noon of 5 to 7 February and decreased suddenly after the event, while a cumulative
number of seismic tremors and amplitude variations are more intensified 2.30 h
before the main event, indicating a static to dynamic phase change within the weak
zone. This study not only characterises abnormal signals but also models the rock fail-
ure mechanisms. The analysis unveils three time-dependent nucleation phases, physi-
cal mechanisms of signal generation and a complete scenario of physical factors that
affected the degree of criticality of slope failure. The results of this study suggest
gradual progression of rock cracks/joints, subsequent material creep and slip
advancement acceleration preceded the final failure. Furthermore, the study high-
lights the importance of an early warning system to mitigate the impact of events like
the 2021 Chamoli rock–ice avalanche.

47,Supply Chain Dynamics With Sensor Integration for Consumer Electronics in Retail and E-Commerce,"Abstract— In this innovative study, a cutting-edge dual-channel 
closed-loop supply chain model with sensor data integration for 
third-party recycling has been effectively developed. Our 
innovative study provides unmatched insights into the world of 
consumer electronics by examining the effects of fund 
management regulations and retail e-commerce participation on 
three different choice scenarios. The compelling results show that 
retail e-commerce, the revolutionary force in the retail industry, 
has a tangible impact on the pricing and profits of traditional 
brick-and-mortar stores. In response to this trend, the wholesale 
pricing strategies of consumer electronics manufacturers have 
been adapted to maximize profitability within the retail e-
commerce landscape. Fascinatingly, the impact of retail e-
commerce involvement remains impervious to the recycling 
decisions and optimal profits of third-party recyclers. In consumer 
electronics, fund-handling policies are crucial in boosting the 
number of product recoveries and driving up prices for businesses 
in the forward supply chain. Although manufacturers' market 
share is affected by retail e-commerce, overall product demand is 
unaffected. On the other hand, putting fund-handling policies into 
place indicates a decline in overall market demand. This 
innovative study uses sensor integration to unlock the complex 
dynamics of the interesting field of digital supply chain

47,ARNN: Attentive Recurrent Neural Network for Multi-channel EEG Signals to Identify Epileptic Seizures,"Abstract
We proposed an Attentive Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN), which recurrently applies attention layers along a sequence and
has linear complexity with respect to the sequence length. The proposed model operates on multi-channel EEG signals rather
than single channel signals and leverages parallel computation. In this architecture, the attention layer is a computational unit
that efficiently applies self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to compute a recurrent function over a wide number of state
vectors and input signals. Our architecture is inspired in part by the attention layer and long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
and it uses long-short style gates, but it scales this typical cell up by several orders to parallelize for multi-channel EEG signals. It
inherits the advantages of attention layers and LSTM gate while avoiding their respective drawbacks. We have evaluated the model’s
effectiveness through extensive experiments with heterogeneous datasets, including the CHB-MIT and UPenn and Mayo’s Clinic
datasets. The empirical findings suggest that the ARNN model outperforms baseline methods such as LSTM, Vision Transformer
(ViT), Compact Convolution Transformer (CCT), and R-Transformer (RT), showcasing superior performance and faster processing
capabilities across a EEG datasets. The code has been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Salim-Lysiun/ARNN."

In order to achieve customer fulfillment, modifications must be made to the ongoing care and 
assistance processes in order to improve the quality of customer-centric facilities. Because 
repetitive attempts typically abdicate numerous attributes, regular variants tend to muddy 
quality analysis. However, traditional statistical analysis methods interpret normal variations 
but require a time-subordinate variety of senses, resulting in an extra delay in direction. 
Statistical quality control, or SQC, is a mindset, a technique, and a collection of rational tactics 
for advancing framework, process, and outcome improvement in a variety of industries, such 
as horticulture, manufacturing, and healthcare. The objective of this study is to recognize the 
areas of the most striking terminations and give ideas to improvement to decrease the quantity

supply chains. Factors such as diversification, adoption of technology, and climate-resilient agricultural practices emerge to 
fortify the robustness of supply chains. These events look set to become more common, and survey results point emphatically 
in the direction of diversifying sources and markets. Case studies offer a model for successful strategies against an uncertain 
future. Recognized as a resilience enabler, technology is challenged by limited access and concerns about data security and 
interoperability. Precision farming and geographic information system mapping are among the climate-resilient practices that 
help stabilize crop production. Financial limitations, which disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises, 
prevent the implementation of resilience measures. Differences in regulatory standards across the regions create bottlenecks, 
and all policies have to be standardized while still being locally sensitive. The research argues for strategic interventions, 
such as financial support mechanisms and skills development programs to remove obstacles limiting resilience. These results 
have far-reaching potential to inform policymakers, industry participants, and researchers about how to build an integrated 
regulatory environment for innovation in technology.

47,One-dimensional regional shear velocity structure from joint inversion of fundamental mode group velocity dispersion measurements of Love and Rayleigh waves: application to the Uttarakhand Himalaya,"Abstract
Between 2017 and 2019, the CSIR-NGRI, Hyderabad, Telangana, established a broad-band seismic-network with fifty-five 
3-component broadband seismometers in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. Out of 55 three component broadband 
seismic (BBS) networks, we chose 17 for the present study. Using digital waveform data from twenty-one (21) regional Indian 
earthquakes of Mw 5.0–6.2 that were recorded in the 17 broadband seismometer, we compute fundamental mode group-
velocity dispersion (FMGVD) characteristics of surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves) and the average one-dimensional 
regional shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure of the Uttarakhand Himalayan region. First, we compute FMGVD curves for 
Love waves (6–73 s) and Rayleigh waves (at 6.55–73 s) period, and then, we finally invert these dispersion curves to compute 
the final average one-dimensional regional crustal & sub-crustal shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure below the Uttarakhand 
Himalaya. Our best model in Uttarakhand Himalayan region, India, reveals the 8-layered crust with a mid-crustal low veloc-

We image the high-resolution velocity structures of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the western part of the Himalayan-

of the crust varies between ˜40-65 km from south beneath the sub-Himalaya to north beneath the Higher Himalaya. The thickest
crust imaged as thick as ˜85 km, located ˜100 km from ITSZ towards north beneath the southwest Tibet. Our results also report
signiﬁcantly variable geometry of the Moho boundary along the tectonic trend of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen, which may
indicate that the Indian plate subducted/underthrusted beneath the Eurasian plate in a piecewise manner as a consequence of
diﬀerential convergence rates, counter clockwise rotation of the Indian plate and episodic collision processes. We also image the
geometry of the subducting/underthrusting Indian plate beneath the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen. We present the geodynamic
model of the two subducted slabs, where the Indian plate subducts/underthrusts towards north and the Tibetan slab subducted
southwards beneath the Tibetan plateau. We infer that the Indian plate is torn into pieces diﬀering in its northern limits and

47,Automated detection of Hypertensive Retinopathy using few-shot learning,"abstract features. The
VGG model offers configurations like VGG16 (with 16 weight lay-
ers) and VGG19 (with 19 weight layers), which have become widely
adopted. He et al. [58] proposed ResNet, a deep residual learning-
based CNN architecture. The model’s key feature is the use of residual
connections or skip connections, which allow the network to efficiently
train very deep structures. These skip connections enable the flow of
information from earlier layers directly to deeper layers, addressing
the issue of vanishing gradients and simplifying network optimiza-
tion. Its variants are ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152, where
50, 101, and 152 represent the number of layers in the architecture,
respectively. DenseNet is a kind of CNN architecture that makes use
of dense connections between layers by connecting all layers directly
with one another using dense blocks [59]. The architectures typically
consist of several densely connected blocks, each with multiple layers.
Feature maps from previous layers are concatenated within each block,
resulting in a compact and efficient representation of the features.
The DenseNet model offers variations such as DenseNet-121, DenseNet-
169, and DenseNet-201, with different depths and complexities. The
Inception-v3 is the successor of Inception-v1 architecture. The most
innovative aspects of the Inception-v3 model are its efficient use of
computational resources and its capacity to capture multiscale fea-
tures. This is accomplished by employing inception modules, which
are responsible for extracting features at various levels of abstraction.
Inception modules are parallel convolutional layers with various filter
sizes, enabling the model to simultaneously capture local and global
features. It consists of six convolution layers followed by one pooling
layer in each inception layer [56]. Xception is a deep CNN architecture
with Depthwise Separable Convolutions [57]. The model is inspired
by the Inception architecture, but it incorporates depthwise separable
convolutions, a revolutionary approach to convolutional layers. First,
depthwise convolutions are used, which execute independent convo-
lutions on each input channel. The preceding stage’s output is then

combined across different channels using pointwise convolutions. The
separation of spatial and channel convolutions enables the Xception
model to significantly decrease computing complexity while keeping
a comparable level of accuracy.
The performance results indicate that the proposed method sig-
nificantly outperformed the other ten state-of-the-art pretrained CNN
models. The comparative results demonstrate that the DenseNet-169
model outperformed the other state-of-the-art CNN models.
Table 9 presents a comparative analysis between the proposed
method and several shallow state-of-the-art CNN models: AlexNet [60],
VGG-11, VGG-16 [55], and ResNet-9 [58]. These CNN models were
trained from scratch. We selected these specific models for comparison
due to limited dataset availability and to mitigate overfitting issues.
AlexNet’s architecture includes multiple convolutional layers with rec-
tified linear unit (ReLU) activations, allowing for nonlinearity and
improved feature representation. Following these convolutional layers
are max-pooling layers, which minimize spatial dimensions and im-
prove translation invariance. AlexNet also used techniques like dropout
regularization and data augmentation to avoid overfitting and increase
generalization.
The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperformed all other state-of-the-art CNN models with
an average accuracy of 0.9844, even when these models were trained
from scratch. Among all state-of-the-art CNN models, the VGG-11
model outperformed the other CNN models with an average accuracy
of 0.9134. Table 9 shows CNN models with deeper architectures, such
as VGG-16 and ResNet-9, exhibit comparatively lower performance
compared to CNN models with shallower architectures.
Table 10 presents a comparative analysis between the proposed
method and the current state-of-the-art method. The results clearly
indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed existing
HR detection methods. To ensure a fair evaluation, we rigorously
implemented the existing methods and evaluated them on our datasets,
employing identical training, testing, and validation splits as well as
the same implementation settings as the proposed method. Among all
other existing state-of-the-art HR detection methods, Mobile-Net based
architecture proposed in [35] performs well even on our datasets.
Table 11 presents a comparative analysis of the results achieved
by the proposed method and other existing methods in the literature,
on the STARE dataset. Triwijoyo et al. [28] evaluated their method
on the STARE dataset and achieved an accuracy of 0.8093. Similarly,
Wiharto et al. [33] also evaluated their method on the STARE dataset
and achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 0.8400 and 0.8800, re-
spectively. Whereas, the achieved performance by the proposed method
in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and precision of
0.9764, 0.9657, 0.9657, 0.9564, and 0.9477, respectively. It shows that
the proposed method outperforms these existing HR methods on the
STARE dataset.
Table 12 presents the comparative analysis of the proposed method
with other existing methods in the literature. This can be considered as
indirect comparison with the proposed method when it comes to com-
paring it to those with a limited number of images, different datasets
for evaluation, and limited DL-based studies for HR. Abbas et al. [12]
and Qureshi et al. [61] trained their models for four segmented HR
biomarkers which include exudates, microaneurysms, haemorrhages,
and blood vessels based features. It is important to note that they
utilized their own local dataset, which includes the segmentation of all
four HR biomarkers. Therefore, implementing their method directly for
detecting and analyzing all four HR biomarkers becomes challenging
without access to their specific dataset, which contains the segmented
data for these HR biomarkers. The proposed method achieved an aver-
age accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and precision of 0.9844,
0.9844, 0.9844, 0.9844, and 0.9848, respectively.

Between 2017 and 2019, the CSIR-NGRI, Hyderabad, Telangana, established a broad-band seismic-network with
fifty-five 3-component bb seismometers in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. Out of 55 three component
broadband seismic (BBS) networks, we chose 17 for the present study. Using digital waveform data from twenty-
one (21) regional Indian earthquakes of Mw 5.0-6.2 that were recorded in the 17 broadband seismometer, we
compute fundamental mode group-velocity dispersion (FMGVD) characteristics of surface waves (love and
Rayleigh waves) and the average one-dimensional regional shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure of the Uttarakhand
Himalayan region. First, we compute FMGVD curves for Love waves (6-73sec) and Rayleigh waves (at 6.55-73
sec) period and then, we finally invert these dispersion curves to compute the final average one dimensional
regional crustal & sub-crustal shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure below the Uttarakhand Himalaya. Our best model
in Uttarakhand Himalayan region, India, reveals the 8-layered crust with a mid-crustal low velocity layer (MC-LVL)

47,A Novel Channel Minimization Technique for Diagnosis of Preterm Labor using Uterine Magnetomyography,"Abstract—The aim of this paper is to reduce the number of
channels for Uterine Magnetomyography recording in order to
facilitate its use in home uterine activity monitoring. We propose
a technique of channel minimization using mutual information

(CR). The result is a reduced channel set of 3 out of a large
array of 148 with an improved classification accuracy of 6"
47,Deep Optimized Electrodes and Frequency Bands in the Phase Space for Identification of Seizures,"Abstract—The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been exten-
sively used to record brain signals for the analysis of neurological
diseases over several decades. Epilepsy is the one of the most
common neurological disorder in the world. It is associated
with seizures, which are a clinical manifestation of abnormal,
excessive excitation and synchronisation of a population of
cortical neurons, resulting in abrupt changes in consciousness,
movement, behaviour, and feelings. Our goal in this letter is to
propose a computationally efficient EEG based system that can
detect seizures with improved detection performance. To deeply
optimize the electrodes and frequency bands, we proposed a
fast computational algorithm by finding the critical electrodes
and optimal sub-bands of EEG signals. We used wavelet packet
decomposition (WPD) to find optimal sub-bands and maximum
relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method for electrodes
selection. It is found that the portrait of the features in the phase
space depicted promising discriminating ability to detect seizure
efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperformed the state-of-art methods and provided 100% and
94.79% of detection accuracy on UBonn and CHB-MIT datasets,
respectively, at a significantly reduced computational cost."

We explore the hypothesis that b-value act as stress meter which varies inversely with diﬀerential stress and decreases until
it reached the depth of brittle-ductile transition. Correlation of seismogenic asperity and brittle-ductile contact (BDC) with
b-value is of special interest. Lowest b- and Dc-values coincides with transition depth and interpreted as seismogenic asperities.
Moderate ruptures (ML[?]5.0) nucleate in vicinity of transition zone where stress concentration is highest. We illustrate behavior
of mid-crustal detachment and dependence of topographic elevation above Mid-Crustal Ramp (MCR). The depth 10-15 km is
marked as MCR which coincides with ﬂuids, seismogenic asperity and shows seismic clustering. The composite trend in abrupt
escalation of b-value is observed at depth [?]12 km and [?]7 km for Garhwal and Kumaun region respectively. These depth
ranges is demarcated as BDC which coincides with proposed MCR and exhibiting as an alarming asperity zone (12-15 km) for
future great earthquake in Garhwal-Himalaya.

In this paper we provide a review of Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) for both printed and handwritten domains. 
We describe the past work in a manner that clearly highlights the common and distinguishing aspects.  The review reveals the 
advances in the techniques used for detection and recognition of MEs for online and offline modalities. Systems have evolved from 
use of domain specific crafted modules to architectures learned in a completely data driven manner. Learning tasks and datasets

48,Distributed Variational Bayes-Based In-Network Security for the Internet of Things,"Abstract—The past few years have witnessed the compelling
applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in our daily life. The
explosive growth of the number of IoT devices also presents
a great challenge in network security, especially the DDoS
attack. Current DDoS defense mechanisms adopted out-of-band
architecture, which is accomplished by a process that receives
monitoring data from routers and switches, then analyzes that
ﬂow data to detect attacks. However, facing IoT devices grow-
ing rapidly, this out-of-band architecture confronted with limited
processing capacity, bandwidth resources, and service assurance
problems. Recently, with the development of the program-
ming switch, it opens up new possibilities for in-network DDoS
detection, where the detection algorithms could be directly imple-
mented inside the routers and switches. Beneﬁt from switch
processing performance, the in-network mechanism could achieve
high scalability and line speed performance. Therefore, in this
article, we design a machine learning-based in-network DDoS
detection framework. We implement the lightweight variational
Bayes algorithm in each switch to detect the anomaly trafﬁc.
Besides, considering the shortage of training data in each switch,
a centralized platform is introduced to synchronize parame-
ters among distributed switches to realize collaborative learning.
Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed
algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes."
48,Robust Social Event Detection via Deep Clustering,"Abstract—Social networks are quickly becoming the primary
medium for discussing what is happening around real-world
events. However, it is still a challenge to detect events on
social media due to its real-time nature, scale and amount of
unstructured data generated. In this paper, we present a novel
real-time system for detecting surrounding real-world events.
Our proposed framework consists of four main components,
including text ﬁltering, text representation, deep clustering, and
event merging. After ﬁltering non-event messages, we use entities
and words to represent messages. Based on text representation,
we propose a novel density clustering algorithm for online event
detection. The resulted sub-events are further merged based
on time information and keyword similarity. Experiments on
standard and real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness
of our proposed method."
48,IPFC: An Attentive Face Completion Network with Identity Preserving,"Abstract—Face completion 
is 
a challenging task since the 
facial textures and structures are hard to be captured and 
generated. Meanwhile, the blank area is usually completed 
by 
an 
average 
face, 
which 
may 
blur 
the 
individual 
information during the face completion processing. To solve 
these problems, 
we propose 
an Identity-Preserving Face 
Completion Network (IPFC). Firstly, we design an attentive 
generative 
module 
for 
achieving 
the 
pixel-level 
spatial 
relations and use the relations to capture the details of the 
face 
images. 
Then, 
we 
employ 
two 
discriminators 
to 
distinguish 
face 
authenticity 
and 
individual 
differences. 
During the optimization stage, we develop three schemes to 
minimize 
the 
generation 
error: 
(1) 
Full image 
and 
eye 
reconstruction losses are used to provide global and partial 
supervision, respectively. 
(2) The face authenticity loss 
is 
utilized 
as 
a basic restriction 
to keep the generated data 
distribution. (3) The individual discriminate loss is designed 
to capture the identity distribution from the training data 
without any other extra data. We apply our method on 
a 
popular benchmark CelebA-HQ, and 
it achieves state-of- 
the-art performances in four metrics."
48,untitled,"Abstract—Social network information is a measure of the
number of infections. Understanding the effect of social network
information on disease spread can help improve epidemic fore-
casting and uncover preventive measures. Many driving factors
for the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases remain
unclear. Some experts believe that redundant information on
social media may increase people’s panic to evade the restrictions
or refuse to report their symptoms, which increases the actual
infection rate. We analyze the engagement in the COVID-19
topics on the Internet and ﬁnd that the infection rate is not
only related to the total amount of information. In our research,
information entropy is introduced into the quantiﬁcation of the
impact of social network information. We ﬁnd that the amount
of information with different distributions has different effects
on disease transmission. Furthermore, we build a new dynamic
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model with infor-
mation entropy to simulate the epidemic situation in China.
Simulation results show that our modiﬁed model is effective in
predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.

48,Mobility-Aware Pre-caching Based on Unsupervised Deep Generative Model for Small Cell Networks,"Abstract—Due to the short coverage of small-cell base stations
(SBS), mobile device is more likely to move away from its
covered area, and thus has to continually switch between SBSs
and reestablish the connections with the remote servers. Aiming
for improving the delivery efﬁciency of ever-growing mobile
data trafﬁc, we conceive proactive caching over dense small-cell
network (DSCN). Without any prior knowledge, it is challenging
to ﬁgure out users movements and determine content placement
in SBSs. Motivated by the recent advances in deep learning,
we ﬁrst propose a model-free mobility prediction approach
based on the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) in this
paper. Our approach is able to infer the latent information
about users habits, which are considered to be closely related
to their movements, from historical trajectory. By testing on
real-world GPS trajectories, our approach achieves a prediction
accuracy of about 80%. Then based on the movement prediction,
we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the local
cache utility for DSCN. The experimental results show that
our mobility-aware pre-caching strategy can support a seamless
mobility handover with a lower delay and a higher data rate.

48,Optimal Network Defense Resource Allocation  ,"Abstract—Advanced persistent threats (APT) has brought a 
huge threat to the cyber network. In order to protect the network 
from APT attacks or reduce the loss caused by APT attacks, the 
reasonable allocation of defense resources can greatly improve the 
security of the network system. We consider two kinds of defense 
resources: 1) preventive resources able to defend nodes against 
internal infection or the external attack, such as these computing 
power resources that are spent on APT attack detection; 2) 
recovery resources able to recover the node after it has infected, 
such as these human resources that are spent on recovery 
operations when a host is infected. We study the following problem: 
give a fixed total security budget, find the optimal protected 
resources allocation scheme for network under APT to reach the 
security state at maximal rate. Different from the previous 
relevant work, we take the influence of external attack into 
consideration. We show that the optimal resource allocation 
problem for the network under APT can be solved in polynomial 
time using geometric programming. Finally, we validate the 
allocation scheme of preventive and recovery resource that we 
proposed greatly improves the security of the network system 
under APT."
48,Semantic Social Event Evolution Discovering,"Abstract—People tend to express their opinions and emotions
on social platforms, such as Weibo and Twitter. Although recent
researches can discover topics and detect events from social
messages, people pay more attention to the evolution analysis
of events. However, existing methods only utilize the statistical
characteristics of the text instead of semantic information. In this
paper, we construct a 6-tuple to represent events to analyze the
correlation between events from multiple perspectives. In order to
mine the evolutionary relationship between events, we develop the
method for measuring event similarity by concerning entities and
texts. In terms of textual similarity measuring, we do a domain-
adaptive incremental training task on the pre-trained NLP model
to gain word embeddings for semantic information. Experiments
on real social datasets show that our technique precedes the
baseline technique.

48,Relevance-Aware Anomalous Users Detection in Social Network via Graph Neural Network,"Abstract—Anomalous users detection in social network is
an imperative task for security problems. Motivated by the
great power of Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), many current
researches adopt GNN-based detectors to reveal the anomalous
users. However, the increasing scale of social activities, explosive
growth of users and manifold technical disguise render the
user detection a difﬁcult task. In this paper, we propose an
innovate Relevance-aware Anomalous Users Detection model
(RAU-GNN) to obtain a ﬁne-grained detection result. RAU-
GNN
ﬁrst extracts multiple relations of all types of users in
social network, including both benign and anomalous users, and
accordingly constructs the multiple user relation graph. Secondly,
we employ relevance-aware GNN framework to learn the hidden
features of users, and discriminate the anomalous users after
discriminating. Concretely, by integrating Graph Convolution
Network(GCN) and Graph Attention Network(GAT), we design a
GCN-based relation fusion layer to aggregate initial information
from different relations, and a GAT-based embedding layer to
obtain the high-level embeddings. Lastly, we feed the learned
representations to the following GNN layer in order to consolidate
the node embedding by aggregating the ﬁnal users’ embeddings.
We conduct extensive experiment on real-world datasets. The
experimental results show that our approach can achieve high
accuracy for anomalous users detection."
48,TGAE: Temporal Graph Autoencoder for Travel Forecasting,"Abstract—With the development of intelligent transportation
systems, timely and accurate travel forecasting task has witnessed
growing interest. Unlike most previous research that only con-
siders the demand prediction in origin regions, this task aims to
predict the origin-destination demand between all-region pairs.
Its main challenges come from effectively capturing the direction,
weight, and temporal information of links in dynamic trafﬁc
networks. To confront these challenges, we treat the dynamic
trafﬁc networks as multiple weighted directed network snapshots
and propose a graph-based deep learning framework, Tempo-
ral Graph Autoencoder (TGAE). Speciﬁcally, TGAE encodes
the fundamentally asymmetric nature of a directed graph via
directed neighborhood aggregation and learns a pair of vector
representations for each node. Meanwhile, we
use the graph
attention mechanism to capture the weight information of links.
Next, TGAE preserves the temporal dependencies by indepen-
dently reconstructing the existence and weight of links over
two consecutive time steps. Furthermore, we employ the Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to capture the evolution
patterns of trafﬁc networks and predict both the direction and
weight of links based on the historical data. Experimental results
demonstrate that TGAE outperforms several baseline methods on
the travel forecasting task, which can help trafﬁc management,
resource preallocation, and services optimization."
49,A computational study on phase velocity mediated droplet splitting and its mechanism at T-junction microchannel,"Abstract
In this study, 2D numerical simulations were conducted to reveal the breakup and non-breakup mechanism of a droplet 
in a horizontal microfluidic T-junction using oil–water volume fraction contours, pressure profile, velocity profile, and 
vorticity profile. The numerical simulation is validated with experimental results taken from the literature. Two types of 
droplet breakup regimes, namely tunnel breakup and obstructed breakup along with a non-breakup regime with the alternate 
movement of droplets, were found. The tunnel breakup is mainly due to the formation of vortex flow in front of the droplets, 
whereas the breakup at obstruction is induced by the formation of high upstream pressure in the main channel. Interestingly, 
a pressure swing phenomenon is identified, which drives the droplets in the horizontal microfluidic T-junction’s alternating 
arms. Depending on the phase velocities, numerous mixed phenomena were also observed when the droplets flow through 
the horizontal T-junction microchannel. A flow pattern map is presented to guide the on-demand requirement of the flow 
behavior based on two dimensionless numbers, namely capillary number and mixture Reynolds number. It is found that the 
drift flux model provides a better prediction of pressure drop than the homogeneous model."

poly(diallyldi-

proposed for highly sensitive carbon monoxide (CO) detec-

tionalized with PDDA, and the functionalizationis investigated
by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The
MWCNT-PDDA composite is used as a sensing material with
deposited interdigitated electrodes (IDE) of silver (Ag) on
glass substrates. The resistance of the sensors changes due
to charge transfer from CO to the positively charged qua-
ternary ammonium group present on PDDA. The developed
sensors are able to detect very low concentrations of CO gas
ranging from 1 to 20 ppm with high sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) of 127 ppb. The interference of other gases
and volatile organic compounds is investigated, and the results are presented. The inﬂuence of humidity and temperature
on the sensors is also explored. The stability and repeatability of the sensors are examined, and the sensors are almost
stable for 2 months with excellent reproducibility.The sensors also follow the Langmuir adsorption/desorptionmodel. The
sensors have shown excellent potential for rapid CO gas sensing, and it can be used in wearable electronics applications."

HPLC analysis showed the diatom could degrade phenol in
the concentration range of 50–250 mg/l in Fog’s media.
The highest speciﬁc growth and degradation rate were
achieved at 100 mg/l phenol. It could also mineralize

model best represents the growth behavior of the diatom in
nutrient media as well as reﬁnery wastewater. Biokinetic
parameters suggest that the diatom possesses higher max-
imum speciﬁc growth rate (lmax = 0.4 day-1), better tol-
erance to toxicity (KI = 90.24 mg/l) and high phenol
afﬁnity (Ks = 20.99 mg/l) in reﬁnery wastewater as com-
pared to Fog’s media conﬁrming practical applicability of

highest degradation rate at this concentration. Infrared

its potential use as feedstock of clean ecofriendly energy

Water lubrication technique is one of the most efficient ways to transport viscous oil through pipelines. Flow of two

transform larger two-phase flow structures into the 
smaller ones by incorporating simple tuning of 
microchannel geometry. The two-phase flow is 
modelled employing the in-built phase-field model 
which is commercially available with COMSOL 
Multiphysics software. With the help of a series of 
numerical simulations, we show that larger plug flow 
can be transformed into smaller droplets by 
introducing an orifice at the T-junction of the 
microfluidic channel. The size of the droplets can be 
tuned by varying the diameter of the orifice. In 
addition, the frequency of droplets can also be varied 
by changing the diameter and position of the orifice 
along the length of the microfluidic channel. The 
results shown in this study can be helpful in the

tion due to their potential to revolutionize healthcare monitoring. Among the various components
involved in these biosensors, the electrode material plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate and
reliable detection. In this regard, polymer electrodes, such as Poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):

50,Electrochemical Investigation of PEDOT:PSS/Graphene Aging in Artificial Sweat,"Abstract: Herein, we investigate the potential application of a composite consisting of PEDOT:PSS/
Graphene, deposited via spray coating on a flexible substrate, as an autonomous conducting
film for applications in wearable biosensor devices. The stability of PEDOT:PSS/Graphene is
assessed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
linear polarization (LP) during exposure to an artificial sweat electrolyte, while scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the morphological changes in the layer following
these. The results indicate that the layers exhibit predominant capacitive behavior in the potential
range of −0.3 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, with a cut-off frequency of approximately 1 kHz and retain 90%
capacity after 500 cycles. Aging under exposure to air for 6 months leads only to a minor increase
in impedance, demonstrating potential for storage under non-demanding conditions. However,
prolonged exposure (>48 h) to the artificial sweat causes significant degradation, resulting in an
impedance increase of over 1 order of magnitude. The observed degradation raises important
considerations for the long-term viability of these layers in wearable biosensor applications,
prompting the need for additional protective measures during prolonged use. These findings
contribute to ongoing efforts to enhance the stability and reliability of conducting materials for
biosensors in health care and biotechnology applications."
50,Electrochemical Properties of PEDOT:PSS/Graphene Conductive Layers in Artificial Sweat,"Abstract: Electrodes based on PEDOT:PSS are gaining increasing importance as conductive elec-
trodes and functional layers in various sensors and biosensors due to their easy processing and
biocompatibility. This study investigates PEDOT:PSS/graphene layers deposited via spray coating
on flexible PET substrates. The layers are characterized in terms of their morphology, roughness (via
AFM and SEM), and electrochemical properties in artificial sweat using electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The layers exhibit dominant capacitive behavior
at low frequencies, with cut-off frequencies determined for thicker layers at 1 kHz. The equivalent
circuit used to fit the EIS data reveals a resistance of about three orders of magnitude higher inside
the layer compared to the charge transfer resistance at the solid/liquid interface. The capacitance
values determined from the CV curves range from 54.3 to 122.0 mF m−2. After 500 CV cycles in a
potential window of 1 V (from −0.3 to 0.7 V), capacitance retention for most layers is around 94%,
with minimal surface changes being observed in the layers. The results suggest practical applications
for PEDOT:PSS/graphene layers, both for high-frequency impedance measurements related to the
functioning of individual organs and systems, such as impedance electrocardiography, impedance
plethysmography, and respiratory monitoring, and as capacitive electrodes in the low-frequency
range, realized as layered PEDOT:PSS/graphene conductive structures for biosignal recording."

of spraying and a different number of spraying cycles. The most 
favorable conditions for obtaining uniform, low resistive, and 
highly transparent film in a repeatable manner were determined. 
At a substrate temperature of 100 oC, the sheet resistance was 
56.6 Ω/sq, the surface roughness was 5.95 nm and the average 
transparency in the visible range of wavelength was 91 %. The 
coating is intended for electrodes in a sweat sensor, which will be 
interfaced with transition metal chalcogenides and MXenes in 
different sensing architectures that can be electrical, or optical. As 
such, the obtained results for the PEDOT:PSS/graphene coatings

a proposed hybrid whale optimization algorithm differen-
tial evolution (WOADE) as a maximum power point track-
ing (MPPT) for wind energy conversion systems (WECS)
employed for water pumping applications. The proposed
hybrid MPPT algorithm provides rapid and zero oscillation

51,Loss Minimization for Linear Induction Motors Based on Finite-Set Predictive Control with Lower Number of Switching Voltage Vectors,"Abstract— This paper suggests a loss minimization (LM) for 
linear induction motors (LIMs) where the optimum value of 
the primary flux linkage is derived for this goal. The derivation 
of the optimum primary flux linkage is based on the concept of 
field-oriented control. Meanwhile, the main control method is 
finite-set model predictive control (FSMPC) based on the 
primary flux linkage in the cost function. The presented 
FSMPC removes the use of a weighting factor with only one 
proportional control in the output speed control loop. In 
addition, it reduces the number of calculations where it uses 
only four voltage vectors in the prediction stage. These four 
voltage vectors consist of two active voltage vectors and two 
null voltage vectors. Parameters of a 3-kW arc machine are 
adopted to confirm the validity of the suggested control method 
and check the overall performance of the LIM drive system. 
The obtained results compare the use of four and eight voltage 
vectors. Besides, it shows the difference between the adoption 
of the optimum primary flux linkage from LM and the rated 
value as reference values."
51,Resonant DC/DC Converters: Investigating Phase-Shift Control,"Abstract: The paper presents an innovative approach to control the voltage of an LCL-T type converter
at the output side against variation at input and load ports, utilizing a ﬁxed-frequency phase-shift
control scheme. The examination of the converter is performed employing a Fourier series method
that takes into account the effect of n-harmonics. To assure high-frequency switches with a zero-
voltage switching (ZVS) technique, the lagging pf mode is utilized. PSIM simulations were used to
investigate the performance of a 300 W converter. With the minimal input voltage, all switches turn
on with ZVS for all loading conditions, whereas the ZVS strategy loses by two switches when the
voltage at the input is highest. The power loss calculations of each component are performed and
presented in a pie chart. The ﬁndings of the experiments are presented and veriﬁed with theoretical
and simulation results. It is demonstrated that for both input voltage and load ﬂuctuations, a minor
adjustment in pulse width is sufﬁcient to keep the output voltage constant."

an economical and simple control strategy with optimal PV
power extraction from the PV module. Moreover, an explicit

and simpler computational implementation compared to the
Lambert-W function based estimation. The indirect-ﬁeld oriented
control has been discussed for linear induction motor (LIM)
based drive to uphold decoupling phenomena. Later, the total
sliding mode controller (TSMC) based space vector pulse width
modulation technique (TSMC SVPWM) is proposed to provide
robustness behaviour with minimised chattering characteristics of
the total sliding mode controller (TSMC), which is employed for
speed control of LIM. Practical responses have been presented to
judge the performance of single-stage PV water pumping under

51,Dynamic stability assessment of interconnected thermal‐SsGT‐solar photovoltaic‐EV power system with ARO optimized IDN‐FOID amalgamated controller,"Abstract
To succeed over the sudden load-frequency variations in interlinked power systems, an
equilibrium must be maintained between power generations and losses. The major prob-
lem associated to manifold interlinking arenas of power systems is load frequency control.
In this paper, a multiple-arena scheme is examined which encompasses thermal and split
shaft gas turbine plants. Here, artiﬁcial rabbit optimization (ARO) is applied to pro-
cure the premium standards of the supplementary controller. The projected controller
is the amalgamation of integer order integral-derivative with ﬁlter (IDN) and fractional
order integral-derivative (FOID). So, the amalgamation is IDN-FOID. Henceforth, the
ARO augmented IDN-FOID controller is recognized. The ARO augmented IDN-FOID
supplementary controller delivers enhanced outcomes related to additional secondary con-
trollers like I, PI, and PIDN. Valuation articulates about the improved act of ARO over
added algorithms using the IDN-FOID controller related to converging nature, transient
proﬁle, and steady-state assessment. Assessment is done in the presence of non-linearities
in generation rate constraints and time delay. It is also detected that scheme potent
outcomes with the IDN-FOID controller are superior when the scheme is instructed
with solar photovoltaic, electric vehicles, solid oxide fuel cells, and ultra-capacitor. The
ARO optimized IDN-FOID controller is the anticipated arrangement for the measured
scheme.

51,Atmospheric Monitoring and Fire Prevention Electronic System for Mining Workers,"Abstract—Mining is one of the deadliest industries in the world.
In some countries, many miners face problems with health issues
and safety risks and are left to fend for themselves in the event
of injury without assistance. Coal miners are exposed to coal
dust and toxic materials such as mercury, arsenic, and lead,
which are released during the process of mining. Toxic materials
have ionizing radiation, thereby damaging the genetic material
(DNA). Finally, the workers are affected by various diseases
such as respiratory diseases, skin diseases, and genetic disorders.
Work-related deaths are commonly caused by rock falls, fires,
explosions, methane poisoning, and drilling. So this methodology
provides an effective solution for monitoring the environment,
and the main goal of this system is to relieve workers from an
unhealthy lifestyle. This system proposes a wearable ear muff
that prevents hazardous noise from coming from the process
of mining. The system is developed with a vibration sensor.
Whenever the vibration exceeds the limit, a relay alert is sent
through an ear muff with the help of audio playback. To prevent
the inhalation of toxic gases, a mask is used, which is made up
of several layers and attached to a fan that acts as a filter for
dust particles. This methodology also prevents fire accidents by
means of a smoke sensor, which gives an alert through a buzzer
when it exceeds the limit. Various parameters can be detected
by using humidity, temperature, and oxygen sensors, which will
be displayed on the LCD in order to ensure the healthy life of
workers."

for the proposed controller for the various intelligent controllers of BLDCM."
51,New Multi-Leg Converter for DC Microgrid with Two Duty Cycles,"Abstract: In recent times, important contributions and the incorporation of renewable sources,
such as photovoltaic, fuel cells, etc., are the main reasons for the popularity of DC microgrids.
Integrating renewable sources into the microgrid requires high-voltage, high-efﬁciency DC-to-DC
converters. Without modiﬁcation, traditional converters are not suitable for achieving the required
voltage in microgrid applications, due to the requirement for a large duty cycle, inductor resistance,
voltage rating of switches, reverse recovery of the diode, high current rating inductors, etc. Various
converters based on the circuitry of voltage multipliers, switched inductors/capacitors, coupled
inductors, transformers, etc., have been proposed in the literature and have their drawbacks. In
this paper, to realize signiﬁcant voltage gain with two duty cycle controls, a new multi-leg (ML)
converter is recommended as a solution for use in DC microgrids. The converter is designed by
incorporating multiple legs into the boost converter. The implications of the proposed converter
are reduced device voltage stress, small inductors and capacitors, two-duty cycle control, triple
mode operation, single-stage conversion, etc. The proposed converter’s power circuits, mode of
operation, and design equations of the converter are presented. The non-ideal model of the proposed
converter is discussed, and efﬁciency is analyzed. The effect of unequal insurance on the operation
of the converter is discussed. Comparative studies of converters are provided to draw attention to
the beneﬁts of the converter. The results of the experiments are shown to prove that the analysis
and performance of the converter are correct. The discontinuous mode of operation and unequal
inductance case of the converter are studied with the help of a simulation model."
51,Non-Isolated DC&#x2013;DC Power Converter With High Gain and Inverting Capability,"ABSTRACT As the voltage gain of converter increases with the same ratio, the current gain also increases,
this increase in current gains will affect the size of the input and the output capacitor. To reduce the ripple
in the input current with simultaneous decreasing the input current ripple, a novel current fed interleaved
high gain converter is proposed by utilizing the interleaved front-end structure and Cockcroft Walton
(CW)-Voltage Multiplier (VM). The ‘‘current fed’’ term is used because, in proposed circuitry, all the
capacitors of CW-VM are energized by a current path via inductors of the interleaved structure. The proposed
converter can be applied as an input boost up the stage for low voltage battery energy storage systems,
photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell (FC) based DC-AC applications. The anticipated topology consists of the two
low voltage rating switches. The main beneﬁts of the anticipated converter conﬁguration are the continuous
(ripple free) input current, high voltage gain, reduced switch rating, high reliability, easy control structure
and a high percentage of efﬁciency. The proposed converter’s working principle, mathematical based steady-
state analysis, and detailed component design are discussed. The parasitic of the components has been
considered in the analysis to show the deviation from the ideal cases. A detailed comparison with the other
available converters is presented. The experimental results of the 300W prototype are developed to conﬁrm
the performance and functionality of the anticipated DC-DC converter."

51,A Multilevel Inverter Topology Using Diode Half-Bridge Circuit with Reduced Power Component,"Abstract: This paper presents a new multilevel converter with a reduced number of power compo-
nents for medium voltage applications. Both symmetric and asymmetric structures of the presented
multilevel converter are proposed. The symmetric topology requires equal dc source values, whereas
the asymmetric topology uses minimum switch count. However, both structures suffer from high
blocking voltage across the switches. To reduce the blocking voltage on switches, an optimal topology
is presented and analyzed for the selection of the minimum number of switches and dc sources,
while maintaining a low blocking voltage across the switches. A comparative analysis with recently
published topologies was performed. The simulation results, as well as the comparative analysis,
validated the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed topology in terms of the reduced power
loss, lowered number of components, and cost. Furthermore, in addition to the simulation results, the
performance of the proposed topology was veriﬁed using experimental results of 9, 17, and 25 evels."
52,Attentions in Deep Framework to Enhance Images Degraded by Non-Homogeneous Haze,"Abstract—The availability of dehazing datasets has enabled 
various deep learning techniques to perform effectively on hazy 
images. Most of the developed frameworks focus on removing 
homogeneous haze. However, homogeneous-centric methods pro- 
duce sub-optimal results on non-homogeneous haze. The primary 
reason is that the architectures devised to handle homoge- 
neous haze fail to address the non-uniformity of haze in non- 
homogeneous case. The secondary reason is the unavailability 
of enough data for the non-homogeneous scenario. Although 
many works cite the lack of data as a primary concern for 
poor performance, we find that the results are sub-standard 
even if the homogeneous-centric networks are trained with 
non-homogeneous data. Hence, there is a requirement for a 
network architecture that can handle non-homogeneous haze in 
a better way. In this work, we propose to use multiple attention 
mechanisms in parallel along with pre-trained ConvNeXt blocks. 
Specifically, we use pixel, channel, and residual channel attention 
mechanisms. Pixel attention can complement channel attention in 
dealing with space-variant haze when connected in parallel. On 
the other hand, residual channel attention fetches hazy image- 
related features and caters to better information flow toward the 
output. The proposed method by concatenating the attention- 
based features yields better results than the existing approaches."
52,Low-Resolution Face Recognition Using Multi-Stream CNN in Siamese Framework,"Abstract—Face recognition systems have been signiﬁcantly
advanced in recent times by the emergence and advancement of
deep learning approaches. However, low-resolution face recog-
nition is still a challenging task, especially when the images
are snapped in an unconstrained condition. Such conditions are
common in surveillance applications, where the snapped facial
images often contain blur, non-uniform illumination, non-frontal
pose, and occlusions. Further, the resolution of the images is often
restricted due to different constraints. In this paper, we propose
a network architecture consisting of multi-stream CNN based on
the Siamese framework for low-resolution face recognition. Mul-
tiple streams of the CNN extracts complementary discriminative
information from face images suitable for recognition purpose.

52,Increasing Transferability by Imposing Linearity and Perturbation in Intermediate Layer with Diverse Input Patterns,"Abstract—Despite high prediction accuracy, deep networks are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, designed by inducing human-
indiscernible perturbations to clean images. Hence, adversarial
samples can mislead already trained deep networks. The process
of generating adversarial examples can assist us in investigating
the robustness of different models. Many developed adversarial
attacks often fail under challenging black-box settings. Hence, it
is required to improve transferability of adversarial attacks to
an unknown model. In this aspect, we propose to increase the
rate of transferability by inducing linearity in a few intermediate
layers of architecture. The proposed design does not disturb the
original architecture much. The design focuses on significance
of intermediate layers in generating feature maps suitable for a
task. By analyzing the intermediate feature maps of architecture,
a particular layer can be more perturbed to improve the trans-
ferability. The performance is further enhanced by considering
diverse input patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the
success in increasing the transferability of our proposition.

52,Generating Targeted Adversarial Attacks and Assessing their Effectiveness in Fooling Deep Neural Networks,"Abstract—Deep neural network (DNN) models have gained
popularity for most image classification problems. However,
DNNs also have numerous vulnerable areas. These vulnerabil-
ities can be exploited by an adversary to execute a successful
adversarial attack, which is an algorithm to generate perturbed
inputs that can fool a well-trained DNN. Among various existing
adversarial attacks, DeepFool, a white-box untargeted attack is
considered as one of the most reliable algorithms to compute
adversarial perturbations. However, in some scenarios such as
person recognition, adversary might want to carry out a targeted
attack such that the input gets misclassified in a specific target
class. Moreover, studies show that defense against a targeted
attack is tougher than an untargeted one. Hence, generating
a targeted adversarial example is desirable from an attacker’s
perspective. In this paper, we propose ‘Targeted DeepFool’,
which is based on computing a minimal amount of perturbation
required to reach the target hyperplane. The proposed algorithm
produces minimal amount of distortion for conventional image
datasets: MNIST and CIFAR10. Further, Targeted DeepFool
shows excellent performance in terms of adversarial success rate.

52,Automatic Image Colorization using Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Abstract—Image colorization is a technique to add color values
to the grayscale image by learning the mapping between input in-
tensity and probable chrominance values. This paper proposes an
end-to-end image colorization architecture based on an ensemble
of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). Ensemble DCNN
architecture for image colorization is our novel contribution. The
architecture takes inspiration from the encoder-decoder design.
The encoder comprises various pre-trained DCNN models, and the
decoder consists of a series of convolution and up-sampling layers.
The decoder enables the merging and propagation of multi-level
features from DCNN models. Further, we explore different fusion
strategies to combine multi-level features from DCNNs as part
of an ensemble encoder. We have experimented with DIV2k and
CIFAR10 datasets. The performance of our proposed approach
is evaluated in terms of subjective and reference-based image
quality assessment metrics, which shows that our results are pretty
competitive compared to the existing approaches."
52,Temporally Consistent Video Manipulation for Facial Expression Transfer,"Abstract—Facial expression transfer is an important problem
in the computer vision community due to its applicability in
human-computer interaction, facial animation, etc. Most of the
existing approaches mainly deal with images. However, expres-
sion transfer to videos is yet to be explored. The extension
of existing image-based approaches to videos often leads to
ﬂickering artifacts in the result. This is due to the temporal
inconsistency that may have been produced due to the indepen-
dent processing of frames. In this paper, we address this problem
by proposing a combination of loss functions in association with
a deep learning-based method. Image reconstruction loss takes
care of spatial domain consistency. The ﬂow and warp losses
address the temporal consistency. By maintaining consistency
spatially as well as temporally, our method produces visually
plausible results. The efﬁcacy of our method is further explored
in different problems like video dehazing, and video colorization."
52,Deep Networks for Image and Video Super-Resolution,"Abstract
Eﬃciency of gradient propagation in intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks is of key importance for super-
resolution task. To this end, we propose a deep architecture for single image super-resolution (SISR), which is built using
eﬃcient convolutional units we refer to as mixed-dense connection blocks (MDCB). The design of MDCB combines the
strengths of both residual and dense connection strategies, while overcoming their limitations. To enable super-resolution for
multiple factors, we propose a scale-recurrent framework which reutilizes the ﬁlters learnt for lower scale factors recursively
for higher factors. This leads to improved performance and promotes parametric eﬃciency for higher factors. We train two
versions of our network to enhance complementary image qualities using diﬀerent loss conﬁgurations. We further employ our
network for video super-resolution task, where our network learns to aggregate information from multiple frames and maintain
spatio-temporal consistency. The proposed networks lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art
techniques on image and video super-resolution benchmarks.

52,Mitigating Channel-wise Noise for Single Image Super Resolution,"ABSTRACT
In practice, images can contain different amounts of noise for different color channels, which is not acknowledged by existing
super-resolution approaches. In this paper, we propose to super-resolve noisy color images by considering the color channels jointly.
Noise statistics are blindly estimated from the input low-resolution image and are used to assign different weights to different color
channels in the data cost. Implicit low-rank structure of visual data is enforced via nuclear norm minimization in association with
adaptive weights, which is added as a regularization term to the cost. Additionally, multi-scale details of the image are added to
the model through another regularization term that involves projection onto PCA basis, which is constructed using similar patches
extracted across different scales of the input image. The results demonstrate the super-resolving capability of the approach in real
scenarios.

52,Fusion-UWnet: Multi-channel Fusion-based Deep CNN for Underwater Image Enhancement,"Abstract—Underwater image enhancement has been consid-
ered as one of the prime research areas due to its massive
signiﬁcance in underwater surveillance and the development of
underwater autonomous robotics. Deep learning methods have
been used for image processing, where heavy models like GANs
and very deep CNNs are being deployed for the task. Due to the
bulky nature of the models, they consume signiﬁcant memory
and are numerically expensive in computational tasks, making
them inefﬁcient to some degree in underwater exploration tasks.
These models are primarily trained over synthetically generated
data which makes them less correlative for real-world tasks.
This paper proposes a deep network architecture that uses a
series of convolutional blocks to fuse signiﬁcant complementary
features of two separate enhanced versions of the input image
along with the input one. Further, a combination of perceptual
and structural similarity losses is used to ﬁnd out the error. We
have also benchmarked our model on three underwater datasets,
highlighting the generalizing capabilities over a mix of real-world
and synthetic data."
52,Local Proximity for Enhanced Visibility in Haze,"Abstract—Atmospheric medium often constrains the visibility
of outdoor scenes due to scattering of light rays. This causes
attenuation in the irradiance reaching the imaging device along
with an additive component to render a hazy effect in the
image. The visibility is further reduced for poorly illumi-
nated scenes. The attenuation becomes wavelength dependent
in underwater scenario, causing undesired color cast along
with hazy effect. In order to suppress the effect of different
atmospheric/underwater conditions such as haze and to enhance
the contrast of such images, we reformulate local haziness in a
generalized manner. The parameters are estimated by harnessing
the similarity of patches within a local neighborhood. Unlike
existing methods, our approach is developed based on the
assumption that for outdoor scenes, the depth of patches changes
gradually in a local neighborhood surrounding the patch. This
change in depth can be approximated by patch similarity in that
neighborhood. As the attenuation in irradiance of an image in
presence of atmospheric medium relies on the depth of the scene,
the coefﬁcients related to the attenuation are estimated from the
weights of patch similarity. The additive haze effect is deduced
using non-local mean of the patch. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the
haze component as well as in enhancing the image under different
conditions of haze (daytime, nighttime, and underwater).

Differences with [51] , [53] : While [51] and [53] are proposed 
for a high-level computer vision task (object recognition), MDCN 
is suited for image restoration tasks and adopts the concept of 
blending a variety of dense topological connections at both macro 
and micro level. Other ncessary design changes include removal of 
the batch-normalization (BN) layers since they consume the same 
amount of GPU memory as convolutional layers, increase com- 
putational complexity, and hinder performance for image super- 
resolution. We also remove the pooling layers, since they could 
discard pixel-level information necessary for super-resolution. To 
enable higher growth rate, each MDCB contains with a 1 × 1 con- 
volution layer, which fuses the information from the large num- 
ber of features channels into a fewer feature channels and feeds 
these to the next MDCB block. Further each MDCB contains a third 
connection in the form of an additive operation between its input 
features and the output features. 
3.3. Scale-Recurrent design 
Most existing SR algorithms treat super-resolution of different 
scale factors as independent problems without considering and 
utilizing mutual relationships among different scales in SR. Exam- 
ples include EDSR [6] , which require many scale-speciﬁc networks 
that need to be trained independently to deal with various scales. 
On the other hand, architectures like VDSR [8] can handle super- 
resolution of several scales jointly in the single network. Training 
the VDSR model with multiple scales boosts the performance 
and outperforms scale-speciﬁc training, implying the redundancy 
among scale-speciﬁc models. Nonetheless, VDSR style architecture 
takes bicubic interpolated image as the input, which contains less 
information (as compared to the true LR image) leading to sub-

optimal feature extraction; and performs convolutions in HR space, 
leading to higher computation time and memory requirements. 
We propose a scale-recurrent training scheme which has the 
advantages of the approaches mentioned above, while subduing 
their limitations. Our networkâ;;s global design is a multi-scale 
pyramid which recursively uses the same convolutional ﬁlters 
across the scales, motivated from the fact that a network capable 
of super-resolving an image by a factor of 2 can be recursively used 
to super-resolve the image by a factor 2 s , s = 2 , 3 , · · · Even with the 
same training data, the recurrent exploitation of shared weights 
works in a way similar to using data multiple times to learn pa- 
rameters, which actually amounts to data augmentation regarding 
scales. We design the network to reconstruct HR images in inter- 
mediate steps by progressively performing a 2 × up-sampling of 
the input from the previous level. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst train a net- 
work to perform SR by a factor of 2 and then re-utilize the same 
weights to take the output of 2 × as input and result into a output 
at resolution 4 × . This architecture is then ﬁne-tuned to perform 
4 × SR. We experimentally found that such initialization (train- 
ing for task of 2 × SR) leads to better convergence of the net- 
works for larger scale factor. Ours is the ﬁrst approach that eﬃ- 
ciently re-utilizes the parameters across scales, which signiﬁcantly 
reduces the number of trainable parameters while yielding perfor- 
mance gains for higher scale factors. An illustration of this scheme 
is shown in Fig. 4 . 
4. Perceptual and objective quality trade-off
A recent study of various loss functions [9] has revealed that an 
algorithm can be potentially improved only in terms of its distor- 
tion (pixel-reconstruction error) or in terms of its perceptual qual- 
ity (visual sharpness), but one at the expense of the other. This 
complementary property can be observed in the performance of 
two networks: SRGAN and SRResNet, proposed in [5] , that utilize 
L2 loss and adversarial loss functions, respectively, to obtain dif- 
ferent type of super-resolution results. Interestingly, it was found 
that losses based on feature maps of a deep CNN eg. VGG-Net have 
higher correlation with both the objective quality as well as per- 
ceptual quality. 
Most of the existing methods lack the ﬂexibility of traversing 
from a better objective (MSE-based) quality to a better perceptual 
quality during test time, as the conventional loss functions do not 
support both of the quality measurements simultaneously. We pro- 
pose to use two networks to overcome this issue. Our ﬁrst network 
is trained with a weighted combination of L1 and VGG54 (on fea- 
ture outputs of conv5-4 layer of VGG-Net) losses, so that it results 
into outputs with better objective quality. Motivated from SRGAN 
[5] , our second network has the same architecture as the ﬁrst one 
and it is trained with a combination of VGG loss and adversarial 
loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image 
manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differen- 
tiate between the super-resolved images and original real HR im- 
ages. The loss functions are described next.

52,Scale-Recurrent Multi-Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution,"Abstract.
Recent advances in the design of convolutional neural net-
work (CNN) have yielded signiﬁcant improvements in the performance of
image super-resolution (SR). The boost in performance can be attributed
to the presence of residual or dense connections within the intermediate
layers of these networks. The eﬃcient combination of such connections
can reduce the number of parameters drastically while maintaining the
restoration quality. In this paper, we propose a scale recurrent SR archi-
tecture built upon units containing series of dense connections within a
residual block (Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs)) that allow extraction of
abundant local features from the image. Our scale recurrent design deliv-
ers competitive performance for higher scale factors while being paramet-
rically more eﬃcient as compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.
To further improve the performance of our network, we employ multiple
residual connections in intermediate layers (referred to as Multi-Residual
Dense Blocks), which improves gradient propagation in existing layers.
Recent works have discovered that conventional loss functions can guide a
network to produce results which have high PSNRs but are perceptually
inferior. We mitigate this issue by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Net-
work (GAN) based framework and deep feature (VGG) losses to train our
network. We experimentally demonstrate that diﬀerent weighted combi-
nations of the VGG loss and the adversarial loss enable our network
outputs to traverse along the perception-distortion curve. The proposed
networks perform favorably against existing methods, both perceptually
and objectively (PSNR-based) with fewer parameters."
52,Multi-scale image denoising while preserving edges in sparse domain,"ABSTRACT
Image denoising is a classical and fundamental problem in
image processing community. An important challenge in im-
age denoising is to preserve image details while removing
noise. However, most of the approaches depend on smooth-
ness assumption of natural images to produce results with
smeared edges, hence, degrading the quality. To address this
concern, we propose two constraints to better preserve the
edges while denoising the image via the sparse representa-
tion framework. The ﬁrst constraint attempts to preserve the
edges at the coarser scales of the image as the level of noise
drop dramatically at coarser scales. Diﬀerent levels of scales
are considered to account diﬀerent strength of noise. The sec-
ond constraint prevents transitional smoothing by preserving
the edges of intermediate image estimates across iterations.
Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed
approach in removing noise while preserving edges in com-
parison to the state-of-the art approaches."
52,Depth Map Restoration From Undersampled Data,"Abstract—Depth map sensed by low-cost active sensor is often
limited in resolution, whereas depth information achieved from
structure from motion or sparse depth scanning techniques may
result in a sparse point cloud. Achieving a high-resolution (HR)
depth map from a low resolution (LR) depth map or densely
reconstructing a sparse non-uniformly sampled depth map are
fundamentally similar problems with different types of upsam-
pling requirements. The ﬁrst problem involves upsampling in a
uniform grid, whereas the second type of problem requires an
upsampling in a non-uniform grid. In this paper, we propose a
new approach to address such issues in a uniﬁed framework,
based on sparse representation. Unlike, most of the approaches
of depth map restoration, our approach does not require an HR
intensity image. Based on example depth maps, sub-dictionaries
of exemplars are constructed, and are used to restore HR/dense
depth map. In the case of uniform upsampling of LR depth
map, an edge preserving constraint is used for preserving
the discontinuity present in the depth map, and a pyramidal
reconstruction strategy is applied in order to deal with higher
upsampling factors. For upsampling of non-uniformly sampled
sparse depth map, we compute the missing information in local
patches from that from similar exemplars. Furthermore, we also
suggest an alternative method of reconstructing dense depth
map from very sparse non-uniformly sampled depth data by
sequential cascading of uniform and non-uniform upsampling
techniques. We provide a variety of qualitative and quantitative
results to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach for depth
map restoration.

54,High Resolution Frequency Measurement Techniques for Relaxation Oscillator Based Capacitive Sensors,"Abstract—This work presents high resolution and adapt-
able frequency measurement techniques for relaxation oscil-
lator based capacitive sensors. The techniques rely on
extremely simple hardware such as a 1-bit coarse voltage
quantizer to generate a 1-bit data stream and subsequently
determine frequencies with resolutions greater than 20 bits
from the 1-bit data stream. The proposed readouts are based
on two types of 1-bit hardware approaches with Nyquist sam-
pling in one approach and oversampling in the other. The ﬁrst
approach employs a Nyquist rate sampled 1-bit comparator
while the second approach relies on an oversampled 1-bit
quantizer based delta-sigma modulator (DSM) as a hardware
to generate the bit stream. High resolution frequency is esti-
mated from the 1-bit data stream using parametric, non-parametric and compressed sensing approaches. We provide
detailed study and measurement results comparing the performance of the proposed techniques for test inputs with
different frequencies and amplitudes and multiple signal shapes including sine, square, triangular and sawtooth. We show
that the 1-bit comparator along with the CS approach provides the best performance across all input amplitude, frequency
and shapes. A capacitive water level sensor was implemented in a PCB and embedded in a conventional square wave
relaxation oscillator to verify the proposed technique. Measurement results show that incremental SNRs can be achieved
only by increasing the 1-bit data stream length without any change in the hardware thereby demonstrating the adaptability
of the technique based on an application requirement."
54,An Acoustic 3-D Positioning System for Robots Operating Underground,"Abstract—Underground robots are potentially helpful in many application domains, including geotechnical engineering,
agriculture, and archaeology. One of the critical challenges in developing underground robotics is the accurate estimation
of the positions of the robots. Acoustic-based positioning systems have been explored for developing an underground 3-D
positioning system. However, the positioning range is limited due to attenuation in the medium. This letter proposes
an underground positioning system that utilizes a novel and easy-to-implement electronic approach for measuring
the acoustic propagation times between multiple transmitters and a receiver. We demonstrate a prototype using four
transmitters at the surface and a single buried acoustic sensor as a proof of concept. The times of arrival for signals
emitted by the different sources are measured by correlating the transmitted and received signals. The distances between
the multiple transmitters and a receiver are estimated, and a trilinearization algorithm is used to estimate the position of the
buried sensor in 3-D with respect to reference coordinates. The system is tested in a soil tank. The experimental results
show that the proposed system is able to estimate the 3-D position of buried sensors with an error of less than ±2.5 cm
within a measurement ﬁeld of size 50 × 50 × 35 cm in X, Y, and Z (width × length × depth). The proposed electronic
synchronization approach allows increasing the positioning range of the system by increasing the number of transmitters
at the surface. This paves the way for the development of a positioning system for robots operating underground."
54,Comparative Study and Experimental Validation of Phase-Sensitive-Detection Techniques for Sensor Lock-in Amplifiers,"Abstract—Often in a sensor system, the signal of interest from
the sensor is smaller than the signal due to noise. Lock-in
amplifiers have been used to efficiently differentiate the signal
of interest from noise and unwanted signals in such scenarios.
Phase-sensitive detection (PSD) is an important building block
of a lock-in amplifier. Analog switches and multipliers are
the two most widely used techniques for the phase-sensitive
detection of sensor lock-in amplifiers. Each technique has some
distinct advantages and disadvantages as well. In this paper, we
have studied and experimentally validated the performance of
these two techniques for the PSD in sensor lock-in amplifiers.
The techniques are validated with a sine wave, square-wave
excitation, and modulation signals. Further, the methods are
validated by integrating with a lock-in amplifier. Finally, the
performance analysis of these two techniques is tabulated based
on the obtained experimental results. The results show that the
multiplier-based system shows an error of less than 1%, whereas
the square-wave excitation system shows an error as high as 5%."
54,Development of Time-Multiplexed Magnetic-Induction Based Ranging Systems,"Abstract—Ranging and locating systems are necessary cur-
rently. Localization of robots operating underground, miners
and machinery in mining environments, and interior environ-
ments are few applications that demand a reliable and accurate
positioning system. Magnetic-induction (MI) based ranging and
positioning system is widely used in such applications because
the magnetic permeability of different mediums are almost
same. However, the MI based system are complex since multiple
transmitters are needed for accurate ranging and positioning.
In this paper, we present a time division multiplexing MI based
ranging system. A single signal source is needed to excite the
magnetic coil sequentially. A prototype is developed and tested
for a range of 1 meter with an error less than ±2 cm."
54,Development and Validation of Offset Current Compensation Technique for Optical Sensors,"Abstract—Optical sensors are widely used in a variety of indus-
trial, scientific and healthcare applications. The offset current due
to ambient light affects the overall performance of such sensor
system. This is even more critical in biomedical applications such
as photoplethysmography (PPG) and functional-near infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS). The continuous offset cancellation tech-
nique introduce the delay and affects the shape morphing of such
signals. In this paper, we present a mixed-signal based discrete
offset cancellation technique for effective compensation of the
offset current of the optical sensors for biomedical applications.
The system is based on a feedback loop which calibrate the offset
and compensate it at the start of recording. A prototype of the
system is built and tested for PPG signal recording. The results
shows that the proposed system is able to effectively compensate
the offset current."
54,A Resistance Change Detection Circuitry for Thread Based Resistive Sensors,"Abstract—Resistive pressure sensors such as strain gauge’s
have immense industrial applications due to low-cost and mod-
erate to high sensitivity. Their applications have grown recently
with the advancement in flexible resistive pressure sensors.
However, the resistance of these sensors is highly affected by
drift and offset resistance. Conventionally, voltage dividers and
Wheatstone bridge-based circuits have been used for interfacing
such sensors. However such interfacing circuits need calibration
for offset resistance compensation. But the problem due to drift
in resistance is still present. In this paper, a novel circuit is
proposed to compensate for the offset and drift of these sensors.
The proposed circuit detects the change in resistance using
auto- zeroing feedback loop. The proposed circuit is tested with
a fabricated thread-based pressure sensor for touch detection.
Experimental results show that R variations as low as 10 Ωcan
be detected with a wide range of sensor resistance measurement.
The error of measurement in sensor resistance is less than 1%."
54,A Compressed Sensing-based Resolution Reconfigurable Multi-Channel Sensor Node,"Abstract—Multi-channel sensor nodes are prevalent in a range
of applications including intelligent agriculture. Remote installa-
tion of such sensor nodes requires energy-efficient hardware as
well as remote servicing capabilities. Reconfigurable resolution
sensor nodes that are controlled via software help in remote
servicing, and debugging as well as reduced design development
time for a wide range of specifications. This work proposes
minimal hardware i.e., relaxation oscillator and D-flip flop-
based multichannel resolution reconfigurable sensor node. The
sensor network is realized using a hardware-software approach.
Compressed sensing approach-based frequency estimation on
the software side provides reconfigurability with zero hardware
change. We demonstrate a four-channel system incorporating
these hardware and software stacks and provide measurement
results showing software resolution reconfigurability."
54,A Current-Excitation Based Circuit for Resistive Sensors with Lead Resistance Compensation,"Abstract—IoT-assisted measurement systems form the back-
bone of any kind of automation system. Resistive sensors in such
systems are indispensable due to the ease with which they can
be interfaced and integrated with an IoT-based system. However,
in these systems, it is very commonplace to have a considerable
distance between the digital processors and the sensor. Corrective
measures, such as the 3 Wire or 4 Wire configuration, have been
used to cancel out the lead resistance. Such systems are mostly
based on DC-excitation signals. However, the DC-excitation-
based resistance measurement systems are affected by the non-
idealitities of the components, thermoelectric offset and offset
voltages. In this paper, a square wave current excitation-based
resistance measurement system for remotely connected resistive
sensors is presented. To overcome the limitations posed by the
large lead resistance the system is equipped with a 3-wire system.
The proposed measurement circuit is experimentally tested with
discrete resistances. The system can be programmed to work in
the low resistance measurement mode exhibiting a dynamic range
of 0.5Ωto 56Ωor the wide resistance measurement mode having
a range of 10Ωto 148Ω. It has been verified experimentally that
the measurement system is insensitive to lead wire resistance for a
change of 1Ωto 22Ω. The results show that the circuit can detect
variations in resistance as low as 4.75mΩwhile maintaining a
wide range of sensor resistance measurements with high linearity.
The measurement error of sensor resistance using the proposed
circuit is calculated to be less than 2% over the entire working
range."
54,Software Reconfigurable Frequency Readouts with Coarse Voltage Quantizers for Sensor Applications,"Abstract—Reconﬁgurable-resolution
sensor

with
no
hardware change is an exciting prospect for IoT applications.
Such sensor networks can be realized using hardware-software
approach where the sensor node has minimal hardware and the
reconﬁgurability is restricted to the gateway or the edge device
with only a software change. In this work, we present a 300
mV supply voltage, FFT based software reconﬁgurable frequency
readout for oscillator based reactance sensors. Measurement
results show that the readout technique provides excellent SNR
reconﬁgurability from 58 dB up to 120 dB using a 1-bit hardware."
54,Thread based Resistive Sensor for Tactile and Slippage Detection in Smart Bionics,"Abstract—One of the remarkable features of the human
tactile system is the perception of slippage over a diverse range
of object dimensions, weights, shapes, textures, and stiffness.
Advanced prosthetics strive for more natural and intuitive
performance, hence slippage anticipation and prevention being
indispensable for an artificial hand. Numerous sensor and circuit
topologies have been used in the state-of-the-art. Multi-modal
sensor integration for static and dynamic measurements, complex
design, wearability, sensitivity, hysteresis, and cost are still the
significant challenges faced. In this work, a simple, low-cost,
flexible thread-based resistive strain/force sensor is fabricated
and interfaced with a current source excitation-based resistance
measurement circuit. The sensor exhibits excellent performance
for slip detection by showing selectivity to the static and dynamic
measurements corresponding to the event of initial object contact
and slippage instances, respectively. The proposed circuit topol-
ogy promises better sensitivity, resolution, and baseline resistance
compensation, leveraging the system’s effectiveness for slippage
detection. Experimental result shows the sensor can measure a
displacement as small as 0.1 mm. This method can generate
further control actions for slippage prevention thereafter."
54,Current-Excitation Based &#x0394;<italic>R</italic>-to-Frequency Converter for Resistive Sensors,"Abstract— This paper presents a relaxation oscillator-based high-
resolution resistance measurement system. The proposed sig-
nal conditioning circuit utilizes a half-bridge topology with a bi-
directional current excitation. The circuit modulates the incremental
change in the sensor resistance in the form of a change in the
frequency of the relaxation oscillator. The baseline resistance of the
sensor is automatically compensated using a digital potentiometer
at the beginning of the measurement cycle. The proposed circuit
is analyzed in detail by considering the non-idealities of the circuit
components. The design consideration is provided for different
components. A prototype PCB of the proposed circuit is developed.
The results show that the proposed circuit can provide a signal-to-
noise ratio of 80 dB for a wide-range incremental change in the sensor resistance up to 500 kΩwith an error of less than
± 1%. The developed board is tested with humidity sensors. The result confirms the efficacy of the proposed circuit for a
wide measurement range."
54,Mismatch and Offset-Voltage Compensation Technique for Current Excitation Based Resistive Sensors Interface,"Abstract—Resistive sensors have been increasingly used in
a number of wearable biomedical applications ranging from
prosthetic control to electronic skin, thanks to their miniaturized
size. However, most resistive sensor systems suffer thermoelectric
offset, large baseline resistance, and drift in baseline resistance.
In addition, the system should be battery-operated and consume
low power. In this paper, we present a pulse current excitation-
based half-bridge mixed-signal interface circuit for accurate and
high-resolution resistance measurement of resistive sensors. The
circuit utilizes synchronous demodulation and a DC-Servo loop
to compensate for the offset and mismatch to enhance the
accuracy and measurement range. The circuit provides a linear
output voltage proportional to the incremental change in sensor
resistance. A prototype of the proposed system is developed and
tested. The circuit compensates offset-voltage as high as ±"
54,Visible Light-Based Synchronization Method for Acoustic Positioning in Underground Mines,"Abstract—The underground mining environment is one of the
most hazardous for workers. Monitoring the miner’s location
precisely is essential for the miner’s safety in this situation. Roof
collapses, toxic gas releases and crashes of vehicles in mines are
some of the factors that make this occupation more hazardous
to human life than others. In order to determine the location
of miners, however, a positioning system must be accurate
and precise. The synchronization signal between transmitters
and receivers is crucial in emergency situations. By using the
synchronization signal, it is possible to prevent both data loss and
misinterpretation. This article describes a method for combining
visible light with an acoustic-based 2D positioning system. The
developed proof-of-concept makes use of loudspeakers and a
microphone as an acoustic transmitter and receiver, respectively.
In addition, LED and LDR are used as transmitter and receiver
for visible light. Using a timer circuit, synchronization has been
achieved, and the transmitters are turned on sequentially using
time division multiplexing. For the safety of miners, the system
establishes the viability of using visible light as a synchronization
signal and locates the miner with an error of ± 3 cm."
54,A Review on Non-RF Underground Positioning Techniques for Mining Applications,"Abstract— Positioning systems are widely used to determine
the location of objects or individuals in a given environment.
In underground mines, these systems are used to track the
location of miners and equipment and ensure that they operate in
safe and efficient areas. It allows mine operators to monitor the
whereabouts of personnel and equipment and to respond quickly
to emergencies. In addition, accurate positioning information can
optimize mining operations, improve equipment utilization, and
reduce costs. Global positioning systems are not suitable for
the underground environment. The ultrahigh-frequency (UHF)-
based systems are also unsuitable due to extreme attenuation.
The non-radio frequency (non-RF) techniques are preferred for
underground mining due to their relatively small attenuation
and interference caused by the surrounding rock and mineral
formations in an underground mine that can occur with radio
frequency (RF) signals. This allows for more accurate and reliable
positioning within the mine. This research article compares non-
RF techniques, such as magnetic induction, visible light, and
acoustic, for positioning within an underground mine. The study
evaluates each technique’s accuracy, reliability, and feasibility
and discusses their potential for use in underground mining
environments. Overall, the study highlights the importance of
considering multiple positioning options to optimize the safety
and productivity of underground mining operations."
54,Magnetic-Induction-Based Positioning System Using Dual Multiplexing Technique,"Abstract—Developing positioning systems for the underground environment is challenging, particularly if radio-frequency-
based techniques are used. Low-frequency magnetic-induction (MI)-based positioning systems are accurate both in indoor
and underground environments as the relative magnetic permeability of most of the materials in such environments is close
to unity. However, the positioning range of the MI-based systems is limited because of the attenuation of the artiﬁcially
generated quasi-static ﬁeld with distance. An incrementally deployed network using transmitters can be used to increase
the positioning range. However, the complexity of the system increases as the number of transmitters increases. Moreover,
identifying the contribution of each particular transmitter to the received signal becomes challenging. In this letter, we
present an MI positioning system using a dual-multiplexing technique. The proposed system combines both time-division
multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing for efﬁcient positioning. We developed a proof-of-concept prototype to
validate the proposed system. The experimental results show that the proposed system is able to estimate the 3-D
position with an error of less than ± 0.05 m within a measurement ﬁeld of size 1 m × 1 m × 0.45 m in X, Y, and Z (width
× length × depth). The proposed dual-multiplexing approach allows for increasing the positioning range by incrementally
deploying the transmitters."
55,Neural coding of autonomic functions in different states of consciousness,"Abstract 
Detecting signs of residual neural activity in patients with altered states of consciousness is a crucial issue for the cus-
tomization of neurorehabilitation treatments and clinical decision-making. With this large observational prospec-
tive study, we propose an innovative approach to detect residual signs of consciousness via the assessment 
of the amount of autonomic information coded within the brain. The latter was estimated by computing the mutual 
information (MI) between preprocessed EEG and ECG signals, to be then compared across consciousness groups, 
together with the absolute power and an international qualitative labeling. One-hundred seventy-four patients (73 
females, 42%) were included in the study (median age of 65 years [IQR = 20], MCS +: 29, MCS −: 23, UWS: 29). Electro-
encephalography (EEG) information content was found to be mostly related to the coding of electrocardiography 
(ECG) activity, i.e., with higher MI (p < 0.05), in Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome and Minimally Consciousness 
State minus (MCS −). EEG-ECG MI, besides clearly discriminating patients in an MCS − and +, significantly differed 
between lesioned areas (sides) in a subgroup of unilateral hemorrhagic patients. Crucially, such an accessible 
and non-invasive measure of residual consciousness signs was robust across electrodes and patient groups. Conse-
quently, exiting from a strictly neuro-centric consciousness detection approach may be the key to provide comple-
mentary insights for the objective assessment of patients’ consciousness levels and for the patient-specific planning 
of rehabilitative interventions."
55,Multiplexing Biosensor for the Detection of Extracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers of Tissue Damage and Recovery after Ischemic Stroke,"Abstract: The inﬂammatory, reparative and regenerative mechanisms activated in ischemic stroke
patients immediately after the event cooperate in the response to injury, in the restoration of functions
and in brain remodeling even weeks after the event and can be sustained by the rehabilitation
treatment. Nonetheless, patients’ response to treatments is difﬁcult to predict because of the lack
of speciﬁc measurable markers of recovery, which could be complementary to clinical scales in
the evaluation of patients. Considering that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are carriers of multiple
molecules involved in the response to stroke injury, in the present study, we have identiﬁed a panel
of EV-associated molecules that (i) conﬁrm the crucial involvement of EVs in the processes that
follow ischemic stroke, (ii) could possibly proﬁle ischemic stroke patients at the beginning of the
rehabilitation program, (iii) could be used in predicting patients’ response to treatment. By means
of a multiplexing Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging biosensor, subacute ischemic stroke patients
were proven to have increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
and translocator protein (TSPO) on the surface of small EVs in blood. Besides, microglia EVs and
endothelial EVs were shown to be signiﬁcantly involved in the intercellular communications that
occur more than 10 days after ischemic stroke, thus being potential tools for the proﬁling of patients
in the subacute phase after ischemic stroke and in the prediction of their recovery."

Disorders

Consciousness
(pDoC) has improved in the last decades. Currently, the
level of consciousness at admission to post-acute rehabili-
tation is diagnosed by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised
(CRS-R) and this assessment is also part of the used
prognostic markers. The consciousness disorder diagno-
sis is based on scores of single CRS-R sub-scales, each
of which can independently assign or not a speciﬁc level
of consciousness to a patient in a univariate fashion. In
this work, a multidomain indicator of consciousness based
on CRS-R sub-scales, the Consciousness-Domain-Index
(CDI), was derived by unsupervised learning techniques.
The CDI was computed and internally validated on one
dataset (N=190) and then externally validated on another
dataset (N=86). Then, the CDI effectiveness as a short-term
prognostic marker was assessed by supervised Elastic-Net
logistic regression. The prediction accuracy of the neuro-
logical prognosis was compared with models trained on the

55,Can Respiration Complexity Help the Diagnosis of Disorders of Consciousness in Rehabilitation?,"Abstract: Background: Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, as cardiac, respiratory and
electrodermal activity, has been shown to provide speciﬁc information on different consciousness
states. Respiration rates (RRs) are considered indicators of ANS activity and breathing patterns are
currently already included in the evaluation of patients in critical care. Objective: The aim of this
work was to derive a proxy of autonomic functions via the RR variability and compare its diagnostic
capability with known neurophysiological biomarkers of consciousness. Methods: In a cohort of sub-
acute patients with brain injury during post-acute rehabilitation, polygraphy (ECG, EEG) recordings
were collected. The EEG was labeled via descriptors based on American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society terminology and the respiration variability was extracted by computing the Approximate
Entropy (ApEN) of the ECG-derived respiration signal. Competing logistic regressions were applied
to evaluate the improvement in model performances introduced by the RR ApEN. Results: Higher RR
complexity was signiﬁcantly associated with higher consciousness levels and improved diagnostic
models’ performances in contrast to the ones built with only electroencephalographic descriptors.
Conclusions: Adding a quantitative, instrumentally based complexity measure of RR variability to
multimodal consciousness assessment protocols may improve diagnostic accuracy based only on
electroencephalographic descriptors. Overall, this study promotes the integration of biomarkers
derived from the central and the autonomous nervous system for the most comprehensive diagnosis
of consciousness in a rehabilitation setting."

55,Predicting Long-Term Recovery of Consciousness in Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness Based on Coma Recovery Scale-Revised Subscores: Validation of a Machine Learning-Based Prognostic Index,"Abstract: Prognosis of prolonged Disorders of Consciousness (pDoC) is inﬂuenced by patients’
clinical diagnosis and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) total score. We compared the prognostic
accuracy of a novel Consciousness Domain Index (CDI) with that of clinical diagnosis and CRS-R total
score, for recovery of full consciousness at 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-injury. The CDI was obtained
by a combination of the six CRS-R subscales via an unsupervised machine learning technique. We
retrospectively analyzed data on 143 patients with pDoC (75 in Minimally Conscious State; 102 males;
median age = 53 years; IQR = 35; time post-injury = 1–3 months) due to different etiologies enrolled
in an International Brain Injury Association Disorders of Consciousness Special Interest Group (IBIA
DoC-SIG) multicenter longitudinal study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to assess
the association between outcomes and the CDI, compared to clinical diagnosis and CRS-R. The CDI,
the clinical diagnosis, and the CRS-R total score were signiﬁcantly associated with a good outcome at
6, 12 and 24 months. The CDI showed the highest univariate prediction accuracy and sensitivity, and
regression models including the CDI provided the highest values of explained variance. A combined
scoring system of the CRS-R subscales by unsupervised machine learning may improve clinical ability
to predict recovery of consciousness in patients with pDoC."
55,EEG-based methods for recovery prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness: A systematic review,"abstracts, followed by the full texts. A
fourth reviewer (AM) was involved if a disagreement occurred.
During this phase, only papers in English were considered eligible
for screening. The selection concerning outcomes was not applied
during the search phase; it was performed in the screening phase
only.
Moreover, studies included by other reviews close to our topic
were analysed (Bai et al., 2020; Wutzl et al., 2021), through which
three additional papers were included (Bai et al., 2019; Bareham
et al., 2020; Formisano et al., 2019b).
2.3. Data collection
For the data collection, the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and
data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling
Studies (CHARMS) was used (Moons et al., 2014). The following
data were extracted from the included studies:
- Source of data (authors’ names and year of publication);
- Participant characteristics (age, number, consciousness stratiﬁ-
cation, aetiology, time from event, and presence of epilepsy);
- Setting (monocentric or multicentric, number of electrodes,
sampling frequency, and signal duration);
- Study design (randomised controlled trial [RCT] or non-RCT);
- Stimuli (auditory, visual, electric, tactile, transcranial direct cur-
rent stimulation [tDCS], transcranial magnetic stimulation
[TMS], and others);
- Methods (preprocessing ﬁlters and segmentation parameters,
analysed domain, model type, model performances, and fre-
quency band);
- Features (measures used to quantify an independent variable);
- Outcomes (measures used to evaluate a dependent variable and
its timing).
2.4. Data synthesis
Only the content of papers that fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria
was used for the analyses. The results were displayed through nar-
rative data synthesis since, due to the heterogeneity of the meth-
ods
in
the
extraction
pipelines,
a
meta-analysis
was
not
applicable. For the same reason, the use of the PROBAST tool to
evaluate the methodological quality of prognostic studies was
not possible (Wolff et al., 2019).
Moreover, a PICO format was generally used to display the
results. First, a general description of the participants included in
the studies and the experimental setting was provided. Then, the
intervention types were displayed following the consecutive steps
of the analysis pipeline, namely the EEG signal preprocessing meth-
ods, the domain analysis performed (time, frequency, or both), the
EEG features extracted, and the data analysis used to identify candi-
date prognostic factors (Fig. 1). Lastly, a brief paragraph was dedi-
cated to the description of the outcomes. In line with the deﬁnition
of the string and selection criteria, the PICO component of ‘Com-
parison’ was not addressed in the results.
Regarding features, the results were presented distinguishing
between qualitative and quantitative features. In the case of the lat-
ter, additional categorisation was conducted as follows: evoked
potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs), spectral mea-
sures, entropy measures, and graph-theory measures.
2.5. Data availability
Data were extensively included within the manuscript and Sup-
plementary Material. However, a comprehensive version of the
data set with the data extracted from the included papers can be
obtained for research purposes by submitting a request to the cor-
responding author.

intensive rehabilitation is recommended to maximize functional recovery after sICH, no data are
available on whether CAA may affect rehabilitation outcomes. In this observational prospective
study, to explore the impact of CAA on rehabilitation results, functional outcomes after intensive
rehabilitation have been compared between patients affected by sICH with and without a diagnosis
of CAA. Methods: All adults affected by sABI due to sICH and admitted to the IRU of IRCCS-Don-
Gnocchi-Foundation were consecutively enrolled for 12 months. Demographic and clinical data were
recorded upon admission and discharge. Results: Among 102 sICH patients (age: 66 (IQR = 16),
53% female), 13% were diagnosed as probable/possible-CAA. TPO and functional assessment were
comparable upon admission, but CAA patients were signiﬁcantly older (p = 0.001). After a comparable
LOS, CAA patients presented higher care burden (ERBI: p = 0.025), poorer functional recovery (FIM:
p = 0.02) and lower levels of global independence (GOSE > 4: p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, CAA
was signiﬁcantly correlated with a lower FIM (p = 0.019) and a lower likelihood of reaching GOS-E > 4,
(p = 0.041) at discharge, independently from age. Conclusions: CAA seems to be independently
associated with poorer rehabilitation outcomes, suggesting the importance of improving knowledge
about CAA to better predict rehabilitation outcomes."
55,Cross-validation of predictive models for functional recovery after post-stroke rehabilitation,"Abstract 
Background:  Rehabilitation treatments and services are essential for the recovery of post-stroke patients’ functions; 
however, the increasing number of available therapies and the lack of consensus among outcome measures com-
promises the possibility to determine an appropriate level of evidence. Machine learning techniques for prognostic 
applications offer accurate and interpretable predictions, supporting the clinical decision for personalised treatment. 
The aim of this study is to develop and cross-validate predictive models for the functional prognosis of patients, high-
lighting the contributions of each predictor.
Methods:  A dataset of 278 post-stroke patients was used for the prediction of the class transition, obtained from the 
modified Barthel Index. Four classification algorithms were cross-validated and compared. On the best performing 
model on the validation set, an analysis of predictors contribution was conducted.
Results:  The Random Forest obtained the best overall results on the accuracy (76.2%), balanced accuracy (74.3%), 
sensitivity (0.80), and specificity (0.68). The combination of all the classification results on the test set, by weighted 
voting, reached 80.2% accuracy. The predictors analysis applied on the Support Vector Machine, showed that a good 
trunk control and communication level, and the absence of bedsores retain the major contribution in the prediction 
of a good functional outcome.
Conclusions:  Despite a more comprehensive assessment of the patients is needed, this work paves the way for the 
implementation of solutions for clinical decision support in the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. Indeed, offering 
good prognostic accuracies for class transition and patient-wise view of the predictors contributions, it might help in 
a personalised optimisation of the patients’ rehabilitation path."
55,Consciousness-Domain Index: a data-driven clustering-based consciousness labeling,"Abstract— Assessing consciousness results in one of the most 
complex neurological diagnosis. Even more complex and 
uncertain is prognosticating on consciousness recovery. 
Currently, consciousness is assessed by using a six-items scale, 
the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Namely, scores on the sub-
items can individually assign or not a specific level of 
consciousness to a patient. In our work, by using solely the six 
sub-items of the CRS-R, we implemented a clustering algorithm 
labeling patients with the Consciousness-Domains Index (CDI) 
starting from a dataset of 190 patients with a Disorder of 
Consciousness (DoC). Then, the CDI is compared with the 
clinical state at admission and at six months via univariate 
analysis. The number of clusters best dividing the groups 
resulted equal to two and the most influencing sub-items resulted 
the visual and motor one. The CDI closely resembles the clinical 
state at admission (CSA) (Cohen’s k = 0.85). On the other hand, 
when comparing CDI and CSA, a net improvement was found in 
the prognostic power of the neurological outcome at six months, 
targeted as presence/absence of a DoC (p < 0.001). 
Data-driven techniques pave the way for automated and 
model-based search of prognostic factors, together with the use 
of such prognostic factors in multivariate prognostic models. 
Future works will address the external validation of the CDI, 
together with the inclusion of the CDI in a multivariate 
supervised model, in order to assess the true potential of such 
novel index. 
 
Clinical Relevance— A completely data-driven index was 
derived from a clustering of CRS-R sub-items. It correlates with 
the neurological outcome at six months better than the state of 
consciousness at admission.

55,Cross-Validation of Machine Learning Models for the Functional Outcome Prediction after Post-Stroke Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation,"Abstract— The state of the art is still lacking an exten-
sive analysis of which clinical characteristics are leading to
better outcomes after robot-assisted rehabilitation on post-
stroke patients. Prognostic machine learning-based models
could promote the identification of predictive factors and be
exploited as Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). For
this reason, the aim of this work was to set the first steps
toward the development of a CDSS, by the development of
machine learning models for the functional outcome prediction
of post-stroke patients after upper-limb robotic rehabilitation.
Four different regression algorithms were trained and cross-
validated using a nested 5x10-fold cross-validation. The perfor-
mances of each model on the test set were provided through
the Median Average Error (MAE) and interquartile range. Ad-
ditionally, interpretability analyses were performed, to evaluate
the contribution of the features to the prediction.
The results on the two best performing models showed a MAE
of 13.6 [13.4] and 13.3 [14.8] on the Modified Barthel Index
score (MBI). The interpretability analyses highlighted the Fugl-
Meyer Assessment, MBI, and age as the most relevant features
for the prediction of the outcome.
This work showed promising results in terms of outcome prog-
nosis after robot-assisted treatment. Further research should
be planned for the development, validation and translation into
clinical practice of CDSS in rehabilitation.
Clinical relevance— This work establishes the premises for
the development of data-driven tools able to support the
clinical decision for the selection and optimisation of the robotic
rehabilitation treatment.

55,Effects of control strategies on gait in robot-assisted post-stroke lower limb rehabilitation: a systematic review,"Abstract 
Background:  Stroke related motor function deficits affect patients’ likelihood of returning to professional activities, 
limit their participation in society and functionality in daily living. Hence, robot-aided gait rehabilitation needs to be 
fruitful and effective from a motor learning perspective. For this reason, optimal human–robot interaction strategies 
are necessary to foster neuroplastic shaping during therapy. Therefore, we performed a systematic search on the 
effects of different control algorithms on quantitative objective gait parameters of post-acute stroke patients.
Methods:  We conducted a systematic search on four electronic databases using the Population Intervention Com-
parison and Outcome format. The heterogeneity of performance assessment, study designs and patients’ numeros-
ity prevented the possibility to conduct a rigorous meta-analysis, thus, the results were presented through narrative 
synthesis.
Results:  A total of 31 studies (out of 1036) met the inclusion criteria, without applying any temporal constraints. No 
controller preference with respect to gait parameters improvements was found. However, preferred solutions were 
encountered in the implementation of force control strategies mostly on rigid devices in therapeutic scenarios. Con-
versely, soft devices, which were all position-controlled, were found to be more commonly used in assistive scenarios. 
The effect of different controllers on gait could not be evaluated since conspicuous heterogeneity was found for both 
performance metrics and study designs.
Conclusions:  Overall, due to the impossibility of performing a meta-analysis, this systematic review calls for an 
outcome standardisation in the evaluation of robot-aided gait rehabilitation. This could allow for the comparison of 
adaptive and human-dependent controllers with conventional ones, identifying the most suitable control strategies 
for specific pathologic gait patterns. This latter aspect could bolster individualized and personalized choices of control 
strategies during the therapeutic or assistive path."
55,Machine learning methods for functional recovery prediction and prognosis in post-stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review,"Abstract 
Background:  Rehabilitation medicine is facing a new development phase thanks to a recent wave of rigorous 
clinical trials aimed at improving the scientific evidence of protocols. This phenomenon, combined with new trends 
in personalised medical therapies, is expected to change clinical practice dramatically. The emerging field of Reha-
bilomics is only possible if methodologies are based on biomedical data collection and analysis. In this framework, the 
objective of this work is to develop a systematic review of machine learning algorithms as solutions to predict motor 
functional recovery of post-stroke patients after treatment.
Methods:  We conducted a comprehensive search of five electronic databases using the Patient, Intervention, Com-
parison and Outcome (PICO) format. We extracted health conditions, population characteristics, outcome assessed, 
the method for feature extraction and selection, the algorithm used, and the validation approach. The methodo-
logical quality of included studies was assessed using the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). 
A qualitative description of the characteristics of the included studies as well as a narrative data synthesis was 
performed.
Results:  A total of 19 primary studies were included. The predictors most frequently used belonged to the areas of 
demographic characteristics and stroke assessment through clinical examination. Regarding the methods, linear and 
logistic regressions were the most frequently used and cross-validation was the preferred validation approach.
Conclusions:  We identified several methodological limitations: small sample sizes, a limited number of external vali-
dation approaches, and high heterogeneity among input and output variables. Although these elements prevented a 
quantitative comparison across models, we defined the most frequently used models given a specific outcome, pro-
viding useful indications for the application of more complex machine learning algorithms in rehabilitation medicine."

55,Predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection duration at hospital admission:a deep learning solution,"Abstract
COVID-19 cases are increasing around the globe with almost 5 million of deaths. We propose here a deep learning model 
capable of predicting the duration of the infection by means of information available at hospital admission. A total of 222 
patients were enrolled in our observational study. Anagraphical and anamnestic data, COVID-19 signs and symptoms, 
COVID-19 therapy, hematochemical test results, and prior therapies administered to patients are used as predictors. A set of 
55 features, all of which can be taken in the first hours of the patient’s hospitalization, was considered. Different solutions 
were compared achieving the best performance with a sequential convolutional neural network-based model merged in an 
ensemble with two different meta-learners linked in cascade. We obtained a median absolute error of 2.7 days (IQR = 3.0) 
in predicting the duration of the infection; the error was equally distributed in the infection duration range. This tool could 
preemptively give an outlook of the COVID-19 patients’ expected path and the associated hospitalization effort. The pro-
posed solution could be viable in tackling the huge burden and the logistics complexity of hospitals or rehabilitation centers 
during the pandemic waves."
56,Development of an Integrated CMUTs-based Resonant Biosensor for Label-Free Detection of DNA with Improved Selectivity by Ethylene-Glycol Alkanethiols,"Abstract: Gravimetric resonant-inspired biosensors have attracted increasing attention in industrial and point-of-care 
applications, enabling label-free detection of biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies. Capacitive micromachined 
ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) are promising tools for developing miniaturized high-performance biosensing 
complementary metal oxide silicon (CMOS) platforms. However, their operability is limited by inefficient 
functionalization, aggregation, crosstalk in the buffer, and the requirement for an external high-voltage (HV) power 
supply. In this study, we aimed to propose a CMUTs-based resonant biosensor integrated with a CMOS front-end 
interface coupled with ethylene-glycol alkanethiols to detect single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with large 
specificity. The topography of the functionalized surface was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray 
microanalysis. Improved selectivity for on-chip hybridization was demonstrated by comparing complementary and 
non-complementary single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides using fluorescence imaging technology. The sensor array 
was further characterized using a five-element lumped equivalent model. The 4-mm2 application-specific integrated 
circuit chip was designed and developed through 0.18 μm HV Bipolar-CMOS-Double diffused MOS (DMOS) 
technology (BCD) to generate on-chip 20V HV boosting and to track feedback frequency under a standard"

ducers (CMUTs) have widespread applications in ultrasonic
imaging, therapeutic treatment, and underwater applica-
tions. Reasonable design of their array structures essentially
determines the performance in aforementioned applications.
However, there is a lack of a systematic investigation on
the design strategies and effects of structure parameters
of CMUTs arrays, significantly impeding their performance
improvement. This article constructs explicit and accurate
analytical expressions for the main performances of CMUTs
arrays in immersion by introducing the accurate distributed
membrane deflection. Based on these theories, the influ-
ence laws of the aforementioned structure parameters on the
CMUTs array performances are analyzed and summarized in detail, including the transmitting power, receiving sensitivity,
focal length, beamwidth, and so on. These theories and array performance variation rules are well validated by finite
element method (FEM) simulations and experiment results of our fabricated CMUTs chips. It is demonstrated by the FEM
simulation that, under specific array structural parameters, the fill factor has a significant improvement effect on CMUTs
bandwidth (up to 173%). The multiarm spiral array and ring-shape array reduce the sidelobe level (62% less than that
of conventional square arrays) and improve the transmitting power and receiving sensitivity (35% and 33% larger than
those of conventional circular arrays), respectively. Based on these, CMUTs array design and optimization strategies
are provided for typical ultrasonic applications. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design and application of
CMUTs arrays in immersion, which will accelerate the development of CMUTs devices."
56,"Advances in high-performance MEMS pressure sensors: design, fabrication, and packaging","Abstract
Pressure sensors play a vital role in aerospace, automotive, medical, and consumer electronics. Although
microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based pressure sensors have been widely used for decades, new trends in
pressure sensors, including higher sensitivity, higher accuracy, better multifunctionality, smaller chip size, and smaller
package size, have recently emerged. The demand for performance upgradation has led to breakthroughs in sensor
materials, design, fabrication, and packaging methods, which have emerged frequently in recent decades. This paper
reviews common new trends in MEMS pressure sensors, including minute differential pressure sensors (MDPSs), resonant
pressure sensors (RPSs), integrated pressure sensors, miniaturized pressure chips, and leadless pressure sensors. To realize
an extremely sensitive MDPS with broad application potential, including in medical ventilators and ﬁre residual pressure

micro-electromechanical sensory platforms, offer an attractive
solution for real-time and facile monitoring of biomolecules due
to their high sensitivity and selectivity without the need for

including those involving nucleic acid and antibody. Among these,
capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have
emerged as a promising candidate for biosensing. However, their
usage is often limited by the requirement for high voltage supply
and continuous frequency tracking, which can result in signiﬁ-
cant parasitic effects and measurement errors. In this brief, we

56,Noninvasive fluid bubble detection based on capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers,"Abstract
Ultrasonic ﬂuid bubble detection is important in industrial controls, aerospace systems and clinical medicine because it
can prevent fatal mechanical failures and threats to life. However, current ultrasonic technologies for bubble detection
are based on conventional bulk PZT-based transducers, which suffer from large size, high power consumption and
poor integration with ICs and thus are unable to implement real-time and long-term monitoring in tight physical
spaces, such as in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems and dialysis machines or hydraulic systems
in aircraft. This work highlights the prospect of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) in the
aforementioned application situations based on the mechanism of received voltage variation caused by bubble-
induced acoustic energy attenuation. The corresponding theories are established and well validated using ﬁnite
element simulations. The ﬂuid bubbles inside a pipe with a diameter as small as 8 mm are successfully measured using
our fabricated CMUT chips with a resonant frequency of"
56,New Insights for Parasitic Effects of Label-Free Biosensors Based on Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers,"Abstract—Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transduc-
ers (CMUTs) are regarded as an attractive candidate in
bio-applications such as imaging and molecule monitoring.
However, the previous researches on biochemical sensing
are mostly air-coupled application based on a CMUTs array
because cell-to-cell mutual radiation and large motional loss
in liquid environment are able to produce nonignorable
noise. For a CMUTs cell, its characteristics (e.g., electrical,
mechanical, and acoustic) are susceptible to parasitic effects
owning to the physically capacitive dielectric dispersion,
motional damping, and connection loss. Neglecting the par-
asitic effects on multidomain characteristics of CMUTs leads
to signiﬁcant robustness errors. Furthermore, ﬁnite element
method (FEM) is not sufﬁcient enough to model such parasitic effects when considering an integrated circuit interface
and the evaluation of system responses. This article highlights a lumped element model (LEM) to analyze the behaviors of
a label-free biosensor based on a single CMUTs cell directly operating in liquid. We successfully explore the performance
of the biosensor with different types of parasitic effects in transient and frequency domains through LEM and FEM.
The parasitic effects on mass loading of sensing layer and biomolecule such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) probes are predicted by LEM based on their surface mass densities. The proposed approach is
capable of analyzing the variation’s margin of CMUTs-based biosensors to improve robustness for parasitic extraction in
liquid."

A

to improve bandwidth and realize multi-modes operating for 
immersed ultrasonic applications. The two-size (TS) CMUT 
array is composed of two sub-arrays with different membrane 
radii, but the same cell arrangement. The two sub-arrays are 
separately connected to external power sources to achieve 
separate control of each array. An electromechanical-acoustic 
coupling simulation model of the TS-CMUTs array is 
established by finite element method to investigate their 
impedance and conductance properties under different DC 
voltages in the frequency domain. The results indicate that the 
designed CMUTs can operate with a significant improved 
frequency bandwidth ranging from 9.75 MHz to 13.35 MHz 
by adjusting the DC bias voltage. Compared with traditional 
CMUTs arrays, the proposed CMUTs array can contribute to 
an increase of up to 270% in the bandwidth.

testing on the fabricated CMUTs chips are carried out to validate the analytical expressions. Parametric studies using the proposed 
analytical expressions are done to study the effects of CMUTs parameters on the electromechanical coupling coefficient. The 
relationship between the power consumption of CMUTs and the bias voltage is established. The results show that the analytical 
expressions for the CMUTs with circular and square membranes can accurately predict the electromechanical coupling coefficients 
under the bias voltages lower than 96% of the corresponding collapsed voltages. The electromechanical coupling coefficients decrease 
with the increasing height of the CMUTs cavities, while increase with the increasing radius under the same bias voltages. CMUTs 
with different parameters have the same electromechanical coupling coefficient under the same ratios of bias voltages to collapse 
voltages. In addition, from the study on the relationship between the power consumption and electromechanical coupling coefficient, 
it can be concluded that the performance requirements for both low power consumption and high electromechanical coupling 
coefficient can be coordinately achieved through reducing the collapse voltages or increasing the electromechanical coupling 
coefficient under low bias voltages.

56,A Novel Peninsula-island Structure for Sensing Ultra-low Pressure Based on Dry-wet Combination Etching Process,"Abstract—An 
improved 
peninsula-island 
structured 
pressure sensor was
presented with the
novel dry-wet 
combination etching process.
There were four pairs of 
segmented mass blocks attaching on the back of the diaphragm. 
Each segmented mass block was composed of a peninsula 
structure and an island structure with anisotropic-etching-
induced sidewalls. The improved structure not only inherited 
the stress concentration feature of low strain energy dissipation 
but also improved the comprehensive ability of the sensor chip, 
including low fabrication cost, high etching uniformity, good 
temperature performance and low residual stress in the 
diaphragm. Also, the fabrication method combining DRIE 
(Deep Reactive Ion Etching) and anisotropic wet etching was 
verified by the simulation based on the Sentaurus 2013. The 
fabrication error caused by anisotropic wet etching was 
analyzed. Compared with the flat film of the same size, the
proposed structure can increase the sensitivity by 225%, reduce 
the nonlinearity by 80.3%, and increase resonance frequency by
11%. In addition, the sensor structure can also be applied to 
pressure sensors with different working range, which will be 
helpful to design the pressure sensors with high efficiency and 
accuracy."

56,untitled,"Abstract— In this article, an analytical equivalent circuit
model is established for the piezoelectric micromachined
ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) cell and array with a com-
bination of the annular and circular diaphragms used for
structural optimization and complex array design. Based
on this model, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on
the acoustic-structural coupling of an annular and circular
diaphragm-coupled PMUT (AC-PMUT) with a new excitation
method. The model-derived results are in good agreement
with the simulation and experimental results. Then, an opti-
mized design has been presented to achieve high-output
pressure and a good array working performance. In sum-
mary, a comparison of the array working performance is
conducted between the arrays that consist of AC-PMUTs
and traditional circular diaphragm PMUTs (C-PMUTs). The
results indicate that the AC-PMUT array has a much lower
crosstalk effect than that of the traditional C-PMUT array.
By this means, the AC-PMUT array can fully use the high
vibration amplitude achieved by each AC-PMUT cell to
improve its output ability. As a result, the highest ultrasonic
output pressure generated by the AC-PMUT array in its res-
onant condition can achieve an increase of 155%, compared
with that generated by the C-PMUT array.

56,The Radial Piezoelectric Response from Three-Dimensional Electrospun PVDF Micro Wall Structure,"Abstract: The ability of electrospun polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) ﬁbers to produce piezoelectricity
has been demonstrated for a while. Widespread applications of electrospun PVDF as an energy
conversion material, however, have not materialized due to the random arrangement of ﬁbers
fabricated by traditional electrospinning. In this work, a developed 3D electrospinning technique is
utilized to fabricate a PVDF micro wall made up of densely stacked ﬁbers in a ﬁber-by-ﬁber manner.
Results from X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) demonstrate that
the crystalline structure of this PVDF wall is predominant in the β phase, revealing the advanced
integration capability of structural fabrication and piezoelectric poling with this 3D electrospinning.
The piezoelectric response along the radial direction of these PVDF ﬁbers is measured while the toppled
micro wall, comprised of 60 ﬁbers, is sandwich assembled with a pair of top/bottom electrodes.
The measured electrical output is ca. 0.48 V and 2.7 nA. Moreover, after constant mechanical
compression happening over 10,000 times, no obvious reduction in the piezoelectric response has
been observed. The combined merits of high-precision 3D fabrication, in situ piezoelectric poling,
and high mechanical robust make this novel structure an attractive candidate for applications in
piezoelectric energy harvesting and sensing."
56,The Design of a High Precision Capacitive Pressure Sensor Based on Comb Electrode,"Abstract— MEMS capacitive sensors promise wide applications in the ﬁeld of high precision
pressure sensing because of their low temperature drift, low power consumption and high preci-
sion. Based on the deformation principle of diaphragm under pressure, we present the design and
fabrication process of a novel high precision MEMS capacitive pressure sensor, which consists
of island-diaphragm composited structure and comb electrode. Furthermore, a ﬁnite element
simulation analysis is conducted to demonstrate the excellent performance of the sensor. The
simulation results show that the capacitance output non-linearity in load pressure range of 75–
125 kPa and 125–200 kPa are 0.083%FS and 0.074%FS, with the sensitivities of 9.3 fF/kPa and
10.6 fF/kPa, respectively."
56,Array Design of Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers With Low-Crosstalk and High-Emission Performance,"Abstract— This article presents a resonant cavity-based
array design for piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic
transducers (PMUTs). The cavity depth is designed to
ensure that its open end achieves a considerably smaller
acoustic impedance than the surrounding PMUT cells. The
interference acoustic wave generated between every two
adjacent PMUT cells at the near surface of the array will
take an easy path down to the cavity bottom. As such,
the crosstalk effect among different adjacent cells in the
array can be largely reduced. An equivalent circuit model
of the proposed array is established for its design and opti-
mization. In addition, the solutions for circuit parameters
in the electromechanical domain are analytically derived
and veriﬁed via FEM simulations. Given the low crosstalk
effect achieved by the proposed array design, the output

56,An Analytical Equivalent Circuit Model for Optimization Design of a Broadband Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer With an Annular Diaphragm,"Abstract—This paper presents an equivalent circuit model,
a systematic design, and optimization method for developing
a broadband annular diaphragm piezoelectric micromachined
ultrasonic transducer (A-PMUT). By utilizing array analysis
methods, an annular diaphragm is regarded as an array con-
sisting of equally spaced sector diaphragms inﬂuencing each
other by crosstalk effect. The model successfully explains the
phenomenon of multi-resonance peaks in the frequency response
curve, sharing the same vibration mode. The study ﬁnds that the
analytical predictions of the model are in good agreement with
the simulation and experimental results. Meanwhile, based on
the phenomenon of multi-resonance peaks, a systematic design
method is proposed to extend the bandwidth of the A-PMUT.
In this method, the radiation impedance of the A-PMUT is
separated into crosstalk-free and crosstalk contributed parts.
This method enables the determination of the optimal struc-
ture counting for the inﬂuences on the frequency response of
A-PMUTs for broadband applications. The model here can also
be further generalized to be a guideline for the design and
optimization of broadband PMUTs."
57,Forecasting Customer Churn in the Telecommunications Industry,"Abstract— Data mining is a broad field that helps the 
company to combine statistics, databases, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence. As the size of the 
company grows, so do such situations, making it 
impossible for a normal information system to manage 
such perilous scenarios. Due to this companies face 
significant income loss since customers are leaving the 
firm for unexplained reasons. It is well acknowledged that 
acquiring new clients is more cash intensive than 
maintaining 
existing 
ones 
and 
hence 
customer 
management is critically impacted by customer churn, 
which happens when a customer decides he no longer 
wants to keep in touch with the company. Traditional 
market research methodologies are challenging to 
support the churn problem. There is still much potential 
for improvement in churn forecast accuracy despite the 
development of several churn prediction tools that look at 
hundreds of parameters. Ultimately, this research will aid 
in the analysis of consumer behavior and the 
categorization of whether or not a client is churning 
through the use of a variety of data mining approaches to 
predict customer churn. Using a data set available on 
Kaggle's website, this study tested multiple classifiers on 
the problem of predicting customers' propensity to leave 
a company. In this study, we utilized Kaggle's online data 
set to predict customer churn behavior using several 
classifiers, including Random Forest, Logistic, J48, 
Stacking, ADA Boost, Decision Table, and Logit Boost, 
and observed that our model achieved 93.55 percent 
accuracy."
57,Analysis of Defect Classification Approaches for Fabric Images based on Four DFT Sector Features,"Abstract— Textile is an integral part of human society. The 
Textile industry drastically needs a solution to detect and classify 
defects present in any fabric. This will help the quality control 
mechanism of fabric manufacturing and processing units. 
Various types of flaws such as oil stains, punches, thread 
condensation, etc. may get introduced in the fabric; intentionally 
or unintentionally.  These or many such examples of errors 
present in cloth made up of different kinds of materials such as 
Silk, Jute, etc. So it is need of the hour to understand the 
relationship between the fabric material and defect types. An 
effective mechanism can be developed to point out the specific 
features required for accurate classification of defects. In this 
paper, we have experimented with various classification 
algorithms to classify the defects based on proposed DFT 
features. These ranked results can be further analyzed for better 
categorization. We have used TILDA Fabric databases 
containing 3200 images of the following fabric materials: Silk, 
Jute, Diamond pattern, and Flower pattern with seven different 
types of defects such as Oil stains, punches, thread condensation, 
foreign body, wrinkles, camera distortion and lighting conditions 
for this experimentation. Results are analyzed based on 
subjective and objective analysis methods. It has been observed 
that Flower and Diamond pattern fabric materials have closer 
classification rates after applying SVM, Grid Search, and 
Random Forest algorithms. At the same time, oil stains and 
punches, these defects are found to be have an average 
classification rates similar to each other across all fabric types 
and classification methods."
57,Defect Classification for Silk Fabric Based on Four DFT Sector Features,"Abstract— We cannot imagine a world without textile and 
textile industry. Vital role is played by textile industry in 
today’s world of business. Quality inspection, reliability, 
durability and fabric with less defects are an important factors 
for good apparel organizations. Fabric defect classification 
holds an inimitable position in demand of worthy products. In 
this paper we have experimented to classify the fabric defects 
for silk material based on its structural failures. We have used 
the DFT sectorization process on TILDA textile images to 
extract features in order to classify the defects. The Feature 
Vector Database (FVDB) is generated by means of four DFT 
sectors. FVDB is used as input in WEKA for defect 
classification based on two test options i.e. 10-fold cross 
validation and full training set. It has been observed that the 
rate of classification for silk cloth declines in 10-fold cross 
validation 
as 
compared 
to 
full 
training 
set. 
 
All 
characterization calculations are analyzed dependent on their 
accuracy and Kappa statistics. It has been observed that the 
Random Forest is most efficient algorithm for defect 
classification for silk fabric due to its high rate of classification."
57,Review of back-propagation algorithms for defect elimination with proposed DMASIC methodology,"Abstract— In India textile industry holds an irreplaceable self- 
sustains position. The aptness of apparel organizations are based on 
numerous aspects like reliability, durability and increase in 
demand for good quality products with less number of defects. In 
our paper we have discovered hundred defects which are 
responsible for the degradation in cloth quality for textile 
industries.  This paper also attempts to review and present the 
detail study of fabric defects occurring at each level of textile 
manufacturing process starting from the raw material to the end 
product and its elimination using proposed DMASIC methodology. 
To reduce these defects at each level of textile manufacturing 
process with DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Improve, and Control) we introduce one more phase in it i.e. SORT 
phase after the analyses step resulting the DMASIC methodology. 
This phase of sorting categorizes the defects into three levels: 
minor, major and critical defects. After DMASIC Sort process we 
use automatic defect detection and classification process using 
artificial neural networks to get the various defects under knitted, 
woven, dyeing and finished category. To obtain the best results for 
neural networks we compare the four back-propagation training 
algorithm i.e. Simple Back Propagation, Levenberg-Marquardt, 
Conjugate Gradient, and Resilient Back Propagation. These 
algorithms are compared based on their speed, accuracy, 
convergence, implement complexity, and memory requirement. It 
has been observed that RPROP can be most efficient algorithm 
along 
with 
proposed 
DMASIC 
for 
defect 
detection 
and 
classification due to its high rate of convergence and robustness."
57,A Survey-Defect Detection and Classification for ,"Abstract: Textile industry is one of the largest and oldest sectors in 
the India and has a formidable presence in national economy in 
terms of output, investment and employment. Due to increasing 
demand for quality fabrics it is thus important to produce the defect 
free high quality fabric. Visual inspection system consumes a lot of 
time and are error prone. The price of the fabric is reduced to 45%-
65% due to presence of various defects. The purpose of this paper is 
to automate the detection and classification of texture defects by 
computerize software. The proposed method uses a statistical based 
approach for the inspection and detection of the defect on 
woven/knitted fabric collected from the textile industry. In this the 
images are acquired, pre-processed, restored and normalized to 
extract the statistical feature using computer vision. The extracted 
features are given an input to the artificial neural network decision 
tree classifier to compute the weighted factor for detecting and 
classifying the type of defects. An automatic defect detection system 
can increase the texture defect detection percentage and will reduce 
the fabrication and labour cost and improves the quality of the 
product."

          It has been widely seen that multimedia application has increased in hand held devices
such as mobile devices, cellular phones, PDA’s , mobile audio / video player etc. These
embedded devices and applications need a huge amount of power to function so improvement
in power in these devices has turned out an important issue. This paper presents a novel
approach for reducing the bit-width of the data used for the dynamic reconfiguration of the hand

held devices. Run time dynamic reconfiguration of hand held devices to maximize power
according to user is a significant area for research. Remote reconfiguration is possible only
when Request Processing Time is less. This is achievable only when majority of optimizations is
performed statically. The bit streams available after the static analysis and preprocessing are
used further for dynamic optimizations which will greatly reduce the runtime of the applications
which further reduces the power consumed by the devices. Thus the paper aims to propose a
new set of preprocessing algorithm in which the variables are identified based on different
usage patterns and the generated bit stream is further compressed using the Huffman
compression and Dynamic Huffman Coding.

57,,"Abstract. Now a days multimedia application has increased in handheld  
devices and these applications needs a lot of power to operate. Power consump-
tion is an important issue in these handheld devices, the problem starts when 
user feels that a device is running out-of-power. Dynamic reconfiguration of 
mobile devices to optimize power according to user is an active area for  
research. Further the remote reconfiguration of mobile devices is feasible only 
when Request Processing Time i.e. time required in sending the request, proc-
essing at remote server, transmission of new bit stream to mobile device and  
reconfiguration of mobile device as per the requested quality (RqoS) must be 
less. This is achieved through the static optimizations which greatly reduce the 
processing and response time of the server. The results available during static 
analysis and preprocessing are reduced further with the help of the Huffman 
compression. This will not only reduce the run time analysis of the application 
but also helps in optimizing power."
57,10 XII December 2022,"Abstract: This pandemic has not only affected the world physically but has also caused a major rise in the number of 
cyberattacks and cybersecurity breaches. In these trying times, the entire paradigm has shifted, forcing every individual to adapt 
to remote working. Since everything has shifted from its traditional offline methods to online portals, the online traffic has 
increased tremendously. This paper outlines how and why the number of cyberattacks have increased. Moreover, this paper 
provides real world cases where cybersecurity attacks have been used in order to extort personal information with numerous 
statistics and also sheds light upon various preventative methods one can adopt in order to prevent falling victim to any 
cybercrime. 
This paper is assembled into two parts. The first part highlights few of the most common cyberattacks which were observed to 
have upsurged manifold times during the COVID-19 pandemic and used excessively by cybercriminals to unethically derive the 
personal information of unsuspecting users for malicious reasons. These three main methods being phishing, malware and data 
breaches. The second part talks about ways and methods to prevent them."
57,Generic Wrapper Based Model using Haralick Features for Silk Fabric D efect ,"Abstract: Quality control unit of fabric industry looks for the effective defect detection methodology. The 
research is required to be done in this area to develop such solution. Various models based on 
combination of suitable feature extraction, selection and classification approaches need to be 
experimented out for the same. This paper attempts to experiment and provide such models mainly based 
on generic wrapper based selection approaches. Widely used broader range of Haralick features are 
prominently used for detection and classification of defects in this research. It also attempts to identify the 
suitability of these features based on segmented images provided as an input. The research has been 
carried on TILDA Dataset consisting of 800 Silk Fabric Images with eight different defects present on it 
and each carrying 100 images per defect. Models generated using generic wrapper based approach has 
also been compared with the Gabor Transforms. Then identification of suitable Haralick Features for 
particular type of defects has been carried out. In this 68% classification accuracy has been achieved

58,Nanoparticle‐Decorated Biomimetic Extracellular Matrix for Cell Nanoencapsulation and Regulation,"Abstract:
Cell
encapsulation
has
been
studied
for
various applications ranging from cell transplantation to
biological production. However, current encapsulation
technologies focus on cell protection rather than cell
regulation that is essential to most if not all cell-based
applications. Here we report a method for cell nano-
encapsulation and regulation using an ultrathin biomi-
metic extracellular matrix as a cell nanocapsule to carry
nanoparticles (CN2). This method allows high-capacity
nanoparticle retention at the vicinity of cell surfaces.
The encapsulated cells maintain high viability and
normal metabolism. When gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
are used as a model to decorate the nanocapsule, light
irradiation transiently increases the temperature, leading
to the activation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
promoter and the regulation of reporter gene expres-
sion. As the biomimetic nanocapsule can be decorated
with any or multiple NPs, CN2 is a promising platform
for advancing cell-based applications.
Cells
are
“living
factories”
that
can
actively
release
biomolecules.[1,2] For example, mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) can release a multitude of immunomodulatory
factors in response to inflammatory mediators.[3] Beta cells
in the islets can release insulin in response to glucose.[4]
Thus, live cells have been widely used as intelligent tools for
both in vivo and ex vivo applications.[5] However, cells are
fragile and easy to lose functions in the applications. When
cells are delivered in vivo for cell therapies, cells have to
face an immune attack if they are not autologous.[6] While
the immune attack is not a concern for ex vivo applications,
other factors such as shear stress are problematic. Thus, cells
need protection to ensure that their normal functions will
not be lost.
Encapsulation is currently the main concept developed
for cell protection.[7–9] Both microcapsules and nanocapsules
have been studied, depending on specific needs or methods
to be used. Microcapsules can be formed when cells are
suspended in a polymer solution and extruded from a
channel into a reaction solution.[10] Nanocapsules can be
formed by alternatively treating cells with positively and
negatively charged polymers using the layer-by-layer coating
method.[11] Both in vivo and ex vivo studies have shown that
microcapsules and nanocapsules can protect cells from
environmental attacks. In addition, cells in microcapsules or
nanocapsules face a minimal hurdle in nutrient and oxygen
transport due to the smaller geometry of the capsules
compared to those immobilized in bulk biomaterials. Thus,
cell encapsulation has been widely studied for applications
such
as
diabetes
treatment,
cancer
therapy,
biological
production, three-dimensional bioprinting, etc.[12–15]
Cells reside in the extracellular matrix (ECM).[16] The
ECM not only allows for cell immobilization and protection,
but also dynamically regulates cell functions through bio-
chemical and biophysical stimulation. The ECM and its
components have been widely used for cell culture and
regulation either in a three-dimensional space or on a two-
dimensional surface.[17] Therefore, in principle, microcap-
sules and nanocapsules can be designed to mimic the
functions of the ECM to regulate cellular functions. For
example, the Tsukruk group applied layer-by-layer to
develop polyelectrolyte nanocapsules and control the cellu-
lar functions by reversible charge variation on the cell
surface.[18] In addition to the biomimetic ECM, an exoskel-
eton-like nanocoating was also developed using inorganic
NPs.[19] Tannic acid-mediated interparticle binding and NP-
cell complexation led to virtually instantaneous coating of
cells. This nanocoating could not only protect cells, but also
control the replicative states of cells. In this work, we
studied the CN2 method for cell nanoencapsulation and
regulation with a NP-decorated biomimetic ECM. This
method harnesses the merits of both polymeric materials
and inorganic NPs. Polymeric nanocapsules are mechani-

cally soft, which is highly similar to the natural living
environment of most cells. Moreover, as NPs can be
designed with a diverse array of properties and functions,
there will be numerous options of regulating cellular
functions. Therefore, the decoration of nanocapsules or
microcapsules with NPs is expected to become a new
technology platform for the regulation of encapsulated
cells.[20]
The principle of CN2 is schematically illustrated in
Figure 1a. As cholesterol has been widely used to display
molecules (e.g., DNA) on the cell membrane,[21] DNA
initiator is anchored on the cell membrane through choles-
terol insertion. The initiator triggers the assembly of DNA1
and DNA2 to form a DNA nanostructure (Supporting
Information Figure 1, Supporting Information Figure 2, and
Supporting Information Table 1). A variety of DNA nano-
structures with a diverse array of shapes and geometries
have been studied.[22,23] Nanostructures in principle can be
further functionalized with any biomolecules to acquire new
functions.[24] Thus, when DNA2 is conjugated with alginate,
the DNA nanostructure can direct alginate display to form a
biomimetic nanocapsule around the cell through electro-
static crosslinking. The three-dimensional space of the
biomimetic nanocapsule can be further decorated with NPs
through conjugation.
We first used microparticles as a cell model to establish
the CN2 method. Quantum dot (QD) 525 was used as a
model of NPs as QD nanocrystals are highly bright and

ultrasound
transducer
(TUT)
technologyallows easy co-alignmentof optical and acoustic
beams in the development of compact photoacoustic
imaging (PAI) devices with minimum acoustic coupling.
However, TUTs suffer from narrow bandwidth and low
pulse-echosensitivity due to the lack of suitable transparent
acoustic matching and backing layers. Here, we studied
translucent glass beads (GB) in transparent epoxy as
an acoustic matching layer for the transparent lithium
niobate
piezoelectric
material-based
TUTs
(LN-TUTs).
The acoustic and optical properties of various volume
fractions of GB matching layers were studied using
theoretical calculations, simulations, and experiments.
These results demonstrated that the GB matching layer
has
signiﬁcantly enhanced the
pulse-echo sensitivity
and bandwidth of the TUTs. Moreover, the GB matching
layer served as a light diffuser to help achieve uniform
optical ﬂuence on the tissue surface and also improved the
photoacoustic (PA) signal bandwidth. The proposed GB
matching layer fabrication is low cost, easy to manufacture
using conventional ultrasound transducer fabrication tools,
acoustically compatible with soft tissue, and minimizes the
use of the acoustic coupling medium."

We demonstrate a passive measurement technique for interferometer path imbalance using homodyne PGC.
A 20.8 kHz frequency modulated optical source is employed to interrogate an unbalanced Michelson interfer-
ometer. The spectrum of the received photocurrent is then recorded for various frequency deviation values.
The variation in harmonic peak powers enables us to determine path imbalances. Different path imbalances
are estimated and veriﬁed against the pre-calibrated values. The measurement scheme proposed requires no
feedback and can be employed to passively measure path imbalances in interferometer sensor arrays already

59,Study on green synthesis characterization and electrical properties of cerium oxide (CeO2)-doped vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles for strain gauges,"ABSTRACT
Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is a transition metallic oxide which is suitable for
strain gauge application because of its good electrical properties and conduc-
tivity. Considering this, cerium oxide (CeO2)-doped vanadium oxide (V2O5)
nanoparticles are synthesized with the varied concentrations of 5, 10, and 15
wt%, to study its characteristics for fabrication of thin ﬁlm strain gauges. The
structural, transmission spectral, morphological, compositional and the electri-
cal properties of synthesized nanoparticles are characterized using XRD, FTIR,
SEM, HRTEM, EDX and CLR meter respectively. The characterization results
depict favorable changes within the nanoparticle samples on the addition of
dopant. The transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase orthorhombic
cubic structure is visible from the x-ray diffraction results. The morphological
data depict improvement in the structural appearance of the samples without
any cracks on its surface. The shift in transmission spectral peaks towards the
lower wave number indicates the improved electronic transitioning due to high
activation energy. The drastic improvement in its conductivity from 1 to 4.3
S/m, along with better temperature characteristics specially in case of 10-wt%
CeO2:V2O5, depicts the improved sensitivity of the samples. The resulting gauge
factor of 45.21 obtained through four-point bending arrangement highlights the
better strain resistance behavior of synthesized nanoparticles.

60,Studies on thermal comfort of multi-layered fabric assembly after wetting with sweat and distilled water,"Abstract
Textiles play a vital role in assuring the thermal stability of the human body. The absorption of
perspiration or moisture from a humid environment might result in wet clothing. Protective
and sports apparel are often wet when the wearer is involved in high level of activity; thereby
affecting the comfort. In order to understand the comfort behaviour of textiles in wet state,
most of the researchers used the distilled water or NaCl aqueous solution. However, human
sweat is a very complex aqueous mixture of chemicals comprising of salts, lipids, urea, lactic
acid, carbohydrates, and minerals. In the present study, the effect of simulated sweat solution
on the thermal behaviour of multi-layered fabric assembly is studied and compared with that
of distilled water. The multi-layered fabric assembly consists of breathable PU-coated nylon as
an outer layer; polyester knitted fabric as an inner layer; and micro-polyester wadding/hollow-
polyester wadding/spacer fabric as the middle layer. In addition, the inner layer (next to the
skin) is also tested for thermal comfort for both dry and wet states. It is observed that thermal
properties of fabrics are drastically affected under wet conditions. The inner layer of fabric
wetted with distilled water shows higher thermal conductivity as compared to that wetted
with simulated sweat. Among various multi-layered assemblies, the thermal resistance and
thermal diffusion of multi-layered assembly having hollow polyester wadding as a middle layer
is high as compared to that having spacer fabric in the middle, under both dry and wet
conditions."

(25.79%) and type of material (12.28%). At lower and medium slope angles (of 15o and 30o, respectively) the 
twill-woven structure of coir geomeshes provided better erosion control than plain- and satin-woven structures, 
while plain-woven jute geomeshes demonstrated better erosion control at all slope angles. To understand the 
overall impact, a germination test was also conducted. According to the germination test results, the twill weave 
of jute geomeshes provided the highest rooting length. In general, plain-woven jute geomeshes are preferred 
for better erosion control on a high slope angle, while plain and twill can be used on a low slope angle."

60,Impact of Positive Thread Feeding for High-Speed Industrial Lockstitch Sewing Machines: Part II Response with Cotton and Spun Polyester Needle Threads,"Abstract During high-speed industrial lockstitch sewing,
the dynamic, thermal, bending and abrasive loading of the
thread has a negative inﬂuence on the tensile properties of
sewing threads. For maximum strength retention of needle
thread, a positive thread feeding device is developed which
lowers the stitch tightening tension (or peak tensions). Two
types of threads, viz. mercerised cotton and spun polyester
threads of linear density 40 tex and 60 tex, are taken for
investigation. During conventional sewing, there is a sig-
niﬁcant loss in breaking force and elongation for cotton and
spun polyester threads. It is observed that loss in breaking
force is signiﬁcantly lower with positive thread feeding
device as compared to conventional sewing, whereas loss
in breaking elongation is signiﬁcantly lower in most of the
cases for both cotton and spun polyester threads. The peak
tensions observed during sewing with positive thread
feeding device are much lower than the conventional
sewing. The loss in breaking force and elongation for the
cotton threads during sewing is higher than that of spun
polyester threads in the case of both conventional sewing
and sewing with positive thread feeding device. In both the
cases, coarser threads show higher loss in breaking force
and breaking elongation during sewing as compared to
ﬁner threads. During conventional sewing, the initial
modulus of cotton threads decreases signiﬁcantly, while
there is a signiﬁcant gain in initial modulus of spun
polyester threads. With positive thread feeding device,
there is a signiﬁcant improvement in initial modulus for
cotton and spun polyester threads."

New technologies and materials required for developing antibacterial textiles have become a subject of inter­
est to the researchers in recent years. This study focuses on the investigation of the biopolymeric antibacterial 
agents, such as neem, aloe vera, tulsi and grapeseed oil, in the trichloroacetic acid-methylene chloride (TCAMC) 
solvent used for the pretreatment of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polyester fabrics. Different PET structures, 
such as 100% polyester, polyester/viscose, polyester/cotton and 100% texturised, are treated with four different 
concentrations (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of biopolymeric antibacterial finishes. The antibacterial activity of the 
treated samples is tested against both the Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-
negative) bacteria. Taguchi mixed orthogonal array Design L16 (4^3 2^2) is chosen for an experimental plan to 
determine the optimum conditions. Among all the fabric samples, the 100% polyester fabric treated with 20%

60,Impact of Positive Thread Feeding for High-Speed Industrial Lockstitch Sewing Machines: Part I Development of Device,"Abstract During high-speed industrial lockstitch sewing,
repeated stresses and strains on the needle thread adversely
inﬂuence its sewing performance. The sewing performance
of threads is affected by reduction in its tensile strength.
For maximum strength retention of needle thread, a posi-
tive thread feeding device is developed, which is inde-
pendent of the fabric feed mechanism as in conventional
sewing, where sewing thread is pulled from the cone
directly wherein the thread feed is controlled by spring disc
tensioner and needle movement. The dynamic needle
thread tension is measured above the needle bar using
strain gauge load cell. The load cell converts force or
weight into electrical signal. The highest thread tension
(stitch tightening tension) occurs when the take-up lever
pulls the required thread amount through the spring disc
tensioner. Positive thread feeding of needle thread lowers
the tightening tension (peak tension), and hence, strength
retention of needle thread is observed. In this paper, the
breaking force of mercerized cotton needle thread at vari-
ous sewing variables, viz. fabric density, number of fabric
layers, and stitch length, is studied during conventional
sewing and also by using positive thread feeding device.
The loss in breaking force increases with the increase in
fabric density, whereas it decreases as the number of fabric
layers and stitch length increased."

Friction forces play a very important role in performance of sewing thread during the sewing process.
Various ﬁnishes are applied over sewing threads to reduce the friction forces, which help in masking the
basic properties of sewing thread and reduce the yarn to metal friction and yarn to yarn friction. In this
paper, the eﬀect of lubrication (%) on tensile properties of sewing thread is measured at four sewing
stages: before sewing, after dynamic loading at the tension regulator, after passage through the needle
and fabric assembly, and after bobbin thread interaction. It is found that as the lubrication per cent
increases friction coeﬃcient decreases, in general. Due to this, the loss in tensile properties of the sewing
threads during sewing decrease.
Tenacity loss decreases during all sewing stages, as the lubrication
percentage increases."
60,Performance of Chemically Treated Jute Geotextile in Unpaved Roads at Different in situ Conditions,"Abstract Biodegradable jute geotextiles are an effective
reinforcing material for unpaved roads, but its service-
ability is limited because of faster microbial degradation.
Different methods are in use to improve the serviceability
of jute geotextiles. In this paper, inﬂuence of chemical
treatment (transesteriﬁcation and bitumen coating), road
design and rainfall intensity on the time dependent ser-
viceability of jute geotextiles has been studied. Chemically
treated jute geotextiles, were laid in unpaved road designs
with and without sand layer, for 30, 60 and 90 days’
duration, and subjected to simulated rainfall intensities of
50 and 100 mm/h. With increase in time of usage, tensile
strength and puncture resistance decrease due to microbial
attack, and pore size decreases due to clogging of soil in
jute geotextiles. Chemical treatment was observed to have
greater inﬂuence on the serviceability, followed by the
presence of sand layer in road design and the rainfall
intensity. Further, overall performance of bitumen coated
jute geotextiles was observed to be better than transester-
iﬁed jute geotextile, due to its hydrophobic nature."
60,Predicting Sewing Thread Consumption for Chainstitch using Regression Model,"Abstract
Prediction of sewing thread consumption required to sew a garment is important as it enables a reliable 
estimation of the garment cost and requirement of sewing thread. The sewing thread consumption for made-up end 
products is of equal interest to the sewing thread producer as to the garment maker. Referring to literature works, 
the most important factors that affect the sewing thread consumption are sewing thread type, stitch density, fabric 
thickness, number of fabric plies and fabric composition. Also, the researchers have provided models for predicting 
sewing thread consumption using specific set of parameters i.e., a given set of stitch densities, thickness of fabrics, 
for cotton threads or polyester threads or polyester cotton core spun threads separately. This study focuses on 
developing a single model which can predict the sewing thread consumption for cotton and polyester-cotton core 
spun threads for sewing medium weight cotton fabrics using stitch density, fabric assembly thickness and breaking 
elongation of sewing threads. Regression models were developed first for cotton and polyester cotton core spun 
threads separately, and then a combined model for cotton and polyester-cotton core spun thread was developed. 
The single model developed had a R2 of 0.956, which is quite equivalent to those of individual models for cotton and 
polyester cotton core spun threads.

cotton core spun threads of 105 tex (with 60 tex as looper thread) were 
used for modelling sewing thread consumption using different fabric 
assembly thickness(t) and stitch densities(n). In Table 1, the physical 
characteristics of the threads used. A 5 cm of the seam was produced 
on Juki chainstitch sewing machine at a speed of 3000 stitches/min 
on 2,4,6,8 layers of 2/1 twill denim fabric of 300 g/m2 and 350 g/m2 at 
different stitch densities. Number of fabric layers and fabric weight per 
unit area was used as a single independent parameter in terms of fabric 
assembly thickness. The balanced condition is achieved when needle 
thread penetrates completely into fabric assembly and looper thread 
forms loops with needle thread on the back surface of fabric assembly. 
The method of stitching and unstitching was used to measure the sewing 
thread Consumption. The study was carried out in two steps; in the first 
step, regression models for 105 tex cotton (REGcot) and 105 tex polyester 
cotton core spun threads (REGpolycot) were developed individually, 
and effect of different parameters on sewing thread consumption 
was studied. In the second step, after studying the difference in the

sewing thread consumption of cotton and polyester core spun threads, 
breaking elongation of the sewing threads was introduced as third 
factor and a single regression equation was developed for calculating 
sewing thread consumption for cotton and polyester-cotton core spun 
threads. In total, 24 samples were produced at different combinations 
of stitch density, fabric assembly thickness and breaking elongation for 
developing a single regression model. Analysis of variance was carried 
out to find out the contribution of different parameters on sewing 
thread consumption. The proposed single regression model was used 
to predict the sewing thread consumption for cotton and polyester core 
spun threads and results were compared with the models developed 
separately for cotton and polyester cotton core spun threads.
Results and Discussion
The sewing thread consumption for 105 tex cotton and polyester 
cotton core spun threads at different combinations of stitch density 
and fabric assembly thickness (Table 1). Regression models developed 
from the data given in Table 2. The coefficient of determination for 
cotton and polyester cotton core spun thread is 0.956 and 0.949 
respectively, which shows that the equations explain the relationship 
between the sewing thread consumption and the parameters (fabric 
assembly thickness and stitch density) very well. The equations were 
used to study the effect of different parameters on the sewing thread 
consumption and also predict the sewing thread consumptions.

consumption of cotton thread, polyester cotton thread and combined

density and fabric thickness. Absolute error is more than 0.5 in four

meta-atom design having near zero refractive index (RI) and 
its periodic metasurfaces that enhances the power transfer 
efficiency (PTE) of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system 
operating in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band 
(2.40 - 2.48 GHz). The proposed meta-atom has double 
transmission windows in the 1-6 GHz range covering the ISM 
band in its first transmission window. Due to the near zero RI 
property, this metasurface can convert any incident waves 
(spherical/ cylindrical) to planar waves upon transmission 
through it. Two circular microstrip antennas (CMSAs) having 
resonances at 2.42 GHz and 2.43 GHz in the ISM band are 
designed to set-up a WPT system. A 3×3 and a 4×4 metasurface 
have been designed using the proposed meta-atom that 
enhances PTE from 19.14% (-7.18 dB) to 24.66% (-6.08 dB). A 
step-by-step design procedure starting from the meta-atom up 
to the WPT system, along with the complete parametric study 
of the WPT system and a detailed physical analysis of the 
working of the meta-atom based on electromagnetic (EM) 
simulations, has been presented."

a metallic feeding strip sandwiched between two layers of the 
same substrate and directly connected to the center 
conductor of the coaxial feed. Due to the incorporation of the 
metallic feeding strip, effective electrical path length 
increases, which shifts the operating frequency to a lower 
frequency range on a large scale. As a proof of concept, an 
elliptical cavity is designed by conceiving this new feeding 
mechanism that helps to shift the lower cut-off frequency 
from 32.97 GHz to 23.67 GHz without increasing the size of 
the cavity-backed antenna. Further, focal feed, slot-loading 
at two focal points, and incorporation of the metallic rod at

61,Slotted patch and ground for reducing side lobe level of planar antenna operating under higher order mode,"Abstract
In this article, a novel technique based on the combined utilization of slots in patch and ground plane is proposed to reduce 
the side lobe level (SLL) in the E-plane of a square patch antenna operating at ­TM03 mode. The concept of beam reshap-
ing through surface current reorientation is explained in detail by an analytical model and the same is validated through 
simulated as well as measured results. The combination of a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR)–shaped slot, two 
plus-shaped slots on the patch and a plus-shaped defected ground structure (DGS), reduces the SLL by 14.7 dB and increases 
the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) and first null beamwidth (FNBW) by 21° and 42°, respectively, in comparison to the 
conventional square patch antenna. Starting from the basic expression of the E-plane radiation pattern of a square patch, 
an analytical model is invoked to modify this basic expression as per the structural modification to get the final expression 
for the proposed antenna structure. The physical insight for the stepwise modifications of the antenna structure is properly 
explained and justified. Analytical and simulated predictions are experimentally verified using a prototype. The simulated 
and measured results show a good agreement."

Gold patterns are designed over a quartz substrate which

Below the transition temperature, vanadium dioxide behaves as 
an insulator which allows transmission of electromagnetic

comprises a F-shaped microstrip patch antenna backed by 
copper grounded FR4 substrate. The edge spacing between the 
antennas is kept minimal for maintaining compactness which 
causes very high mutual coupling. A novel structure for MIMO 
has been proposed by introducing a T shaped stub equidistant 
from each of the edges of the antenna elements. Further, a 
defected ground structure (DGS) with L shaped slot surrounded 
by band-stop FSS unit cells has been employed for causing 13

to represent the dynamics of the diving motion system for depth position control. The control objective is to track the demanded
depth position in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. A control law based on the immersion and invariance (I&I)
technique is synthesized to achieve the control objectives. The proposed control law effectively tracks a stable, lower-order
target dynamic system immersed within a three-dimensional manifold. Additionally, the regulation problem is treated as a
specialized case of tracking, with a known depth serving as the reference input to be regulated. The performance of the
proposed control law is assessed through simulation studies that consider various scenarios. The simulation study evaluates
the robustness of the proposed control law resilience against modelling uncertainties and underwater disturbances. The

62,Computation of steady-state operating conditions of a DFIG-based wind energy conversion system considering losses,"Abstract
In this paper, steady-state operating conditions of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) are computed considering losses
of grid-side (GS) ﬁlter. Two different cases are studied for steady-state initialization of the DFIG-based wind turbine systems
(WTS). In the ﬁrst case, active power (P) and reactive power (Q) at DFIG terminals are assumed to be known. In the other
case wind speed (Vw), Q is assumed to be known. Apart from considering losses of the DFIG and GS ﬁlter, both the cases
also consider the non-unity power factor operation of the grid side converter (GSC). For the ﬁrst case, steady-state operating
conditions are calculated by iterative method as well as by non-iterative method. For the second case, iterative method is used
to calculate steady-state operating conditions. Calculation of steady-state values of other subsystems of DFIG-based WTS
like drive train, controller and network is also shown. The initial values calculated are validated and compared by performing
modal analysis and time-domain simulations."
62,Sieve Search Centroiding Algorithm for Star Sensors,"Abstract: The localization of the center of the star image formed on a sensor array directly affects
attitude estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an intuitive self-evolving centroiding algorithm,
termed the sieve search algorithm (SSA), which employs the structural properties of the point
spread function. This method maps the gray-scale distribution of the star image spot into a
matrix. This matrix is further segmented into contiguous sub-matrices, referred to as sieves.
Sieves comprise a finite number of pixels. These sieves are evaluated and ranked based on their
degree of symmetry and magnitude. Every pixel in the image spot carries the accumulated
score of the sieves associated with it, and the centroid is its weighted average. The performance
evaluation of this algorithm is carried out using star images of varied brightness, spread radius,
noise level, and centroid location. In addition, test cases are designed around particular scenarios,
like non-uniform point spread function, stuck-pixel noise, and optical double stars. The proposed
algorithm is compared with various long-standing and state-of-the-art centroiding algorithms.
The numerical simulation results validated the effectiveness of SSA, which is suitable for small
satellites with limited computational resources. The proposed algorithm is found to have precision
comparable with that of fitting algorithms. As for computational overhead, the algorithm requires
only basic math and simple matrix operations, resulting in a visible decrease in execution time.
These attributes make SSA a fair compromise between prevailing gray-scale and fitting algorithms
concerning precision, robustness, and processing time."

cation on the stability of a grid-integrated doubly fed induction
generator (DFIG) based wind energy conversion systems (WECS)

of grid-connected DFIG is also studied. The full order model of
DFIG is considered including the GSC controllers. The stability
study of a grid-interfaced DFIG-based WECS is performed
by modal analysis and time-domain simulations. The results
obtained by using lumped-mass model of drive train shows that
the results are over optimistic in stability view-point."
62,Switched Capacitor Based Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for Photovoltaic Energy Storage System in Indian Electricity Demand Scenario Utilizing Secondary Life of Electric Vehicle Battery,"Abstract— The fossil fuel depletion and surge in electricity 
demand have paved the way to intense penetration of renewable 
energy sources, especially Solar. The growth in photovoltaic 
system and its peak power generation from 11 am to 3 pm, when 
the electricity demand is low, requires energy storage system 
(ESS) for efficient utilization of photovoltaic power generation. In 
this paper, Photovoltaic Energy Storage System in the Indian 
scenario is developed by considering the charging of Electric 
Vehicle (EV) Battery and Auxiliary Battery (AB) during the peak 
power generation of solar photovoltaic (SPV) system interfacing 
with power electronic converters. In this proposed work, the 
Secondary Life of High-Capacity EV battery is utilized as AB. 
Switched Capacitor (SC) based bidirectional DC-DC converter is 
used to interface the DC link voltage of SPV to the charging of the 
EV and AB. The proposed methodology is validated with 
hardware setup of SPV system, SC-based power converter and 
18650 3000mAh Li-Ion cell used as EV and AB."

position of the yaw channel. The proposed control scheme
compensates for variations in hydrodynamic parameters, delays
in the measurement signals, small and high magnitude time-
varying disturbances acting on the yaw channel. The closed-loop

62,SoC Estimation and IoT based Delayed Charging of Electric Vehicles,"Abstract—The fossil fuel crisis and increased pollution by internal 
combustion engines have forced to bring back decade old Electric 
Vehicle (EV) technology. The heart of EV is its battery and its life 
management is having crucial role in the longevity of EV. The 
aging of EV batteries is unavoidable and care has to be taken to 
reduce the aging. One of the main reasons for aging is that EVs 
are left unused with high State of Charge (SoC) i.e., calendar 
aging. In this paper delayed charging technique is incorporated in-
order to reduce calendar ageing. The Internet of Things (IoT) 
technology is used to implement the delayed charging in this 
proposed framework. The combination of Open Circuit Voltage 
(OCV) and LTC2941 based Coulomb Counting method of SoC 
estimation is used here. The proposed methodology is validated 
with hardware setup and Blynk app-based results."
62,Yaw channel control of an autonomous underwater vehicle using sliding mode control based on an extended state observer,"Abstract—A highly uncertain and time-varying ocean envi-
ronment demands a robust control strategy to accomplish the
autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission. This paper ad-
dresses the sliding mode controller based on linear extended state
observer (SMC-LESO) control strategy on the linearized yaw
channel model of an experimental MAYA AUV. Trajectory
tracking control problem is chosen to control the yaw channel
of the vehicle in the presence of system non-linearity, modelling
uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances
treated as a total disturbance/uncertainty. LESO is designed to
estimate the total disturbance/uncertainty online along with the
system states. SMC is designed on the basis of the estimated value.
The proposed control scheme is robust against total disturbance,
and it tracks the desired trajectory effectively. The closed-loop
stability of the proposed controller is validated in the sense
of Lyapunov. The trajectory tracking performance is analyzed
against control objectives. Simulation studies have been carried
out to examine the efficacy and applicability of the proposed
control scheme."
62,An Accurate Method For Steady State Initialization of Doubly Fed Induction Generator,"Abstract—In this paper, an accurate method for calculation of
steady-state values of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)
is proposed. The assumption of active power (P) and reactive
power (Q) or terminal voltage (Vt) as constant variables at DFIG
bus may not yield accurate results as wind speed is variable in
nature. So, an initialization strategy considering input wind speed
(Vw) as known variable, is employed in the present work, which
is an accurate way to start with initialization. The approach
followed in this paper also considers grid side ﬁlter losses, and
non-zero reactive power ﬂow through grid side converter (GSC).
The steady-state values obtained from the approach followed in
this paper is dynamically tested on SMIB system by conducting
modal studies and time domain simulations."

For the subsequent implementation of the controller in practice, a method for reducing its order
based on the Hankel norm approximation is applied. The proposed approach is tested on the
mathematical model of the MAYA AUV with the parameters deviating from the nominal values.
The simulation result shows that the proposed robust control scheme effectively compensates
for the parametric uncertainty and underwater disturbances."

62,Disturbance Observer Based Sliding Mode Control for Lateral Motion of an AUV,"Abstract—A lateral motion control problem of an experi-
mental autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) MAYA AUV is
considered. In this paper, a disturbance observer based sliding
mode control (DOB-SMC) scheme is proposed in the presence
of parameter perturbation and disturbances. During motion,
a highly uncertain ocean environment demands robust control
to handle the parameter perturbations and disturbances. This
problem can be directly resolved by a sliding mode control
(SMC) design. The disturbance observer (DOB) is designed to
approximate the equivalent control of SMC containing distur-
bances. To restrain the chattering, DOB is designed such that the
disturbance estimation converges to disturbance exponentially
and feedback switching gain converges to zero exponentially.
The proposed control scheme is examined through a computa-
tional tool."

the measurement signal of pitch channel dynamics. The
proposed SMC based delayed output estimator tracks
the vehicle position under parametric variations and
time-varying disturbances. The closed-loop stability is
analysed. The observer error and tracking error asymp-
totic convergence is realized. Furthermore, controller
performance is demonstrated through simulation results
using MATLAB Simulink R2019b (9.7.0.1471314)."
62,A Direct Method for Calculation of Steady-state Operating Conditions of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator,"Abstract-Sharing reactive power burden between the rotor
side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) under normal
conditions reduces the burden on RSC and improves its life-
time expectancy. In this paper, a non-iterative or direct method
for calculation of steady-state operating points of a doubly fed
induction generator (DFIG), considering non-zero reactive power
flow through grid side of DFIG, is developed. The approach also
considers grid side filter losses. The direct initialization method is
applied on both subsynchronous and supersynchronous steady-
state models of DFIG. A comparison of initial values obtained at
various modes of operation of DFIG is conducted. The approach
helps in accurate initialization of DFIG in both subsynchronous
and supersynchronous modes. The non-iterative approach also
prevents non-convergence issues and significantly reduces the
calculation time of DFIG internal variables."
62,Steady-state Initialization of Doubly Fed Induction Generator Based Wind Turbine Considering Grid Side Filter,"Abstract—In this paper, a steady-state initialization method for
a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbines in-
cluding grid side (GS) ﬁlter equations is discussed. The approach
employed considers factors like non-zero grid side converter
(GSC) reactive power and GS ﬁlter losses. As per the recent
grid code requirements, DFIG should be able to participate in
reactive power support to maintain voltage stability during faults.
Also GSC acts as STATCOM by its structure and supports
in damping inter-area oscillations. Above conditions mandates
to consider the non-unity power factor operation of GSC. The
approach employed also considers GS ﬁlter losses, by which an
accurate initial values can be obtained. Dynamic evaluation of
the steady-state values obtained are performed using eigenvalues
and time-domain simulations. The studies are performed on a
single-machine-inﬁnite-bus (SMIB) system and the results are
compared with dynamic results with a case wherein GS currents
are considered as dummy states."

63,Modulation of radio frequency signal due to surface atmospheric parameters,"Abstract: The estimation of the electromagnetic signal power 
losses is a very important step in the design of radio systems. The 
main objective of this study is to find out the effect of Atmospheric 
variations on the RF transmission, as the signal propagate through 
the atmosphere. Two transceivers (Zigbees) at 2.4 GHz at known 
distance are used to measure the received signal strength (RSSI) 
and an autonomous weather station (AWS) measures the surface 
atmospheric parameters simultaneously. The hourly average 
variations in the relative humidity and the transmitted signal 
strength are closely observed to be inversely related. Attenuation 
correlation coefficient with the atmospheric parameters for the 
month of December 2014 and February 2015 is ~0.4 and 0.6 
respectively. Presented results of attenuation will be very useful for 
communication system design engineers in the regions of goa."
64,Fault Detection Based on Causal Discovery and Graph Convolutional Network for Complex Mechatronic Systems,"Abstract—Detecting precisely any incipient fault is of critical
importanceforamechatronicsystem,whichmayimproveitssafety,
availability, and maintainability. However, high dimensionality and
data imbalance are big obstacles for establishing an effective fault
detection model. In this article, an interpretable fault detection
model is proposed by designing a causal-based graph convolution
network (GCN). First, the biased data distribution of imbalanced
monitoring data is adjusted according to prior knowledge, to
obtain a more trustable causal network. Second, average causal
effects (ACEs) are calculated according to the obtained causal
network to quantitatively describe the causal relations. Finally,
a directed weighted GCN (DWGCN) is designed for the causal
network with ACEs to build the fault detection model. Spectral
clustering and graph coarsening methods for directed graphs are
integrated in DWGCN. And, to improve the modeling efﬁciency,
the model structure parameters are carefully designed. Based on
bothsimulationdataandrealdata,theproposedpriori-constrained
causal discovery has been proven to be able to mine causal networks
that meet more than 50% of prior-constraints. And, based on real
data, the average F-measure and G-mean of the DWGCN reach
84.7% and 85.3%, which is superior to the conventional GCNs and
machine learning methods."

aiming at improving performance, robustness, and in-
terpretability of classical principle component analysis
(PCA) methods. First, the causal discovery algorithms are
adopted to construct the corresponding causal network
among monitoring variables. Then, two causality-based
PCA methods are proposed, based on the corresponding
qualitative reachability matrix and quantitative reachabil-
ity strength matrix, respectively. Average treatment effect
values are considered as the quantitative measure of the
causalities in a reachability strength matrix. The robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed methods are veriﬁed on
a synthetic dataset and four public datasets in comparison
with two benchmark methods, i.e., PCA and autoencoder.
The proposed methods are also adopted in a high-speed
train braking system for extracting informative features
from the monitoring variables."
64,Resilience Assessment of Beijing Subway Lines under Extreme Precipitation Weather,"Abstract: Trafﬁc infrastructure safety is a core topic in trafﬁc construction and development. As the
impact of global climate change becomes more and more signiﬁcant, extreme weather brings more
and more safety issues to the normal operation of subway systems. Therefore, it is an urgent issue
in the construction of subway systems to fully prepare for extreme weather and improve system
resilience under external disturbances. The resilience of a complex system generally refers to its ability
to adapt to external disturbances and return to a functional state. As one of several key infrastructure
systems in large cities, a subway system needs to be highly resilient to cope with various risks,
and it needs to recover quickly under uncertain weather conditions and other external damage
events. In order to achieve the goal of conducting a real-time resilience assessment of a subway
system, this study adopts the Bayesian network and the traditional failure mode and effect analysis
(FMEA) method to realize resilience assessment with multiple performance indicators. Combined
with the risk matrix method from FMEA, multiple important indicators of a subway system under
the inﬂuence of extreme weather are obtained. These important indicators are integrated into the
resilience assessment of the subway system within a Bayesian method. In this paper, the feasibility
and applicability of the proposed method are veriﬁed by taking the Changping Line of the Beijing
subway under extreme rainfall weather (>10 mm) as a case."
64,Evaluation of Educational Interventions Based on Average Treatment Effect: A Case Study,"Abstract: Relative to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with privacy and ethical concerns, observa-
tional studies are becoming dominant in education research. In an observational study, it is necessary
and important to correctly evaluate the effects of different interventions (i.e., covariates) on student
performance with observational data. However, these effects’ evaluation results are probably derived
from biased estimations because the distributions of “control” and “treatment” student groups can
hardly be equivalent to those in RCTs. Moreover, the collected covariates on possible educational
interventions (i.e., treatments) may be confounded with student characteristics that are not included
in the data. In this work, an estimation method based on the Rubin causal model (RCM) is proposed
to calculate the average treatment effect (ATE) of different educational interventions. Speciﬁcally,
with the selected covariates, the propensity score (i.e., the probability of treatment exposure condi-
tional on covariates) is considered as a criterion to stratify the observational data into sub-classes
with balanced covariate distributions between the control and treatment groups. Combined with
Neyman’s estimation, the ATE of each sample is then obtained. We verify the effectiveness of this
method with real observational data on student performance and its covariates."
64,T-Friedman Test: A New Statistical Test for Multiple Comparison with an Adjustable Conservativeness Measure,"Abstract
To prove that a certain algorithm is superior to the benchmark algorithms, the statistical hypothesis tests are commonly 
adopted with experimental results on a number of datasets. Some statistical hypothesis tests draw statistical test results 
more conservative than the others, while it is not yet possible to characterize quantitatively the degree of conservativeness 
of such a statistical test. On the basis of the existing nonparametric statistical tests, this paper proposes a new statistical test 
for multiple comparison which is named as t-Friedman test. T-Friedman test combines t test with Friedman test for multiple 
comparison. The confidence level of the t test is adopted as a measure of conservativeness of the proposed t-Friedman test. 
A bigger confidence level infers a higher degree of conservativeness, and vice versa. Based on the synthetic results generated 
by Monte Carlo simulations with predefined distributions, the performance of several state-of-the-art multiple comparison 
tests and post hoc procedures are first qualitatively analyzed. The influences of the type of predefined distribution, the num-
ber of benchmark algorithms and the number of datasets are explored in the experiments. The conservativeness measure of 
the proposed method is also validated and verified in the experiments. Finally, some suggestions for the application of these 
nonparametric statistical tests are provided."
64,jdmd.2022.68 84..92,"Abstract: Data-driven methods are widely considered for fault diagnosis in complex systems. However, in
practice, the between-class imbalance due to limited faulty samples may deteriorate their classiﬁcation perfor-
mance. To address this issue, synthetic minority methods for enhancing data have been proved to be effective in
many applications. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), capable of automatic features extraction, can also be
adopted for augmenting the faulty samples. However, the monitoring data of a complex system may include not
only continuous signals but also discrete/categorical signals. Since the current GAN methods still have some
challenges in handling such heterogeneous monitoring data, a Mixed Dual Discriminator GAN (noted as M-
D2GAN) is proposed in this work. In order to render the expanded fault samples more aligned with the real
situation and improve the accuracy and robustness of the fault diagnosis model, different types of variables are
generated in different ways, including ﬂoating-point, integer, categorical, and hierarchical. For effectively
considering the class imbalance problem, proper modiﬁcations are made to the GAN model, where a normal
class discriminator is added. A practical case study concerning the braking system of a high-speed train is carried
out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared to the classic GAN, the proposed framework
achieves better results with respect to F-measure and G-mean metrics.

64,Importance-SMOTE: a synthetic minority oversampling method for noisy imbalanced data,"Abstract
Synthetic minority oversampling methods have been proven to be an efﬁcient solution for tackling imbalanced data
classiﬁcation issues. Different strategies have been proposed for generating synthetic minority samples. However, noisy
samples which may cause the overlapping of minority and majority classes have not yet been properly treated for reducing
their inﬂuence on the performance of a classiﬁcation model. A new method, named Importance-SMOTE, is proposed in
this paper. In this method, only borderline and edge samples in minority class are oversampled. The synthetic minority
samples are generated proportionally to the importance of the minority samples which is calculated according to the
composition and distribution of its nearest neighbors. The positions of the synthetic minority samples are determined by the
relative importance of the paired neighbors. The proposed method is expected to obtain a more precise estimation of the
true decision surface and reduce the inﬂuence of noisy samples. Various public imbalanced datasets and a real case study
are considered in the experiments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method."

64,Microsoft Word - AZQINREHNH,"Abstract. Loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) of reactor coolant pump is considered as a critical 
issue in pressurized water reactor (PWR) accident analysis. Much work focus on the detection 
of LOCA, while little work has been done on leakage quantity estimation. In this paper, a 
reactor coolant leakage estimation model is proposed based on broad learning system (BLS) 
model which takes the advantages of the flatted structure and incremental learning. 
Considering that larger leakage is more concerned, the BLS model is improved by a weighted 
loss function. Dropout layer and white noise are added to improve the robustness of the model. 
This model is designed to estimate the coolant leakage in an online manner with high precision. 
The proposed model is evaluated on real leakage data of a reactor coolant pump. Experiments 
show that, with similar accuracy, the proposed model is significantly faster than the state-of-art 
deep neural networks."
64,An Efficient Anomaly Detection for High-Speed Train Braking System Using Broad Learning System,"ABSTRACT
For a high-speed train, the braking system plays an essential role in safe transportation.
Efﬁcient state monitoring and anomaly detection may provide useful information for real-time decisions.
With large amount of monitoring data, data-driven methods, especially deep learning methods are widely
adopted for anomaly detection in various industrial applications. Although deep learning methods have
advantages in discovering non-linear relations among complex and high-dimensional data, the large amount
of hyperparameters can be hardly well tuned with a high computational burden for onboard computers.
Therefore, in this work an efﬁcient online anomaly detection model based on Broad Learning System (BLS)
is established for detecting anomalies in the braking system. Furthermore, considering the intrinsic imbal-
anced data size on anomaly and normal states, the cost-sensitive learning method is integrated in the BLS
model, for the ﬁrst time. The proposed model is evaluated on real data collected from a high-speed train
operating for one year, with respect to two performance metrics, i.e. G-mean and F1-score. Comparisons
with benchmark neural networks and the combinations of sampling methods and BLS are also considered
in this work."
64,Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on the Coherent Demodulation Model,"ABSTRACT The rolling bearing is an important part of rotary machineries and the health state monitoring
is currently a hot research topic. There are four typical failure modes of a rolling bearing: the inner race
failure, the outer race failure, the rolling element failure and the support frame failure. Based on the
principle of the coherent demodulation, a new method for rolling bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in
this work. This method establishes a coherent demodulator simulation model which is usually adopted
in the ﬁeld of radio communications. The proposed method ﬁrst demodulates the vibration signal with
coherent demodulation principle. Then, the characteristic frequencies related the different failures modes
are extracted to obtain the fault characteristic amplitudes, to diagnose the ongoing failure mode. The bearing
fault data from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Test Center is taken as an example to verify and
analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that this method can accurately diagnose
the corresponding failure mode with different locations and sizes."

65,On Demand Reliability in the Internet of Things Enabled Sensors Networks,"Abstract—Internet of Things (IoT) employs pervasive inte-
gration of sensors-equipped entities, such as devices, vehicles,
and home appliances. These entities collect and exchange data
using application-specific software and require seamless net-
work connectivity. The seamless communication between IoT
devices enables remote monitoring and control via the Internet.
However, the reliability of communication comes at the cost of
device and network resources, adding strain to the resource-
constrained IoT environment. In this paper, we propose a novel
and efficient approach to attain user-specified reliability in IoT-
enabled sensor networks. Apart from being statically confined
to a single communication protocol, the approach dynamically
selects between the transmission control-based Message Queuing
Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and user datagram-based MQTT
protocols. This ensures optimal resource utilisation of the IoT
devices and communication networks. The approach considers
the reliability fraction as the input from the users and accesses the
IoT device and network resources, including processing power,
memory, and network speed to choose the optimal protocol
for transmitting the data in the network. Furthermore, we
employ the long short-term memory on the time series data of
IoT device resources to decide the most suitable protocol for
data transmission. The decision serves as feedback to users for
reevaluating their reliability requirements. Through experimental
evaluation, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of resource efficiency and communication time with the given
reliability."
65,A Federated Learning Approach to Minimize Communication Rounds Using Noise Rectification,"Abstract—Federated learning is a distributed training frame-
work that ensures data privacy and reduces communication
overhead to train a shared model among multiple participants.
Noise in the datasets and communication channels diminishes
performance and increases communication rounds for conver-
gence. This paper proposes a federated learning approach to
rectify noise in local datasets and communication channels for
reducing communication rounds. We employ two ﬁlters: one to
rectify noise in the dataset and the other for the communication
channel. We also consider two types of participants: one uses a
ﬁlter on the dataset, and the other uses both the dataset and
the communication channel. We ﬁrst derive the expression to
estimate the communication rounds for convergence. Next, we
determine the number of participants under each type. Finally,

65,Fed-RAC: Resource-Aware Clustering for Tackling Heterogeneity of Participants in Federated Learning,"Abstract—Federated Learning is a training framework that
enables multiple participants to collaboratively train a shared
model while preserving data privacy. The heterogeneity of devices
and networking resources of the participants delay the training
and aggregation. The paper introduces a novel approach to fed-
erated learning by incorporating resource-aware clustering. This
method addresses the challenges posed by the diverse devices and
networking resources among participants. Unlike static clustering
approaches, this paper proposes a dynamic method to determine
the optimal number of clusters using Dunn Indices. It enables
adaptabilitytothevaryingheterogeneitylevelsamongparticipants,
ensuring a responsive and customized approach to clustering. Next,
the paper goes beyond empirical observations by providing a math-

a leader-follower technique, particularly through knowledge dis-
tillation, which improves the performance of lightweight models
within clusters. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate
the approach and to compare it with state-of-the-art. The results
demonstrated an accuracy improvement of over 3% compared to
its closest competitor and a reduction in communication rounds of

65,1,"Abstract—In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged
as a promising technique for training machine learning models in
a decentralized manner while also preserving data privacy. The
non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) nature of
client data, coupled with constraints on client or edge devices,
presents significant challenges in FL. Furthermore, learning
across a high number of communication rounds can be risky
and potentially unsafe for model exploitation. Traditional FL
approaches may suffer from these challenges. Therefore, we
introduce FedSiKD, which incorporates knowledge distillation
(KD) within a similarity-based federated learning framework.
As clients join the system, they securely share relevant statistics
about their data distribution, promoting intra-cluster homo-
geneity. This enhances optimization efficiency and accelerates
the learning process, effectively transferring knowledge between
teacher and student models and addressing device constraints.
FedSiKD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving
higher accuracy, exceeding by 25% and 18% for highly skewed
data at α = 0.1, 0.5 on the HAR and MNIST datasets, respec-
tively. Its faster convergence is illustrated by a 17% and 20%
increase in accuracy within the first five rounds on the HAR and
MNIST datasets, respectively, highlighting its early-stage learning
proficiency. Code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub 1"
65,Minimizing Intra-Interference in LoRaWAN for Seamless Connectivity in Ubiquitous Networking,"Abstract—Ubiquitous networking is rapidly gaining predomi-
nance in various domains from predictive maintenance to cor-
rective updates, enabling seamless connectivity for a wide range
of devices and applications. Long Range Wide Area Network
(LoRaWAN) provides a low power and long range of connectivity,
which accelerates the growth of ubiquitous networking. However,
with this growth, the number of devices and deployments rises,
consequently increasing the likelihood of communication channel
interference. Prior studies have mostly emphasized the criticality
of inter-interference, while intra-interference is less explored.
Moreover, in the case of ubiquitous and sensor networks handling
intra-interference is crucial, as it can degrade the quality of
service and disrupt connectivity within the constrained infras-
tructure. This paper proposes a novel approach to minimize
intra-interference in LoRaWAN networks to enable seamless
connectivity despite limited resources in ubiquitous network-
ing. The approach leverages the concept of collision avoidance
techniques in the hashing table to optimize the communication
channel allocation for reducing collisions caused due to intra-
interference. The approach employs the division-based method
for generating hash codes and tackles collision using a chaining
scheme. We present a detailed experimental evaluation with real-
world prototype deployment to analyze the impact of intra-
interference and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

65,Machine Learning-Based Interference Mitigation in Long-Range Networks for High-Ceiling Smart Buildings,"ABSTRACT Long-Range networks are increasingly used in smart spaces due to their ability to provide
longer communication range while consuming low energy. To facilitate communication among different
Long-Range nodes, a gateway is used. For instance, in smart buildings such as airports, railway stations,
indoor stadiums, and auditoriums, sensory data from multiple sites are transferred to a base station through
a Long-Range gateway. However, when multiple nodes transmit data simultaneously to the gateway,
it generates network interference, especially in high-ceiling smart buildings where Long-Range nodes
with sensors are attached to monitor the building’s health. In this paper, we present a new method for
identifying interfering Long-Range Nodes (LNs) in high-ceiling smart buildings using a classification
model. Our approach involves gathering and analyzing network parameters, such as signal-to-noise ratio and
received signal strength indicator, from the signals to extract features that the classifier uses for interference
classification. The approach categorizes interference based on the number of interfering LNs, with each class
representing a distinct number of interfering LNs. We also introduce a push-based mechanism to detect and
adjust the power levels of faulty LNs, reducing interference. Our method is cost-effective as it is hardware-
independent, making it feasible to implement on the LG platform. Finally, we present a dataset of network
interference generated by varying the number of nodes, obstacles, and other parameters. We train the model
on the generated dataset and evaluate its effectiveness using a test bed. The experimental results demonstrate
that the approach can successfully identify interference nodes in a complex network."

DNN on edge devices becomes prohibitive due to the colossal com-
putation, energy, and storage requirements. This paper presents a
novel approach, EarlyLight, for designing and training lightweight
DNN using large-size DNN. The approach considers the available
storage, processing speed, and maximum allowable processing time
to execute the task on edge devices. We present a knowledge dis-
tillation based training procedure to train the lightweight DNN
to achieve adequate accuracy. During the training of lightweight
DNN, we introduce a novel early halting technique, which preserves
network resources; thus, speedups the training procedure. Finally,
we present the empirically and real-world evaluations to verify the

65,A Federated Learning Approach With Imperfect Labels in LoRa-Based Transportation Systems,"Abstract— Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) helps to
improve vehicle health, driver safety, and passenger comfort.
Remotely sharing the information of ITS to train the machine
and deep learning models hamper data privacy and generate
security threats to the passenger, driver, and vehicle owners.
Moreover, sharing the information requires huge networking
resources such as high data rate, low latency, and low packet loss.
Federated learning provides privacy-preserving model training
on the vehicle without sharing the information. However, due
to poor annotation mechanisms, federated learning may suffer
from imperfect labels. This paper proposes a federated learning
approach for ITS that can handle imperfect labels in the datasets
of the participants. The approach also uses a Long-Range
network to provide communication efficient connectivity. The
approach initially estimates class-wise centroids of the datasets
at the participants and server and then identifies participants
with imperfect labels using similarity scores. Such participants
demand the fraction of the correctly annotated dataset at the
server to improve performance. We further derive the expression
for the optimal fraction of the dataset requested by a participant.
We finally verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach using
the existing model and publicly available dataset."

including agriculture, education, healthcare, passenger assistance, transportation, and tourism,
among others [2, 3]. The machine learning based approaches require handcrafted features, which
reduce their suitability for a new dataset, where information about data distribution is missing [4].
Therefore, Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based IoT applications have achieved dominance in the
past decade [5–10]. This is because the DNN provides automatic feature extraction capability from
a large amount of raw sensory data. A DNN not only eliminates the human intervention for cal-
culating domain-related features but also achieves coercive performance [5]. A DNN involves the
following components, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Fully Connected
(FC) layers, and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A DNN can have all of these components
at a time or any of its combinations. The CNN extracts spatial features, and the RNN identifies tem-
poral features from the dataset. These features achieve high-order performance in classification,
regression, and prediction [11–13].
Despite these advantages, the DNN requires a significant amount of resources, including energy,
processing capacity, and storage. This resource requirement reduces the suitability of a DNN for
Resource-Constrained Devices (RCDs) in IoT [14, 15]. The huge resource requirements of the
DNN also become a bottleneck for real-time inference on RCDs and browser-based applications.
Therefore, to mitigate these shortcomings of DNNs (i.e., energy, processing capacity, and storage),
different DNN compression techniques have been proposed in the existing literature [16–32]. We
can achieve several benefits by compressing the DNN over the traditional cumbersome DNN:
• Storage capacity: A DNN achieves significant accuracy that comes up with a large number
of parameters, requiring considerable storage [33, 34]. Therefore, by compressing the DNN,
we can preserve storage that facilitates the deployment of the DNN on RCDs.
• Computation requirements: A large number of FLoating point OPerations (FLOPs) in-
volved in the DNN operation can exceed the limited computational capacity of the RCDs [35].
Thus, it would be beneficial to employ DNN compression for reducing the computation
requirement.
• Earliness: The training and inference time of a DNN is significantly high, which hampers its
real-time inference performance [36, 37]. Therefore, DNN compression mechanisms provide
a higher degree of earliness in both training and inference phases.
• Privacy: The data transmission from the source to the high-end machine leads to security
breach and privacy compromise [38]. Thus, it would be beneficial to employ in situ process-
ing using a compressed DNN on RCDs, which helps in preserving privacy and data security.
The demand for IoT-based applications is growing day by day, encouraging data scientists to
incorporate DNNs in IoT applications. Therefore, it is beneficial to provide a thorough overview
of the DNN compression technique that can meet the limited storage and processing capacity
available at the resource-constrained IoT devices. Thus far, efforts have been made in the existing
literature to provide the surveys on DNN compression techniques [39–41]. For example, Cheng
et al. [39] have covered the overview of DNN compression techniques, including parameters prun-
ing and quantization, low-rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. However, the authors
missed some crucial DNN compression techniques, such as layer pruning, weight sharing, estima-
tion using integer, teaching assistant, and domain adaptation in knowledge distillation.
Furthermore, Nan et al. [41] surveyed the layer compression techniques for DNNs, including
weight factorization and pruning, convolutional decomposition, and unique layer design. However,
the survey has covered the shortcomings of including layer compression but cannot summarize
the vital technique of knowledge distillation for improving the performance of compressed DNNs.
Similarly, Deng et al. [40] covered the DNN compression techniques emphasizing on co-designing
of the hardware and algorithm. Here, the authors surveyed hardware-specific compression for

achieving an optimal lightweight DNN. The survey only covers algorithmic compression such as
tensor decomposition, data quantization, and sparsification.
Thus, we carry out a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on different DNN compres-
sion techniques and propose a helpful categorization to point out a potential research gap for future
work. Apart from the existing surveys, we summarize all of the novel approaches in the literature
on DNN compression such that the reader can get the overview from a single source. In addition,
we try to mitigate all of the shortcomings of the existing surveys on DNN compression techniques
such that researchers could benefit when developing lightweight DNNs for limited-resource IoT
devices.
The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the categorization of DNN
compression. Section 3 presents an overview of network pruning. The sparse representation tech-
niques are presented in Section 4. Further, Sections 5 and 6 demonstrate the detailed description
of bits precision and knowledge distillation techniques, respectively. Miscellaneous techniques are
discussed in Section 7. Section 8 illustrates different applications of IoT using compressed DNNs.
Finally, Section 9 presents discussions and future directions.

CATEGORIZATION OF DNN COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES FOR IOT
The existing work [16–32] on DNN-based recognition using sensory data adopts different mech-
anisms to enhance the deployment of DNNs on RCDs. These mechanisms not only preserve data
privacy due to local computation but also decrease the energy consumption during computation.
We categorize the existing work on DNN compression into five broad categories—network prun-
ing, sparse representation, bits precision, knowledge distillation, and miscellaneous techniques—
for DNN compression. These categories were chosen through an extensive literature review on
sensory data based DNN compression techniques. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the existing
work under different categories of DNN compression for IoT.
2.1
Network Pruning
Deep network pruning is one of the popular techniques to reduce the size of a deep learning model
by incorporating the removal of the inadequate components such as channels, filters, neurons, or
layers to produce a lightweight DNN [42, 43]. The resultant lightweight DNN has low power con-
sumption, is memory efficient, and provides faster inference with minimal accuracy compromise.
The adequacy of a component relies on the amount of loss incurred when a component is removed
from the DNN [31, 44]. We further categorized the network pruning techniques into four parts:
channel pruning, filter pruning, connection pruning, and layer pruning. An overview of existing
network pruning techniques [16, 31, 45–64] is presented in Section 3.
2.2
Sparse Representation
Sparse representation exploits the sparsity present in the weight matrices of the DNN [65]. In
sparse representation, the weights that are zero or near to zero are removed from the weight
matrix, which reduces the storage and computation requirements of the DNN. In other words,
those links in the network having similar weights are multiplexed, where multiple weights with
a single link is replaced with a single weight with the multiplex link. The sparse representation
includes low-rank estimates [66] and multiplexing, among others. The principal motive behind
the sparse representation is to minimise the number of bits required to store weight matrix in
memory without loosing the performance. In this work, we divide the DNN compression using
sparse representation into two subcategories: multiplexing, and weight sharing. Section 4 presents
a detailed description of the sparse representation techniques in the literature [17, 18, 56, 62, 67–70]
on DNN compression.

65,A Federated Learning-Based Patient Monitoring System in Internet of Medical Things,"Abstract—Patient activities’ monitoring is a promising appli-
cation of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), revolutionizing
clinical diagnosis. An IoMT uses sensory data collected from
smart devices to train a model on the server. The trained
model recognizes the patient activities on smart devices. However,
training the model on the server has raised privacy concerns and
security threats. The sensitive medical data transferred from
the smart devices to the Cloud poses different cybersecurity
challenges, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing,
network penetration, and side-channel. This article proposes a
secure patient monitoring system using federated learning (FL).
The system performs training on local devices and sends only
weight matrices to the server for aggregation; thus, it preserves
data privacy and security compromises. The system intelligently
divides the participants into clusters based on the available
resources, trains suitable models on each cluster, and enhances
the performance via knowledge distillation (KD). The model of
high-performing clusters distills knowledge to the model of small-
size clusters to improve their performance. The experimental
results illustrate that the proposed system successfully work in
the presence of unequal resources."
65,1.tex,"ABSTRACT
Smart sensing provides an easier and convenient data-driven mech-
anism for monitoring and control in the built environment. Data
generated in the built environment are privacy sensitive and lim-
ited. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm that provides
privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple participants for
model training without sharing private and limited data. The noisy
labels in the datasets of the participants degrade the performance
and increase the number of communication rounds for convergence
of federated learning. Such large communication rounds require
more time and energy to train the model. In this paper, we propose
a federated learning approach to suppress the unequal distribution
of the noisy labels in the dataset of each participant. The approach
ﬁrst estimates the noise ratio of the dataset for each participant and
normalizes the noise ratio using the server dataset. The proposed
approach can handle bias in the server dataset and minimizes its
impact on the participants’ dataset. Next, we calculate the optimal
weighted contributions of the participants using the normalized
noise ratio and inﬂuence of each participant. We further derive
the expression to estimate the number of communication rounds
required for the convergence of the proposed approach. Finally, ex-
perimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed
approach over existing techniques in terms of the communication
rounds and achieved performance in the built environment.

Challenges and tsolutions of using IoD in 
agriculture
This section covers inherent challenges and corresponding solu-
tions in IoD for precision agriculture. It highlights the appro-
priate mechanisms that unleash the potential of IoD using 
non-line-of-sight and autonomous operations. We also figure 
out the suitability of IoD in terms of communication, cost, secu-
rity, resources, precision, safety, and sustainability. Figure 2 
illustrates the taxonomy of different challenges and solutions of 
using IoD in precision agriculture.
Communication among Drones
IoD offers automated operation of multiple drones for mon-
itoring and analyzing the current status of agricultural fields. 
The drones possess inherent mobility and thus require wireless 
connectivity for communication [6]. A simple mechanism is to 
exploit the existing cellular network to facilitate communication 
with drones in IoD. We can use the cellular connection for 
simultaneously operating the drones and fetching the informa-
tion from the farmland. However, the existing wireless commu-
nication techniques are optimized for terrestrial devices with 
down-tilted antennas of base stations.
Moreover, base stations are often overloaded with data 
transmission to/from terrestrial devices. Thus, connecting a 
large number of drones with cellular towers is tedious. Addition-
ally, it becomes cost-inefficient to enable cellular connectivity in 
each drone. Furthermore, cellular connection does not guaran-
tee collision avoidance among drones while operating in non-
line-of-sight above agricultural fields in remote areas.
Inter-drone communication can be a key enabler to miti-
gate the aforementioned issues. Multiple drones flying above 
farmland establish an aerial interconnected network using com-
munication techniques (BLE, WiFi, LoRaWAN, etc.). Further, to 
propagate data/results to the base station, only a few drones 
are connected to the ground station via the cellular network. 
These drones are the leader nodes with colossal battery power 
and support cellular connectivity. The formed aerial network 
proves its cost efficiency by involving both non-cellular-enabled 
(cheaper) and cellular-enabled (costlier) drones. It also provides 
collision avoidance and preserves energy with a higher likeli-
hood of line-of-sight communication among drones due to the 
obstacle-free sky. The likelihood of line-of-sight communication 
implies that drones are operating above ground, and they are in 
straight lines for easier communication. 
Communication to the Ground Station
IoD for precision agriculture demands reliable and flexible com-
munication channels among drones and ground stations to 
facilitate low latency and high bandwidth connectivity. Further, 
wide area network connectivity between drones and ground 
stations is a prerequisite for the successful operation of drones 
above farmland. Network availability also plays a crucial role 
to unlock the existing potential of IoD in precision agriculture. 
Therefore, it is necessary to harness mobile connectivity to 
ensure real-time data transmission while maintaining communi-
cation similar to terrestrial devices.
The cellular network facilitates various features that best 
suit the drone-to-ground station connectivity requirements, 
including reliability, flexibility, low latency, high bandwidth, 
and high availability [7]. Thus, the cellular network requires 
some optimizations to ensure real-time monitoring via IoD 
without hampering communication performance among ter-
restrial devices. 4G LTE, 5G, and upcoming 6G networks can 
be successfully incorporated in drone-to-ground station com-
munication. It ensures reliable operations and real-time mon-
itoring of the farmland with high quality of service in IoD. 
Further, drone-to-ground station connectivity is served by the 
sides lobes attached with the down-titled antenna of cellular 
base stations.
Installation and Maintenance Cost
The cost of installation and maintenance plays a vital role in 
determining the acceptability and success of modern inven-
tions. IoD requires a dedicated communication channel and 
autonomous monitoring of the farmland. IoD also demands 
specific hardware and software components to ensure real-
time monitoring and control. For example, drones in IoD 
require specialized hardware to support cellular connectivity, 
high battery power for long time operations, and adequate 
storage to capture sufficient data. All these requirements sum 
up to the high installation cost of IoD in agriculture. Thus, it 
becomes unaffordable for financially weak farmers to adopt 
IoD in agriculture. Moreover, the operation of drones in IoD 
requires human expertise, which again imposes a financial bur-
den on the farmers.
To resolve the issues mentioned above, IoD operators 
can utilize the interconnected drones comprising low-cost 
(non-cellular-enabled) and high-cost (cellular-enabled) drones 
to preserve the operational and maintenance cost. Such an IoD 
solution reduces the cost and makes them cheaper for farmers.
Cybersecurity and Privacy
IoD involves existing network connectivity to facilitate non-
line-of-sight and autonomous control over drones monitoring 
the agricultural field. Thus, the data collection, processing, and 
transmission in IoD are vulnerable to security and privacy risks. 
Different entities of IoD, including drones, ground stations, 
farmers’ smart devices, and so on, can intrude for payload data 
theft. IoD may suffer from different attacks, including localiza-
tion error attacks and attacks on privacy [8]. The localization 
attack can deteriorate the accurate positioning of the flying 
drones over the agricultural field. Therefore, the farmer may 
be misguided about the actual condition of the farm using IoD, 
which results in poor quality and quantity of production. Addi-

66,"Forming Process, Microstructure, and Mechanical Properties of Thin-Walled 316L Stainless Steel Using Speed-Cold-Welding Additive Manufacturing","Abstract: Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) produces thin-walled parts superior to other
additive manufacturing methods, because of its high efﬁciency, good compactability, and low cost.
However, the WAAM accuracy is limited by its large heat input. Here, 0.8 mm 316L stainless steel
welding wire is deposited via speed cold welding to form 30-layered thin-walled samples, with 2 mm
thickness, and up to 65 mm height. The effects of three process parameters (the bottom current
mode, scanning speed, and cooling time) on the deposition process stability, macro morphology,
structure, and mechanical properties are studied. In the experiment, the probability density curves of
electrical parameters of sample #GRBC-30 cm/min-10 s on the third and tenth layers were narrower
than other samples, which implied a more stable process. The three process parameters mainly
affect the deposition morphology and have a minor performance effect. The hardness and tensile
properties mainly depend on the deposition direction. Gradual, layer-by-layer current reduction
improves the bottom molding and performance, and the deposition efﬁciency, and stabilizes the
process. Scanning speed enhancement or cooling time reduction destabilizes the end formation,
reduces the effective deposition rate, and slightly degrades the performance. All deposited samples
are distinctly anisotropic, but satisfy the industrial standard. Overall, deposition in speed cold
welding mode, with 10 s cooling time, 30 cm/min scanning speed, and gradually reduced bottom
current exhibits good stability, and the molding efﬁciency and mechanical properties are optimal."
66,Influence of Heat Flow on the Grain Morphology and Porosity of Wire Arc Additive Manufactured 2319 Aluminum Alloy,"Abstract
Uniform grain morphology and low porosity are the key to obtain better mechanical properties of 2319 aluminum alloy 
fabricated by wire arc additive manufacture. In this study, the influence of heat flow on the grain morphology and porosity 
was investigated by experimental and simulation methods. The solidification theory was used to illustrate the columnar-
to-equiaxed transition phenomenon and the variation in the volume fractions of different grains. The results show that the 
deposition layer was composed of fine equiaxed grains in the inter-layer zone, columnar and equiaxed grains in the lower 
and upper parts the of inner-layer zone, respectively. Furthermore, the volume fractions of the equiaxed and columnar grains 
were varied by adjusting wire feed rates (WFR). With the higher WFR, the volume fraction of columnar grains decreases, 
while the porosity and tensile strength first increase and then decrease. The best mechanical properties could be achieved 
when the WFR was 5.5 m/min, with a tensile strength of 274 MPa and an elongation of 12.5%."
66,Numerical simulation of gravity effects on keyhole behaviors in laser mirror welding of 2219 aluminum alloy,"Abstract
Due to the mirror image symmetry of laser mirror welding heat sources, the post-weld deformation is observably lower than 
that of conventional welding methods. However, the mechanism of gravitational effects on the coupled keyhole molten pool 
at different welding positions is still unclear, which results in the tough control of welding defects, hindering the application 
of laser mirror welding in precision manufacturing of aerospace structural parts. In this study, the gravity effects on keyhole 
behaviors in laser mirror welding of 2219 aluminum alloy were investigated by establishing a computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) model. The keyhole morphology, coupling characteristics, and its dynamic evolution as well as force conditions were 
analyzed at length by employing the calibrated model. The results showed that gravity prominently affects the fluid veloc-
ity in the molten pool, which determines the keyhole characteristics. The keyhole surface flow, which enlarges the keyhole 
diameter, is impeded by gravity, resulting in weak keyhole coupling. The keyhole area on the weld cross-section before 
coupling is less than 2 ­mm2 and is negatively correlated with the gravitational component on this section. The keyhole area 
after coupling is tightly relevant to the keyhole diameter. The increase or decrease in the keyhole diameter is contingent on 
the resultant direction of gravity, fluid pressure, and vapor recoil pressure. Additionally, the keyhole coupling and dynamic 
behaviors in the welding direction are primarily affected by the surface tension gradient, while slightly affected by gravity."
66,Thermal-fluid dynamic behavior and its effect on particle distribution and solidification characterization during the laser melting deposition of Ti-based composites,"Abstract
Laser melting deposition (LMD) is an advanced repairing and remanufacturing technology that involves complex thermo-
dynamic and kinetic characteristics in a molten pool. A thorough understanding of the thermal-fluid dynamic behavior of 
molten metal is crucial for investigating the distribution of reinforced particles and the characterization of solidification. This 
study proposes a three-dimensional transient thermal-fluid coupling model for describing thermal-fluid dynamic behavior 
and particle migration behavior within a molten pool during LMD. The simulated morphology of the deposition layer and 
temperature agree well with the experiments. The simulation results indicate that Marangoni convection induced by tempera-
ture gradient dominates the convection mode. The fluid velocity distribution along the scanning direction of the molten metal 
is showing M shape. Meanwhile, the dimension of molten pool increases slightly, and the Marangoni convection becomes 
more vigorous with higher heat input. The Marangoni motion tends to drive the TiC particle migration from the center to 
both lateral sides, resulting in a more uniformly distributed of TiC particle in deposition layer. Furthermore, the solidification 
parameters at solid–liquid interface are calculated, which used to assess the solidification microstructure in deposition layer."
66,Evolution of Microstructure and Mechanical Property of Wire Arc Additive Manufactured Al–Cu Metallic Component after Simulated Thermal Service,"Abstract
Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has advantages such as high manufacturing flexibility and efficiency, making it 
feasible to fabricate large-scale aircraft components. Additive manufactured aircraft component suffers thermal processes 
during manufacturing and high-speed flight, affecting their microstructure, mechanical property, and lifetime. As-built 
microstructure and residual stress of the WAAM component and its evolution during thermal service are essential but nearly 
absent from the literature. This paper studies the evolution characteristic of microstructure, temperature field, stress distribu-
tion, and mechanical properties of 2319 aluminum alloy during the WAAM process and simulated high-speed flight. Results 
indicate that equiaxed grains and dendrite size in the top region increase slightly after thermal service, the grain distribution 
becomes more uniform, and the boundary between layers is far less evident than the as-built state. After thermal service, the 
WAAM component inherits the as-built mechanical properties. The lower wire feeding rate and the higher scanning speed 
can significantly reduce the maximum stress value of the WAAM component and change the stress distribution during ther-
mal service. Tensile strength of WAAM sample increases after 1st thermal service and decreases after 10th thermal service. 
The existence of many dimples in the fracture indicates that the tensile fracture mode of the WAAM sample is microporous 
aggregation fracture. The number of dimples and particles in the fracture reduces significantly after the 10th thermal service, 
resulting in a decrease in fracture plasticity and tensile strength of the WAAM component."
66,Relationship between droplet transfer and forming quality in wire arc additive manufacturing of 2319 aluminum alloy,"Abstract
Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is widely studied due to its high deposition rate. However, WAAM samples have 
poor forming quality compared with other additive manufacturing technologies. The quality of sample formation is directly 
related to the time required for subsequent mechanical processing. Hence, cycle time can further be reduced by controlling 
the forming quality. Additionally, better forming quality results in less material wastage. Therefore, the forming quality 
of samples has always been the focus of WAAM. In this paper, the droplet transfer process of the WAAM is shot with a 
high-speed camera. This article attempts to explain the WAAM forming process from the perspective of droplet transfer 
and evaluate the influence mechanism of droplet transfer on the side surface forming quality. High-speed photography is 
used to extract the molten pool size and droplet transfer frequency. The study also explored the variation of these factors 
with wire feed speed and number of layers. A two-dimensional droplet transfer model is established based on the results of 
high-speed photography to study the droplet transfer process. Next, the 3D sample model is built to obtain the roughness of 
deposition samples. Finally, the relationship between the forming quality and droplet transfer process is studied through the 
fitting planes. The relationship model of wire feeding speed, molten pool length/droplet transfer frequency, and roughness 
is obtained. The roughness of the side surface increases with higher wire feed speeds when the wire feed speed is 5.5–6.5 m/
min. However, at a wire feed speed of 7.0 m/min, the roughness of the side surface suddenly decreases. The droplet transfer 
motion rule is then used to explain this change in forming quality."
66,The microstructure diversity in different areas of the ring-route Al 6061-T6 additive zone by friction stir additive manufacturing,"Abstract
Friction stir additive manufacturing technology has emerged as an efficient solid-state process option that provides superior 
connectivity for lightweight structural material with equiaxed microstructures and outstanding mechanical properties. In this 
paper, a multilayer ring-shaped build made from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy using friction stir additive manufacturing (FSAM) 
was characterized. The rotating torque exerted on the friction tool by the surrounding material was measured as it moves 
to the middle and the end of the ring. Additionally, the correlation between the microstructure and the rotating torque was 
investigated. The results revealed a significant decrease in rotating torque when the stir tool returned to its original position 
in the additive zone, leading to a reduction in grain size within the additive zone. Underneath the bottom of the stir zone, 
there was an overlapping interface filled with deformed grains. Along the horizontal direction, the highest hardness existed 
in the base material region, while the lowest value appeared in the mixed area of the thermal–mechanical affected zone and 
heat-affected zone. The hardness value of the stir zone was found to be intermediate between the base material region and the 
mixed area of the thermal–mechanical affected zone and heat-affected zone. The highest and lowest hardness values along 
the tool-axial direction were observed at the top of the stir zone and the overlapping interface below it."
66,"Weld morphology, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties of laser beam welding of wire arc additive manufactured Al-Cu substrate","Abstract
Laser welding is a feasible process for joining the additive manufactured (AMed) parts to meet the manufacturing demand 
of specific large-scale components. Microstructure and property evolution as well as weldability of the laser welding of wire 
arc additive manufactured (WAAMed) Al-Cu alloy are investigated. Results indicate that the WAAMed Al-Cu alloy has 
excellent laser weldability and the joint is nearly free of defect. The width of the heat-affected-zone (HAZ) and equiaxed 
crystal zone (EQZ) as well as the grain size of the fusion zone (FZ) will increase with higher laser power and heat input. 
The joint with laser power of 3500 W has the highest tensile strength and elongation, reaching 203.48 MPa and 4.13%. The 
result from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) test indicates that the texture intensity will affect tensile properties. The 
tensile strength and elongation of the laser welded WAAM sample perpendicular to the deposition direction are higher than 
that parallel to the deposition direction. The microhardness value of HAZ is higher than that of FZ and BM due to 163 HV. 
The feasibility of laser welding of WAAMed samples is validated, and process parameters are found for hybrid manufactur-
ing of large-scale components."
66,"Study on the distribution, element characteristics, and formation mechanism of porosity during laser welding for Ti-6Al-4 V bottom-locking joint","Abstract
The bottom-locking joint is widely used in the aerospace manufacturing field as an imperative connection structure. The laser welding 
experiment for the Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy bottom-locking joint is carried out in the present paper. Meanwhile, porosity in the weld 
seam including the process porosity and metallurgical porosity is investigated. Furthermore, it is novel that the distribution, element char-
acteristics, and formation mechanism of process porosities and metallurgical porosities in the bottom-locking joint are comprehensively 
analysed based on the porosity morphology, microstructure, and element analysis of the resultant bottom-locking joints. The process 
porosity, which mainly appeared in the weld seam centre, is formed by the combined effect of two mechanisms which closely related to the 
dynamic behaviour of the molten pool and the stability of the keyhole. Besides, a large number of micropores with a diameter of 2–5 µm 
are observed on the surface of the process porosity, whose formation is related to the evaporation of elements. Moreover, the tensile stress 
generated during the solidification and shrinkage of the molten metal is the main factor leading to microcracks in the micropores. The 
nucleation characteristics of bubbles cause metallurgical porosities to be mainly distributed at the bottom of the weld seam."
66,Effect of thermal behavior on the grain morphology and dimension of 80-mm-thick Ti6Al4V plates joined by laser melting deposition,"Abstract
As the material experiences non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction under different thermal behavior during laser 
melting deposition (LMD), the microstructure of the components will be affected, which also causes changes in mechanical 
properties. It is essential to understand the thermal behavior of the melt pool during LMD to improve the microstructure  
and joint quality. In this study, two 80-mm-thick Ti6Al4V plates are successfully joined using three different scanning 
speeds (10, 15, and 20 mm/s). The effects of thermal behavior on the grain morphology and dimension of deposition area, 
equiaxed crystal zone (EQZ), and the substrate at different scanning speeds are quantitatively analyzed. The results show 
that the fine equiaxed crystals are formed near the joint boundary due to the high-temperature gradient and cooling rate. 
The growth direction of fine columnar crystals continuously changes from the joint boundary to the center of the deposition 
area due to the change of heat-extraction direction. However, the epitaxial growth direction of the coarse columnar crystal 
is the same as the previous deposition layer at the center of the deposition area. Given the effect of high heat accumulation 
and low-temperature gradient during LMD, the dimension of columnar crystal is coarsen significantly at the center of the 
deposition area."
66,Influence of different micro-pattern types on interface characteristic and mechanical property of CFRTP/aluminum alloy laser bonding joint,"Abstract
Laser direct joining of carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP) to aluminum alloy with diverse surface 
micro-patterns was performed. The influence of micro-pattern type on interface characteristic and mechanical property of 
CFRTP/aluminum alloy laser bonding joint was concerned especially. Prior to the laser joining, two different micro-patterns 
including groove structure and circular hole structure were fabricated on the metal surface using nanosecond pulsed laser. 
Then, the appearance of joint and the morphology at joining interface were observed by optical microscope and scanning 
electron microscope. Moreover, the tensile shear test was conducted to obtain the fracture load and fracture surface mor-
phology. The results indicated that the cross section of the groove structure was a trapezoid, while that of the circular hole 
structure was a triangle with a large ratio of depth to diameter. In spite of the more pores existed at the interface of joints 
with circular hole structure, this type of micro-pattern strengthened the mechanical anchoring effect between CFRTP and 
aluminum alloy more significantly. With the change of micro-pattern from groove structure to circular hole structure, the 
maximum tensile load of laser bonding joint increased from 1616.40 to 2623.40 N, and the main failure mode transformed 
from interface failure to cohesive failure. The micro-pattern fabricated on the metal surface before the laser joining process 
is an effective approach to obtain the larger bonding area and higher mechanical strength of laser bonding joint."
66,Droplet Transfer Induced Keyhole Fluctuation and Its Influence Regulation on Porosity Rate during Hybrid Laser Arc Welding of Aluminum Alloys,"Abstract: Hybrid laser arc welding (HLAW) features advantages such as higher welding speed and gap
tolerance as well as smaller welding deformation and heat-affected zone than arc welding. Porosity
in hybrid laser arc weld due to keyhole fluctuation tends to be the initial source of crack propagation,
which will significantly diminish the weld performance. A high-speed imaging technique was adopted
to record and analyze the droplet transfer and keyhole fluctuation behavior during hybrid laser arc
welding of aluminum alloys. A heat transfer and fluid flow model of HLAW was established and
validated for a perspective of the evolution process of droplet transfer and keyhole fluctuation. The
relationship between keyhole fluctuation and weld porosity was also revealed. During the droplet
transfer stage, liquid metal on the top surface of the weld pool flows toward the keyhole originated by
globular transfer, and the keyhole fluctuates and decreases significantly, which has a higher tendency
to form a bubble in the weld pool. The bubble evolves into porosity once trapped in the mush-zone
near the trailing edge of the weld pool. Therefore, globular transfer during HLAW is the principal
origin of keyhole fluctuation and weld porosity. Welding current has a significant influence on keyhole
fluctuation and weld porosity rate. Droplet transfer frequency, keyhole fluctuation, and porosity rate
increase with higher welding current under the globular transfer mode. The porosity rate shows a
nearly positive correlation with the standard deviation of keyhole fluctuation."
66,Relationship between Stress State and Microstructure of 7B04 Aluminum Alloy Surface Fatigue Properties by Laser Shock Peening Improvement,"Abstract: Fatigue performance is always an important factor affecting the application of aluminum
alloys. The service life of the 7B04 aluminum alloy tends to reduce under continuous alternating
loads. Therefore, a new method is urgently needed to improve fatigue performance. Laser shock
peening (LSP) is a widely proposed method to enhance fatigue performance. It is found that LSP
can prolong the fatigue life of 7B04 by improving the surface stress state. During the strengthening
process, the residual stress is mainly attributed to the change in microstructure, which the statistical
results of grain size can reﬂect. The microhardness of the treated 7B04 is 22.7% higher than that of the
untreated sample. In addition, there is a signiﬁcant residual compressive stress from the specimen
surface to its interior of about 1500 µm after the process of laser shock peening. The fatigue life is
extended to 93%, and the ultimate fracture changes macroscopically. The fatigue performance of 7B04
is greatly improved by the LSP treatment. The strengthening mechanism of LSP is established to
reveal the relationship between microstructure and stress state to improve the fatigue performance of
metal parts of any shape."
66,Wear and Corrosion Resistance of FeCoCrxNiAl High-Entropy Alloy Coatings Fabricated by Laser Cladding on Q345 Welded Joint,"Abstract: High-entropy alloy (HEA) coatings on the surface of low-alloy steel by laser cladding can
improve the corrosion and wear resistance, and the performance can be further improved by adding
the Cr element. However, the effect of Cr content on the microstructure, hardness, wear and corrosion
resistance of the coatings on the welded joint has not been completely understood in the literature.
This paper aims at revealing the inﬂuence of Cr content on the microstructure and properties of
laser-cladded FeCoCrxNiAl HEA on different regions of Q345 welded structure. The results indicate
that FeCoCrxNiAl HEA coating has good metallurgical bonding with the Q345 welded surface. The
increase of Cr element content in the powder plays an important role in energy absorption of powder
and substrate, affecting the dilution rate and diffusion of Fe from the substrate to HEA coating. The
HEA coating is mainly composed of the face-centered cubic phase (FCC) and body-centered cubic
phase (BCC). When x ="
67,A new Framework for the Spectral Information Decomposition of Multivariate Gaussian Processes,"Abstract— Different
information-theoretic
measures
are
available in the literature for the study of pairwise and higher-
order interactions in multivariate dynamical systems. While
these measures operate in the time domain, several physiological
and non-physiological systems exhibit a rich oscillatory content
that is typically analyzed in the frequency domain through
spectral and cross-spectral approaches. For Gaussian systems,
the relation between information and spectral measures has
been established considering coupling and causality measures,
but not for higher-order interactions. To ﬁll this gap, in this
work we introduce an information-theoretic framework in the
frequency domain to quantify the information shared between
a target process and two sources, even multivariate, and to
highlight the presence of redundancy and synergy in the
analyzed dynamical system. Firstly, we simulate different linear
interacting processes by showing the capability of the proposed
framework to retrieve amounts of information shared by the
processes in speciﬁc frequency bands which are not detectable
by the related time-domain measures. Then, the framework is
applied on EEG time series representative of the brain activity
during a motor execution task in a group of healthy subjects.

development of ultra-low-power analog front ends for edge AI, 
the low selective frequency accuracy of these front ends causes 
high training load on the AI part and high-test cost. In this

is to provide a proof-of-concept demonstrating the applicability

in which it enables unobtrusive ongoing health monitoring.
This applicationpresents two ubiquitouschallengestypical of
sensing applications of the Internet of Things: limited dataset
size and dataset imbalance. Recently, data augmentation has
emerged as a way of addressing their negative inﬂuences on
the training process without overburdening the data acqui-

ing which methods should be applied to time series and in

analysis that synergistically combines multiple approaches.
These approaches are benchmarked on a dataset of triaxial

Our results indicate that integrating data augmentation with
the training process can substantially improve the time-series classiﬁcation performance while retaining a ﬁxed
convolutional neural network architecture. The improvement is maximized when the dataset is balanced by applying
a suitable sampling scheme and the negative inﬂuence of data duplication is reduced via generating synthetic time

the classiﬁcation accuracy of an under-represented behavior, namely, grazing, is elevated from 45% to 91%. This work
provides a direction toward a general methodology, motivating research on other datasets and applications."
67,Microsecond-level Real-time Ethernet Deterministic Bus (REDBUS): Architecture and motor control experiments,"ABSTRACT For decades, real-time digital control systems have enabled countless applications across
industry, transportation, defense, and science. A more recent trend is enhancing their interconnections using
hardware and protocols, delivering timing performance comparable with that of the controllers themselves,
thus enabling considerably more complex forms of real-time coordination over multiple devices, such as
robot axes. Several industry standards have emerged, primarily leveraging existing IEEE802.3 Ethernet
hardware and differing levels of the associated stack. However, these are generally proprietary and involve
complex software libraries, which are desirable in terms of abstraction and multi-vendor interoperability
but are not well-suited for situations where low-cost, small-size, and high-reliability remotization of
individual sensors and actuators are required. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach
known as the Real-time Ethernet Deterministic Bus (REDBUS), which is characterized by an atypical
usage of the IEEE802.3 physical layer, rewired according to a daisy-chain topology, yielding a sort of
token-passing network. The cascaded devices replace control values with sensor readings on the fly at
predetermined frame locations under a minimalist framework devoid of any software layers. The concepts
and implementation are described in detail, an example code is provided, and representative results on the
real-time control of high-speed stepper and brushless motors are presented. Due to the lack of abstraction,
security, scalability, diagnostics, and multi-protocol integration features, REDBUS cannot replace the
existing industrial Ethernet standards on the factory floor. Rather, it aims to complement them within
predetermined designs, such as individual pieces of equipment that represent closed ecosystems, where
complexity, size, and timing requirements are more pressing and where the entire data flow allocation
and timings can be fixed ab initio. Diverse engineering fields can directly benefit from this simple and
unconstrained architecture for meeting demanding experiment control and data acquisition requirements."

the ﬁeld of nonlinear dynamics. However, the dynamic reg-

Also, variable boosting can be achieved by varying the
initial values, indicating that the system has homogenous

continuously distributed attractors. This memristive sys-
tem provides the ﬁrst example with uncountably many co-
existing hyperchaotic attractors without any periodic func-

Internet of Things (IoT) sensors has given rise to a syn-
ergistic paradigm known as AIoT, wherein AI functions as
the decision-maker and sensors collect information. How-
ever, a substantial proportion of AIoT rely on cloud-based
AI, which process wirelessly transmitted raw data, increas-
ing power consumption and reducing battery life at sensor
nodes. Edge-AI has emerged as a promising alternative,
implementing AI directly on sensor nodes, eliminating the
need of raw data transmission. Despite its potential, there is
a scarcity of hardware architectures optimized for resource-
constrained platforms, such as field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs), particularly for low-frequency sensors. This
work presents a shared-scale integer-only recurrent neural
network (RNN) implemented on a Lattice ICE40UP5K FPGA
using a resource-minimized time and layer-multiplexed (TLM)
hardware architecture. This architecture adopts real-time pro-
cessing, setting clock frequency to complete a single RNN timestep preceding the next sensor sample, reducing power
consumption significantly. Measurements on this FPGA implementing our proposed architecture applied to a pretrained
RNN on cow behavior show a power consumption of 360 µW at a clock frequency of 146 kHz and negligible accuracy loss
at 8-bit bitwidth. This finding suggests that our methods lead to the most accurate implementation of animal behavior
estimation with a power consumption below 500 µW on an FPGA. The implementation in Systemverilog and Python code
is publicly available, enabling adaptation of the RNN for various tasks involving low-frequency sensors on resource-
constrained FPGAs, thereby contributing to the further advancement and democratization of Edge-AI solutions."
67,"Received January 24, 2022, accepted February 4, 2022, date of publication February 7, 2022, date of current version February 16, 2022.","ABSTRACT We exemplify an interdisciplinary approach wherein a mesoscopic-scale functional model
of a biological system is derived from time-series recordings, yielding transfer functions that can be used
to design analog electronic circuits. Namely, sensory processing in the honey bee, a universal model for
studying olfaction, is considered. Existing studies have focused on its antennal lobe, wherein only the
responses of its functional units, known as glomeruli, have been accessible. Here, high temporal resolution
calcium imaging is deployed to track the dynamics of odor-evoked activity beyond this processing stage.
The responses in the somata outside of the antennal lobe are recorded, showing for the ﬁrst time how the
glomerular signals are transformed before entering the higher brain centers. A transfer function approach is
applied to capture as a ‘‘gray box model’’ the remarkably heterogeneous signal transformations between
odor input and glomerular response, and between glomerular signals and somata activity. The somata
are tentatively mapped to the glomeruli via Granger causality, while machine learning classiﬁcation and
clustering allow grouping common properties regarding response amplitudes and temporal proﬁles. The
obtained low-order transfer functions display time- and frequency-domain input-output properties closely
similar to the biological system. Because transfer functions have universal applicability, once they have
been determined, it is readily possible to design corresponding analog electronic circuits, with possible
future applications in sensor signal conditioning. To exemplify this, examples based on resistor-capacitor

quality and reducing methane emissions, but requires continuous and reliable data on the animal’s behavior.
While systems suitable for use within the barn exist, grazing over long distances poses challenges. Here,
we address this issue by proposing an ultra low-power Edge AI device, minimizing data transmission require-

67,An Information-Theoretic Framework to Measure the Dynamic Interaction Between Neural Spike Trains,"Abstract—Objective: While understanding the interac-
tion patterns among simultaneous recordings of spike
trains from multiple neuronal units is a key topic in
neuroscience, existing methods either do not consider
the inherent point-process nature of spike trains or are
based on parametric assumptions. This work presents
an information-theoretic framework for the model-free,
continuous-time estimation of both undirected (symmetric)
and directed (Granger-causal) interactions between spike
trains. Methods: The framework computes the mutual infor-
mation rate (MIR) and the transfer entropy rate (TER) for two
point processes X and Y , showing that the MIR between
X and Y can be decomposed as the sum of the TER along
the directions X →Y and Y →X. We present theoretical
expressions and introduce strategies to estimate efﬁciently
the two measures through nearest neighbor statistics. Re-
sults: Using simulations of independent and coupled point
processes, we show the accuracy of MIR and TER to assess
interactions even for weakly coupled and short realizations,
and demonstrate the superiority of continuous-time estima-
tion over the standard discrete-time approach. We also ap-
ply the MIR and TER to real-world data, speciﬁcally, record-
ings from in-vitro preparations of spontaneously-growing
cultures of cortical neurons. Using this dataset, we demon-
strate the ability of MIR and TER to describe how the func-
tional networks between recording units emerge over the
course of the maturation of the neuronal cultures. Conclu-
sion and Signiﬁcance: the proposed framework provides
principled measures to assess undirected and directed

67,"Connectivity Influences on Nonlinear Dynamics in Weakly-Synchronized Networks: Insights From R&#x00F6;ssler Systems, Electronic Chaotic Oscillators, Model and Biological Neurons","ABSTRACT
Natural and engineered networks, such as interconnected neurons, ecological and social
networks, coupled oscillators, wireless terminals and power loads, are characterized by an appreciable
heterogeneity in the local connectivity around each node. For instance, in both elementary structures such
as stars and complex graphs having scale-free topology, a minority of elements are linked to the rest
of the network disproportionately strongly. While the effect of the arrangement of structural connections
on the emergent synchronization pattern has been studied extensively, considerably less is known about
its inﬂuence on the temporal dynamics unfolding within each node. Here, we present a comprehensive
investigation across diverse simulated and experimental systems, encompassing star and complex networks
of Rössler systems, coupled hysteresis-based electronic oscillators, microcircuits of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre
model neurons, and ﬁnally recordings from in-vitro cultures of spontaneously-growing neuronal networks.
We systematically consider a range of dynamical measures, including the correlation dimension, nonlinear
prediction error, permutation entropy, and other information-theoretical indices. The empirical evidence
gathered reveals that under situations of weak synchronization, wherein rather than a collective behavior one
observes signiﬁcantly differentiated dynamics, denser connectivity tends to locally promote the emergence
of stronger signatures of nonlinear dynamics. In deterministic systems, transition to chaos and generation
of higher-dimensional signals were observed; however, when the coupling is stronger, this relationship
may be lost or even inverted. In systems with a strong stochastic component, the generation of more
temporally-organized activity could be induced. These observations have many potential implications across
diverse ﬁelds of basic and applied science, for example, in the design of distributed sensing systems based
on wireless coupled oscillators, in network identiﬁcation and control, as well as in the interpretation of
neuroscientiﬁc and other dynamical data."
67,Chaotic circuit based on physical memristor,"Abstract—In this paper, we brieﬂy discuss the main features
of the memristor-based autonomous oscillator introduced and
extensively characterized in [1]. The circuit is based on two
feedback loops, a linear one and a non-linear one involving a
self-directed channel memristor. In particular, we consider two
different types of devices, one tungsten-based and one carbon-
based, and show experimental results proving that chaos can be
readily obtained in both cases, despite the device non-idealities.

This work presents a current-starved cross-coupled chaotic 
oscillator achieving multiple decades of oscillation frequency 
spanning 2 kHz to 15 MHz. The main circuit characteristics are 
low-power consumption (<100 nW to 25 μW, at 1 V supply 
voltage), and controllability of the oscillation frequency, enabling 
future applications such as in distributed environmental sensing. 
The IC was implemented in 180 nm standard CMOS process, 
yielding a core area of 0.028 mm2."
67,Current-Starved Cross-Coupled CMOS Inverter Rings as Versatile Generators of Chaotic and Neural-Like Dynamics Over Multiple Frequency Decades,"ABSTRACT The generation of chaotic signals is relevant to a multitude of applications across telecommuni-
cations, random number generation, control, and the realization of distributed sensing systems; in addition,
networks of coupled chaotic oscillators replicate diverse emergent phenomena occurring in considerably
larger biological neural systems. However, to date, the generation of chaotic signals by means of comple-
mentary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) integrated circuits has been hampered largely by the need to implement
reactive elements, and by limited ﬂexibility. In this paper, we introduce a pure CMOS implementation of a
chaos generator based on three inverter rings having lengths equal to the smallest odd prime numbers, i.e., 3,
5, and 7. These rings are cross-coupled via diodes of diverse strengths enabled through pass-gates, and the
inverters in the rings are independently current-starved. Through numerical simulations and experiments,
it is shown that this new topology can generate chaotic signals over at least four frequency decades.
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the experimental devices have access to a multitude of qualitatively-
different dynamical behaviors as a function of the starving currents. In particular, the generation of spiking
and bursting signals reminiscent of action potentials are observed, both with and without slower ﬂuctuations
which resemble ﬁeld potentials. Furthermore, instances of oscillation quenching are found, wherein the
circuit acts as a nonlinear ampliﬁer yielding 1/f-like stochastic signals. This compact and ﬂexible topology
promises to become a foundational cell in the design of integrated circuits requiring area-efﬁcient, low-
power, and controllable chaos generation."
67,Distributed Sensing Via Inductively Coupled Single-Transistor Chaotic Oscillators: A New Approach and Its Experimental Proof-of-Concept,"ABSTRACT Emerging applications across environmental, biomedical, and structural monitoring require the
measurement of physical variables over extended regions. Because addressing many sensors individually can
result in impractical bandwidth and power requirements, there is a need for distributed sensing approaches
wherein readouts are obtained directly at the ensemble level. In turn, this generally requires sensor nodes
capable of interacting with each other to implement the required readout statistic. Here, the ﬁrst practical
steps towards approaching this challenge via a nonlinear analog approach based on chaotic synchronization
are presented. Namely, single-transistor oscillators, representing remarkably low-complexity yet highly-
ﬂexible entities, are experimentally found to be suitable for wireless coupling via mutual induction,
realizing a simple form of telemetry for luminous ﬂux. Via numerical simulations and numerous laboratory
experiments, a rich repertoire of possible interactions among multiple sensor nodes and between the same
and an external exciter is demonstrated, encompassing synchronization, desynchronization, relay effects,
and chaotic transitions. Together, these results reveal the possibility and means of accurately estimating the
average of a distributed physical magnitude from the complexity of ensemble dynamics. This new approach
contributes an important blueprint for future work using simple chaotic circuits in sensing applications."
67,"iFLEX: A Fully Open-Source, High-Density Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Hardware Co-Processor for Vector Similarity Searching","ABSTRACT
Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against a high volume
of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-
norm, or Hamming distance. Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations
are developing rapidly across artiﬁcial intelligence ﬁelds as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval
of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered
materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central
processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel
computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing
units (GPU) and ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the
design materials for these systems remains largely conﬁned to a small number of corporations and research
institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching,
based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed
on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be
seamlessly reconﬁgured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software
architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance
calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on
both single- and multi-node system conﬁgurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host
software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and
research in this area."
67,"Hybrid Control of a Vision-Guided Robot Arm by EOG, EMG, EEG Biosignals and Head Movement Acquired via a Consumer-Grade Wearable Device","ABSTRACT Simultaneous acquisition of electrooculogram, jaw electromyogram, electroencephalogram,
and head movement via consumer-grade wearable devices has become possible. Such devices offer new
opportunities to deploy practical biosignal-based interfaces for assistive robots; however, they also pose chal-
lenges related to the available signals and their characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate
the possibility of successful control of a 5 + 1 degrees-of-freedom robot arm based on a consumer wireless
headband in the form of four control modes predicated on distinct signal combinations. We propose a control
approach hybrid at two levels, which seeks a compromise between robot controllability and maintaining the
user goal rather than being process-focused. First, robot arm steering combines discrete and proportional
aspects. Second, after the robot has been steered toward the approximate target direction, a sparse approach is
followed and the user only needs to issue a single command, after which steering adjustment and grasping are
performed automatically under stereoscopic vision guidance. We present in detail the associated algorithms,
whose implementation is publicly available. Within this framework, we also demonstrate the control of
arm posture and grasping force based, respectively, on object visual features and user input. We regard the
interface proposed herein as a viable blueprint for future work on controlling wheelchair-mounted and meal-
assisting robot arms."
67,Measuring High-Order Interactions in Rhythmic Processes Through Multivariate Spectral Information Decomposition,"ABSTRACT Many complex systems in physics, biology and engineering are modeled as dynamical networks
and described using multivariate time series analysis. Recent developments have shown that the emergent
dynamics of a network system are signiﬁcantly affected by interactions involving multiple network nodes
which cannot be described using pairwise links. While these higher-order interactions can be probed using
information-theoretic measures, a rigorous framework to describe them in the frequency domain is still
lacking. This work presents an approach for the spectral decomposition of multivariate information measures,
capable of identifying higher-order synergistic and redundant interactions between oscillatory processes.
We show theoretically that synergy and redundancy can coexist at different frequencies among the output
signals of a network system and can be detected only using the proposed spectral method. To demonstrate the
broad applicability of the framework, we provide parametric and non-parametric data-efﬁcient estimators for
the spectral information measures, and employ them to describe multivariate interactions in three complex
systems producing rich oscillatory dynamics, namely the human brain, a ring of electronic oscillators,
and the global climate system. In these systems, we show that the use of our framework for the spectral
decomposition of information measures reveals multivariate and higher-order interactions not detectable in
the time domain. Our results are exemplary of how the frequency-speciﬁc analysis of multivariate dynamics
can aid the implementation of assessment and control strategies in real-world network systems."
67,Versatile Locomotion Control of a Hexapod Robot Using a Hierarchical Network of Nonlinear Oscillator Circuits,"ABSTRACT A novel hierarchical network based on coupled nonlinear oscillators is proposed for motor
pattern generation in hexapod robots. Its architecture consists of a central pattern generator (CPG), pro-
ducing the global leg coordination pattern, coupled with six local pattern generators, each devoted to
generating the trajectory of one leg. Every node comprises a simple nonlinear oscillator and is well-suited
for implementation in a standard ﬁeld-programmable analog array device. The network enables versatile
locomotion control based on ﬁve high-level parameters which determine the inter-oscillator coupling pattern
via simple rules. The controller was realized on dedicated hardware, deployed to control an ant-like hexapod
robot, and multi-sensory telemetry was performed. As a function of a single parameter, it was able to
stably reproduce the canonical gaits observed in six-legged insects, namely the wave, tetrapod, and tripod
gaits. A second parameter enabled driving the robot in ant-like and cockroach-like postures. Three further
parameters enabled inhibiting and resuming walking, steering, and producing uncoordinated movement.
Emergent phenomena were observed in the form of a multitude of intermediate gaits and of hysteresis
and metastability close to a point of gait transition. The primary contributions of this paper reside in the
hierarchical controller architecture and associated approach for collapsing a large set of low-level parameters,
stemming from the complex hexapod kinematics, into only ﬁve high-level parameters. Such parameters can
be changed dynamically, an aspect of broad practical relevance opening new avenues for driving hexapod
robots via afferent signals from other circuits representing higher brain areas, or by means of suitable
brain-computer interfaces. An additional contribution is the detailed characterization via telemetry of
the physical robot, involving the deﬁnition of parameters which may aid future comparison with other
controllers. The present results renew interest into analog CPG architectures and reinforce the generality
of the connectionist approach."
68,Toward General Cross-Modal Signal Reconstruction for Robotic Teleoperation,"Abstract—The
multi-modal
robotic
teleoperation,
as
an
important application in human-computer interaction (HCI), is
playing a signiﬁcant role in various domains such as industry,
healthcare, and education. However, existing robotic teleoperation
systems face signiﬁcant challenges with multi-modal signals,
primarily in designing a cross-modal communication architecture
that caters to diverse modal requirements and ensuring high-
quality cross-modal signal reconstruction even in poor network
conditions. To this end, this work proposes a general cross-modal
signal reconstruction scheme by taking full advantage of the
correlation among different modality signals. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst
propose a scalable cross-modal communication architecture that
meets the diverse needs of various modality signals using multi-
modal encoding and multi-directional decoding, eliminating the
need for a specialized feature extraction model. Next, we design
a masked auto-encoder with discriminator assistance (MAE-
D) cross-modal signal reconstruction method, which leverages
the idea of generative confrontation by combining the codec
for signal reconstruction with the discriminator responsible
for assessing the authenticity of the reconstructed signal to
achieve accurate and efﬁcient cross-modal signal reconstruction.
Finally, numerical experiments conducted on our self-built multi-
modal dataset, a public dataset, and a teleoperation simulation
platform demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers signiﬁcant
advantages in cross-modal signal reconstruction.

68,Cross-Scale Haptic Object Recognition for Intelligent Robot,"Abstract—Haptic technology enables robots to touch and un-
derstand the interactions between objects in the reality. Advanced
haptic sensing systems can not only collect pressure, temperature
and stiffness of touched objects, but also avoid destructive oper-
ations, and assist in navigation and posture control for robots. In
order to smoothly interact with different types of objects, in the
haptic system, it is necessary to develop haptic object recognition
methods for effective haptic perception capability. However,
compared to RGB images, haptic images collected by optically-
based haptic sensors are similar in appearance, which makes
traditional convolutional neural networks (e.g.,ResNet, VGG, etc.)
ineffective. Therefore, in this paper, we are inspired by popular
attention mechanism and multi-scale strategies, and propose a
cross-scale attention based haptic object recognition network for
object-robot interaction. In particular, On the one hand, we
design a cross-scale attention module in convolutional neural
networks to acquire spatial contextual feature. On the other hand,
we design a learnable bilinear fusion strategy to integrate above
spatial contextual feature with original haptic feature, so as to
effectively discriminate haptic images. Experimental results on
ViTac dataset have shown the effectiveness of our approach."
68,Cross-Modal Object Detection Via UAV,"Abstract—UAV-based object detection aims at locating and
recognizing targets in aerial images, which is widely applied to
trafﬁc surveillance, disaster rescue and anomaly monitoring.
However, due to expensive sensors and complicated architectures,
it is unrealistic to deploy precise but heavy multi-modal object
detectors into UAV nodes. To get over the dilemma, inspired by
model compression and cross-modal signal processing techniques,
this paper proposes a cross-modal knowledge distillation (CKD)
enabled object detection paradigm, which achieves comparable
detection performance with multi-modal techniques, yet requires
less computational resource. On the one hand, in order to
avoid transferring redundant feature knowledge, we design a
Selective Feature Imitation (SFI) to selectively shorten the distance
between cross-modal features according to their types. On the
other hand, in order to transfer the most valuable prediction
knowledge, we design an Adaptive Prediction Imitation (API). It
evaluates the quality of prediction knowledge, and then adaptively
adjusts the distillation intensity for cross-modal prediction.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset have shown
the performance improvement of the proposed scheme."
68,A teacher-student based attention network for fine-grained image recognition,"Abstract
Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) task is dedicated to distinguishing similar sub-categories that belong to the same super-
category, such as bird species and car types. In order to highlight visual differences, existing FGIR works often follow two
steps: discriminative sub-region localization and local feature representation. However, these works pay less attention on
global context information. They neglect a fact that the subtle visual difference in challenging scenarios can be highlighted
through exploiting the spatial relationship among different sub-regions from a global view point. Therefore, in this paper,
we consider both global and local information for FGIR, and propose a collaborative teacher-student strategy to reinforce
and unity the two types of information. Our framework is implemented mainly by convolutional neural network, referred to
Teacher-Student Based Attention Convolutional Neural Network (T-S-ACNN). For fine-grained local information, we choose
the classic multi-attention network (MA-Net) as our baseline, and propose a type of boundary constraint to further reduce
background noises in the local attention maps. In this way, the discriminative sub-regions tend to appear in the area occupied
by fine-grained objects, leading to more accurate sub-region localization. For fine-grained global information, we design a
graph convolution based global attention network (GA-Net), which can combine extracted local attention maps from MA-Net
with non-local techniques to explore spatial relationship among sub-regions. At last, we develop a collaborative teacher-student
strategy to adaptively determine the attended roles and optimization modes, so as to the cooperative reinforcement of MA-Net
and GA-Net. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft datasets illustrate the promising
performance of our framework.

68,Hybrid Attention Fusion Segmentation Network for Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma in PET-CT,"Abstract—Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type
of lymphoma with a high incidence in Asia. Positron emission
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is usually used as
the evaluation means for DLBCL. Theoretically, the effective
combination of the PET and CT can display the shape, size and
location of the tumor. In practice, manual lesion segmentation
of PET-CT is time-consuming. Hence, in this work, we design
a hybrid attention fusion segmentation network (HAFS-Net) for
automatic segmentation task. Most works only pay attention to
extract information from multi-modal images, but ignore the
potential correlations between them, which is ineffective for
segmentation. In contrast, our network combines hybrid attention
mechanism and PET-CT feature fusion module, which can fully
mine correlations between multi-modal information. Speciﬁcally,
the hybrid attention exploits the tumor region enhancement prop-
erties of PET to guide segmentation on CT. And the irrelevant
noise regions on CT which interfere with the segmentation will
be suppressed. In PET-CT feature fusion module, the supervision
information (attention fusion map on PET-CT) is efﬁciently ap-
plied to assist segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed framework can effectively complete the task
of multi-modal medical image segmentation."
68,Multi-scale/attention Convolutional Network for Diffuse Large B Lymphoma Segmentation in PET Image,"Abstract—Diffuse large B lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the
most frequent lymphomas, and Positron emission tomography
(PET) is an important imaging tool for tumor diagnosis. It can
be used to obtain information such as tumor size, location, etc.
Clinically, manual segmentation of lesions is time-consuming
and labor-intensive. Therefore, in this paper we propose an
automatic segmentation model called CBS-APU-Net based on
U-Net framework. This model fuses multiple scale and attention
mechanisms. During downsampling phase, the CBS module uti-
lizes multi-scale convolution to extract high-dimensional features,
and the local receptive field is enlarged using the atrous spatial
pyramid pooling at the bottom of the model. The attention
mechanism is introduced in the skip connection part so as
to enhance the network attention of the lesion area in the
feature map. While in the upsampling part, the features after
high-dimensional deconvolution are fused with low-dimensional
features. Experimental results show that this model achieves
the best performance after 500 iterations, and the overall Dice
coefficient might reach 0.8189, which outperforms than current
models for DLBCL automatic segmentation."
68,Global Information-Assisted Fine-Grained Visual Categorization in Internet of Things,"Abstract—In ﬁne-grained visual categorization (FGVC), most
part-based frameworks do not work effectively in some extremely
challenging scenarios such as partial occlusion. This limitation
is due to the heavy disorder of local features extracted from
such occluded targets. To address this issue, we propose a global
information-assisted network (GIAN), where auxiliary global
information can search the useful elements of local information
and integrate with them for an efﬁcient uniﬁed feature represen-
tation. In particular, in order to acquire the global information,
we design a global attention-concentrated convolutional neu-
ral network (GAC-CNN) by extending a convolutional neural
network with a nonlocal GCN module. Then, the uniﬁed feature
representation is produced by two strategies. On the one hand,
a global–local aggregation strategy is developed to selectively
integrate global features with local features through consistency
evaluation and reweighting method. On the other hand, an
alternative knowledge distillation strategy is developed to help
generate more powerful global and local features. Two strategies
collaboratively make the uniﬁed features more robust and more
discriminative than traditional part-based features. Experimental
results show that the proposed GIAN can achieve accuracies of
92.8%, 93.8%, and 95.7% on CUB-200-2011, FGVC Aircraft,
and Stanford Cars, respectively."

Benefiting from the promise of sixth generation 
(6G) wireless networks, multimodal machine learn-
ing based on exploiting complementarity among 
video, audio, and haptic signals, becomes a key 
enabler for human intention recognition, which 
is critical to realize effective human-robot collab-
oration in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, as 
multimodal human intention recognition is limited 
by expensive equipment and a demanding envi-
ronment, it is hard to strike an efficient trade-off 
between inference accuracy and system overhead. 
Naturally, how to induce more intention semantics 
from readily available videos emerges as a funda-
mental issue for human intention recognition. In 
this article, we use cross-view human intention rec-
ognition to solve the above issue and demonstrate 
the effectiveness of our method with well-designed 
evaluation metrics. Specifically, we first compen-
sate for the scarcity of intention semantics in the 
body view by adding a face view. Second, we 
deploy the cross-view generative model to capture 
intention semantics induced by the mutual gen-
eration of two views. Finally, in the human-robot 
collaboration experiments, our method gets closer 
to human performance regarding response time 
and inference accuracy."
68,Haptic Signal Reconstruction in eHealth Internet of Things,"Abstract—With the haptic technology continuously enlarging
the eHealth Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem, hap-
tic perception service which requires effective haptic signal
reconstruction for immersive experience has become an indis-
pensable function. However, the majority of existing haptic
signal reconstruction methods are generally inefﬁcient because of
undergoing extremely complex operations or inefﬁcient feature
representations. To resolve this dilemma, this article proposes
a long short-term memory-based force reconstruction network
(LSTM-FRN) by designing a novel sparse attention module for
low-latency reconstruction and a novel metric learning-based
constraint for high-precision reconstruction, yielding an excel-
lent tradeoff between the computational complexity and feature
representation. To train our network, we construct a large-scale
data set of synchronous needle motion signals and haptic signals
in acupuncture needle insertion. Finally, we build an interactive
needle insertion training system (HapAR-NITS) by integrating
augmented reality (AR), the LSTM-FRN-based haptic recon-
struction as well as a skill assessment subsystem. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed multiple technolo-
gies enable our HapAR-NITS to achieve satisfying immersive
experience and manipulation effects."

in many IoT application ﬁelds. However, existing knowledge
graphs primarily focus on simple structured data, ignoring
complex data types that are increasingly popular in artiﬁcial
intelligence domain, such as image, video or text. In this paper,
we propose a new pipeline for visual knowledge graph(VKG), in
which visual relation detection and knowledge graph construction
are integrated into an end-to-end network structure. The pro-
posed network includes three parts 1) object localization, 2) visual
relation detection, 3) the construction of visual knowledge graph
by relation triples. In particular, we use information processed by
object detection to predict the relation between entities on visual
relation detection and obtain the knowledge triples. According to
the visual knowledge triples, we visualize the constructed visual
knowledge graph. The superiority of visual relation detection
are shown in the experiments over competitive baselines on the
common datasets. Moreover, we also show the performance of
visual knowledge graphs based on the result of relation detection."
68,An Attention-Based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Network for Location Prediction,"Abstract—Locating trajectories of users has become a popular
application in our daily life. How to effectively discriminate
the importance of various contextual information is crucial to
location prediction. Many works based on Recurrent Neural
Network(RNN) models have shown promising performance by
modeling the location prediction as a signal sequence processing
problem and incorporating diverse characteristics into the hidden
state of RNNs. However, these works rarely consider the internal
relationship between locations. To overcome this limitation, we
ﬁrstly propose a feedback mechanism to compensate for forward
propagation, which innovatively takes advantage of the regularity
of human trajectory. Then, we adopt the bidirectional Gated
Recurrent Unit(GRU) network combined with data augmentation
to model spatiotemporal information. Moreover, we focus on
more signiﬁcant factors with the attention mechanism during
training, which can enhance the reliability of prediction. Exper-
iments evaluate on three popular real-world datasets show that
our model yields remarkable improvements over the compared
methods."
68,Adaptive Multi-Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Fine-Grained Image Recognition,"Abstract—Fine-grained recognition is still a difficult task in 
pattern recognition applications due to the challenge of accurate 
localization of discriminative parts. Recent CNN-based methods 
generally utilize attention mechanism to produce attention masks 
without part labels/annotations and extract corresponding image 
parts from them. However, these methods extract the attention 
parts by using fixed-size rectangles to crop images regardless 
of the size of objects to be recognized, which will hinder the 
feature expression of the following Part-CNNs. In this paper, we 
propose an adaptive cropping module based on the information 
of attention masks to adjust size of cropping rectangles. The 
training process of adaptive cropping module and Part-CNNs can 
reinforce each other with the proposed rank loss and the classic 
softmax loss. To further balance and fuse all attention parts, we 
propose a part weighting module to evaluate part contributions. 
Under the optimization of sort loss, the part weighting module 
will produce part weights in the same order as prediction scores 
learned by attention parts. The backbone of our network is 
MA-CNN. Different from MA-CNN, the new proposed adaptive 
cropping module and part weighting module can jointly guide the 
framework to produce a more discriminative fine-grained feature. 
Experiments show that the AMA-CNN outperforms MA-CNN by"

offers a solution to sharpen focus and concentration. This study 
explores the relationship between concentration and the

tested with diya light, and their intensities and pixel values are 
measured to determine the most effective for concentration. 
Logistic regression is employed to train a model, which provides

the elevator is designed using reconfigurable based control and 
traffic is analyzed using computer vision algorithms. The 
computer vision algorithms such as KNN algorithm, background 
subtraction, masking, and binarization are used to determine the 
age and analyze the traffic. Moreover, assigning the priorities on 
the basis of traffic to the required floor makes the elevator 
accessible to everyone and to make the inter floor transportation

69,A Versatile Approach for Adaptive Grid Mapping and Grid Flex-Graph Exploration with a Field-Programmable Gate Array-Based Robot Using Hardware Schemes,"Abstract: Robotic exploration in dynamic and complex environments requires advanced adaptive
mapping strategies to ensure accurate representation of the environments. This paper introduces an
innovative grid flex-graph exploration (GFGE) algorithm designed for single-robot mapping. This
hardware-scheme-based algorithm leverages a combination of quad-grid and graph structures to
enhance the efficiency of both local and global mapping implemented on a field-programmable gate
array (FPGA). This novel research work involved using sensor fusion to analyze a robot’s behavior
and flexibility in the presence of static and dynamic objects. A behavior-based grid construction
algorithm was proposed for the construction of a quad-grid that represents the occupancy of frontier
cells. The selection of the next exploration target in a graph-like structure was proposed using
partial reconfiguration-based frontier-graph exploration approaches. The complete exploration
method handles the data when updating the local map to optimize the redundant exploration of
previously explored nodes. Together, the exploration handles the quadtree-like structure efficiently
under dynamic and uncertain conditions with a parallel processing architecture. Integrating several
algorithms into indoor robotics was a complex process, and a Xilinx-based partial reconfiguration
approach was used to prevent computing difficulties when running many algorithms simultaneously.
These algorithms were developed, simulated, and synthesized using the Verilog hardware description
language on Zynq SoC. Experiments were carried out utilizing a robot based on a field-programmable
gate array (FPGA), and the resource utilization and power consumption of the device were analyzed."
69,Sensor Enabled Smart Wearable for Hazard Detection,"Abstract: - Coal mining safety has been a longstanding 
concern, underscored by the alarming toll of worker fatalities. 
The hazardous nature of coal mining operations exposes 
workers to multiple risks, including carbon monoxide 
exposure and temperature fluctuations. To overcome these 
challenges, this study has developed a new model powered by 
an ESP8266 and sensors such as a gas detector, temperature 
sensor, and accelerometer. The proposed model proactively 
prioritizes worker wellbeing by identifying risks such as 
carbon monoxide, environmental changes, and fall detection. 
The developed device also includes a responsive buzzer and 
Telegram update to the user's mobile, ensuring a rapid 
emergency action. Verilog code has been methodically created 
for future FPGA deployment; it is now used as a preliminary 
step. The code's strategic design predicts optimal sensor data 
processing and takes advantage of the parallel processing 
capabilities inherent in FPGA architecture, resulting in faster 
real-time responses."
69,Internet of Things (IOT) based smart energy monitoring with ESP32 and using Thingspeak,"Abstract— The project aims to develop an IoT-based smart 
energy meter for efficient monitoring of energy consumption. 
The system utilizes advanced components including I2C 
communication protocol, LCD display, ZMPT101B voltage 
sensor, Hall effect sensor, all integrated around the ESP32 
processor. The primary objective is to provide users with real-
time insights into their energy consumption patterns, enabling 
informed decisions for energy efficiency and conservation. The 
proposed system employs the ESP32 processor as the central

Through 
the 
I2C

ZMPT101B voltage sensor and Hall effect sensor enables precise 
measurement of voltage and current parameters, allowing for 
accurate energy consumption calculations. The data collected 
from these sensors is processed and displayed in real-time on the 
LCD display, providing users with comprehensive insights into 
their energy usage. Furthermore, the IoT capabilities of the 
system enable remote monitoring and control of energy 
consumption via internet connectivity. Users can access the 
energy consumption data through a web interface or a dedicated 
mobile application, facilitating convenient monitoring and 
management of energy usage from anywhere, at any time. 
Overall, the IoT smart energy meter project presents a cost-
effective and efficient solution for monitoring energy 
consumption, empowering users to make informed decisions 
towards energy conservation and sustainability."
69,Hardware Schemes for Smarter Indoor Robotics to Prevent the Backing Crash Framework Using Field Programmable Gate Array-Based Multi-Robots,"Abstract: The use of smart indoor robotics services is gradually increasing in real-time scenarios. This
paper presents a versatile approach to multi-robot backing crash prevention in indoor environments,
using hardware schemes to achieve greater competence. Here, sensor fusion was initially used to
analyze the state of multi-robots and their orientation within a static or dynamic scenario. The
proposed novel hardware scheme-based framework integrates both static and dynamic scenarios for
the execution of backing crash prevention. A round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm was composed
for the static scenario. Dynamic backing crash prevention was deployed by embedding a first come,
first served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. The behavioral control mechanism of the distributed
multi-robots was integrated with FCFS and adaptive cruise control (ACC) scheduling algorithms. The
integration of multiple algorithms is a challenging task for smarter indoor robotics, and the Xilinx-
based partial reconfiguration method was deployed to avoid computational issues with multiple
algorithms during the run-time. These methods were coded with Verilog HDL and validated using
an FPGA (Zynq)-based multi-robot system."

line on the ground using infrared sensors and SoC’s 
Programmable Logic. The software that interacts with the PL

data is developed using the Processor Subsystem of the SoC."
69,Geometry-Based Parking Assistance Using Sensor Fusion for Robots With Hardware Schemes,"Abstract—Mobile robots parking in indoor environments,
trending
toward
complex
problems,
has
motivated
the
development of new hardware computational paradigms.
In this article, we present a novel and effective research
for addressing parking assistance in slot identification
based on the geometry of a mobile robot using sensor
data fusion with hardware schemes. This article has been
abstracted into three levels. Initially, the geometry of the
mobile robots was analyzed using multisensory fusion at
the gateway and parking slots of the indoor environment.
A heuristic algorithm was developed to analyze the vehicle
geometry patterns. Reconfigurable computing architectures
have been developed for geometry analysis with respect
to measurements of individuals or groups of robots as
leader–follower and rendezvous approaches. The next level
of the proposed algorithm estimates the availability of
parking slots as per mobile robots geometry using a
customized accelerator approach. Mobile robots navigate parking spaces using parking assistance and environmental
maps. Parking assistance is integrated with direction-based path planning, and odometer techniques are embedded in a
known environmental navigation map. A Zynq XC7Z020-CLG484-1 field programmable gate array (FPGA) was deployed
to validate and implemented the design using Xilinx Vivado 2017.4. This article presents essential information for indoor
logistics industries, hospital services, and domestic services."
69,A Versatile Approach to Polygonal Object Avoidance in Indoor Environments with Hardware Schemes Using an FPGA-Based Multi-Robot,"Abstract: Service robots perform versatile functions in indoor environments. This study focuses
on obstacle avoidance using ﬂock-type indoor-based multi-robots. Each robot was developed with
rendezvous behavior and distributed intelligence to perform obstacle avoidance. The hardware
scheme-based obstacle-avoidance algorithm was developed using a bio-inspired ﬂock approach,
which was developed with three stages. Initially, the algorithm estimates polygonal obstacles and their
orientations. The second stage involves performing avoidance at different orientations of obstacles
using a heuristic based Bug2 algorithm. The ﬁnal stage involves performing a ﬂock rendezvous
with distributed approaches and linear movements using a behavioral control mechanism. VLSI
architectures were developed for multi-robot obstacle avoidance algorithms and were coded using
Verilog HDL. The novel design of this article integrates the multi-robot’s obstacle approaches with
behavioral control and hardware scheme-based partial reconﬁguration (PR) ﬂow. The experiments
were validated using FPGA-based multi-robots."
69,A co-operative type of multi-robot parking system with versatile mode and implementation using FPGA,"Abstract
The trending and spotlight research in the ﬁeld of mobile robots in an indoor environment is the parking of autonomous
multi-mobile robots. The proposed research work presents a co-operative, uniﬁed autonomous multi-robot system (MRS)
for parking in the indoor environment. In the research work, initially MRS establishes by themselves a ﬂock using the
behavioral control mechanism and is capable of swapping leadership behavior based on event-driven conditions. The Real
time challenges of MRS ﬂocking in an indoor environment are parking and obstacle avoidance with rendezvous approach.
In this regard, the proposed hardware-based accelerators for MRS ﬂock have been developed using Verilog HDL and
deployed on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to perform obstacle avoidance with rendezvous and parking at
versatile modes. In the process of parking by MRS, the leader evaluates parking slot dimensions and drives the ﬂock
towards the parking. Due to versatile parking modes, the MRS can park in parallel/perpendicular and angular parking. The
proposed approach has been implemented and validated with experiments using Vivado tools and Xilinx FPGA Zynq-7000
SoC ZC702."
69,Design and Implementation of IR Sensor Based FPGA Robot Using Partial Reconfiguration,"Abstract— A hardware core processor is combined with a 
programmable structure on a single device in a reconfigurable 
architecture. The hardware estimators are constructed in a 
reconfigurable structure to enable advanced estimating. At 
runtime, partial reconfiguration (PR) allows for on-the-fly 
changes in functionality while the rest of the logic architecture 
continues to function normally. PR lowers the number of 
logical devices, lowers power consumption, and increases 
system upgradeability. PR hardware design should be divided 
into two techniques in this article. Static logic and 
reconfigurable logic are two types of logic. Static logic behaves 
like a line follower robot, whereas reconfigurable logic 
behaves like a wall follower robot. After then, PR flow controls 
the robot's movement (to follow a line or a wall). When 
snapping in this flow, the robot moves from line to wall 
automatically when snapping mode is enabled. Because of this, 
hardware implementation time can be saved by 90%."
69,Human Gaiting Analysis for Machine Interaction,"Abstract  This paper presents the developments carried 
out in robotic walkers to help elderly, visually impaired, or 
physically disabled people in an environment. Factors like 
human ageing and disabilities have not restricted robotic 
applications in the service sector apart from industrial robot-
ics. Developments in multiple directions came into the world 
frame to make the lives of the needy easier and more com-
fortable without issues. This paper gives relative strategies 
followed by researchers in the development of robotic walk-
ers and control methods based on wearable as well as non-
wearable sensors. It also furnishes the mathematical analysis 
and walker designs to synchronize the behaviour of the robot 
with the human in the process of human–machine interaction 
(HMI). Ultimately, the developments in such service robots 
and the methods used for human interaction are presented 
in this paper."
69,An Automatic Vehicle Speed Controlling based on Traffic Signs Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network,"Abstract: - Autonomous driving systems and applications in the real 
time are the trending field these days. To carry out all the necessary 
operations in accordance with the requirements, these systems do 
require sophisticated algorithms. One of the most challenging 
constraints in performing actions by autonomous driving systems is 
controlling road speed. The novel method proposed for motor 
controlling speed in accordance with speed stipulations uses a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to scan speed limit 
sign boards.  The effectiveness of our system is contingent on CNNs' 
ability to properly recognize and classify objects in images, which 
are then used to extract speed limit information from sign boards.  
The pace of the robot chassis is regulated by an Arduino 
microcontroller using the CNN's output. Through simulations and 
tests on a real testbed, we show how effective our method is and 
show that it can maintain the desired speed with a tolerable degree 
of error."
69,HLS Based Design and Optimization of Merge Sort Algorithm for High Performance Computing,"Abstract—High level synthesis has emerged as a powerful 
tool for designing hardware algorithms for high performance 
computing systems. In this paper, we present an HLS based 
design and optimization of the merge sort algorithm for HPC 
applications. We use Xilinx’s Vivado HLS tool to generate 
hardware description language code from C based descriptions 
of the algorithm, and then optimize the code for throughput 
and latency using HLS directives. Our results demonstrate that 
the optimized merge sort algorithm provides a significant 
improvement in performance over traditional software-based 
implementations. Our work contributes to the growing body of 
research on using HLS for HPC applications. The proposed 
HLS based design and optimized merge sort algorithm shows 
the results like area usage, latency, efficiency, throughput in 
comparison with unoptimized merge sort."
69,An Efficient Image Analysis Approach to Evaluate the Quality of Cotton Seeds,"Abstract—In India, cotton is a significant retail crop. The 
demand for this crop increased as a result of the industry’s 
excessive usage of cotton. India is a significant producer of many 
different cotton goods and exports cotton to several countries. 
The seed directly affects the cotton that is acquired from the 
plant. This seed assures the plant blossoming, and if the seed 
quality is highest, then the crop’s growth is ensured under 
favorable physical conditions. Seed quality can be affirmed 
manually, but it takes longer, is less accurate and is more 
expensive. The image processing technique is used as an 
alternative key in achieving the seed quality analysis in order to 
overcome these limitations and drawbacks. The focus of this 
paper is on the application of image processing techniques for 
evaluating the grade of the captured cottonseeds. The physical 
attributes, such as area and l/b ratio are extracted from the 
captured image with the help of MATLAB. Edge-detected image 
is obtained with the help of FPGA."
69,HEAP-SORT on Dual Port RAM Based FPGA,"Abstract— Often, sorting is a crucial step in the data processing 
process. It is possible to employ software implementations in 
numerous apps that are generally accessible in both paid and 
unpaid versions. But in some high-speed applications, sorting 
should be done in hardware, making use of the possibility of 
parallel processing. The Heapsort is one of the algorithms with the 
best complexity O(n*log(n)). Our approach is based on the 
implementation of the Heapsort algorithm, which makes use of 
dual port random access memory (DP RAM), a hardware feature 
of contemporary Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) 
processors, to implement effective sorting of a data stream. The 
complexity of the sorter is inversely correlated with the sorter 
capacity due to effective use of FPGA resources."
69,Development of Breathe Analysis Technique Using Labview,"Abstract— This paper deals with the analysis of breathe 
signal using LabVIEW. Pranayama is practicing how to 
regulating the breath. It is one of the important components of 
yoga that improves physical and mental wellness. According to 
Sanskrit, Pranayama can be is combination of two words as 
Prama and Yama where “prana” refers to life energy and 
“Yama” indicates control. In this day to day life many are 
practicing Pranayama but most of us don’t know how to do in 
a perfect manner. Improper practice will not lead to proper 
results. In this paper we propose an Analysis of breathe signal 
using LabVIEW for making people practice Pranayama in a 
perfect manner. This helps the practitioner, in controlling their 
breath by following the instructions specified through our 
proposed system. The system has been implemented using 
LabVIEW that helps to execute Text to Speech conversion. 
LabVIEW has inbuilt Speech library to realize the Text to 
Speech transformation. Different strategies and procedures are 
accessible for processing the speech signal. Here, a text box is 
made visible where the instructions are displayed and a timer 
is also made available to observe the amount of time they have 
spent. Heartbeat signals have been captured using an ECG 
sensor which is interfaced with the Arduino Uno board for the 
betterment in the process. Also, we report to show the 
difference in the breathe analysis of the subjects without our 
proposed system and in the presence of our proposed system."
69,ScienceDirect,"Abstract 
In current existences, many techniques have been developed to cast votes. The existing scenario is tremendously aiming towards 
the development of an efficient voting system, which ensures individual authentication and reduces malpractices. It is a challenging 
perspective to recognize each and every individual person casting the vote. The proposed work considers this scenario and 
developed a controller based electronic voting machine using R305 Fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication of every 
individual. The controlled electronic voting machine gives ample scope to cast the votes in simpler manner without minimizing the 
efficient results. The proposed digital Biometric-based EVM is presented in this work. The processed flow for creating this 
biometric based EVM is implemented on FPGA board using Verilog software on Xilinx ISE. The experimental results produce 
efficient verification of unique authentication on selections of political parties.

70,MoCA Domain-Specific Pattern of Cognitive Impairment in Stroke Patients Attending Intensive Inpatient Rehabilitation:A Prospective Study,"Abstract: A domain-specific perspective to cognitive functioning in stroke patients may predict
their cognitive recovery over time and target stroke rehabilitation intervention. However, data
about domain-specific cognitive impairment after stroke are still scarce. This study prospectively
investigated the domain-specific pattern of cognitive impairments, using the classification proposed
by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in a cohort of 49 stroke patients at admission (T0),
discharge (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2) from subacute intensive rehabilitation. The predictive
value of T0 cognitive domains cognitive impairment at T1 and T2 was also investigated. Patients’
cognitive functioning at T0, T1, and T2 was assessed through the MoCA domains for executive
functioning, attention, language, visuospatial, orientation, and memory. Different evolutionary
trends of cognitive domain impairments emerged across time-points. Patients’ impairments in all
domains decreased from T0 to T"

source toolbox that offers advanced analysis capabilities for studying neuronal reflexes and physiological responses to peripheral nerve activ-
ity. Our toolbox leverages the observation of temporal sequences of action potentials within inherently cyclic signals, introducing innovative
methods and indices to enhance analysis accuracy. Importantly, we have designed our computational toolbox to be accessible to novices in
biomedical signal processing. This may include researchers and professionals in healthcare domains, such as clinical medicine, life sciences,
and related fields. By prioritizing user-friendliness, our software application serves as a valuable resource for the scientific community, allow-
ing to extract advanced metrics of neural activity in short time and evaluate their impact on other physiological variables in a consistent and
standardized manner, with the final aim to widen the use of microneurography among researchers and clinicians.

70,Application of a Custom Device to Measure Isometric Knee Strength: Possible Injury Correlation in Professional Soccer (Football) Players,"Abstract: Injury in sports is an occurrence that prevents athletes from participating in training and
competitions and has an incidence of 8.1 injuries/1000 h of practice. This translates into a cost and
also into danger, especially if the event is repeated, for the health of the athlete; the injury certainly has
a multifactorial causality. On the other hand, having instruments that can represent an alarm could
be helpful for those involved in sports science. We used a speciﬁcally designed instrument, presented
in a previous work, which shows excellent reliability and repeatability in measuring the strength
of the knee ﬂexors and extensors to test 107 players belonging to three different teams playing in
the Italian Serie A. We took three measurements, beginning of the season, mid-season, and close
to the end of the season. This retrospective study on 107 professional soccer players demonstrates
that isometric force-related parameters of the knee extensors and ﬂexors are associated with the
risk of injury to lower limbs. Logistic regression evidenced a signiﬁcant correlation between the
parameter indicating the imbalance of the force between the ﬂexors of the two limbs (p ≤0.05,

70,Neural coding of autonomic functions in different states of consciousness,"Abstract 
Detecting signs of residual neural activity in patients with altered states of consciousness is a crucial issue for the cus-
tomization of neurorehabilitation treatments and clinical decision-making. With this large observational prospec-
tive study, we propose an innovative approach to detect residual signs of consciousness via the assessment 
of the amount of autonomic information coded within the brain. The latter was estimated by computing the mutual 
information (MI) between preprocessed EEG and ECG signals, to be then compared across consciousness groups, 
together with the absolute power and an international qualitative labeling. One-hundred seventy-four patients (73 
females, 42%) were included in the study (median age of 65 years [IQR = 20], MCS +: 29, MCS −: 23, UWS: 29). Electro-
encephalography (EEG) information content was found to be mostly related to the coding of electrocardiography 
(ECG) activity, i.e., with higher MI (p < 0.05), in Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome and Minimally Consciousness 
State minus (MCS −). EEG-ECG MI, besides clearly discriminating patients in an MCS − and +, significantly differed 
between lesioned areas (sides) in a subgroup of unilateral hemorrhagic patients. Crucially, such an accessible 
and non-invasive measure of residual consciousness signs was robust across electrodes and patient groups. Conse-
quently, exiting from a strictly neuro-centric consciousness detection approach may be the key to provide comple-
mentary insights for the objective assessment of patients’ consciousness levels and for the patient-specific planning 
of rehabilitative interventions."
70,Estimation of Spatiotemporal Gait Parameters in Walking on a Photoelectric System: Validation on Healthy Children by Standard Gait Analysis,"Abstract: The use of stereophotogrammetry systems is challenging when targeting children’s gait
analysis due to the time required and the need to keep physical markers in place. For this reason,
marker-less photoelectric systems appear to be a solution for accurate and fast gait analysis in youth.
The aim of this study is to validate a photoelectric system and its conﬁgurations (LED ﬁlter setting)
on healthy children, comparing the kinematic gait parameters with those obtained from a three-
dimensional stereophotogrammetry system. Twenty-seven healthy children were enrolled. Three
LED ﬁlter settings for the OptoGait were compared to the BTS P6000. The analysis included the
non-parametric 80% limits of agreement and the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC). Additionally,
normalised limits of agreement and bias (NLoAs and Nbias) were compared to the clinical experience
of physical therapists (i.e., assuming an error lower than 5% is acceptable). ICCs showed excellent
consistency for most of the parameters and ﬁlter settings; NLoAs varied between"
70,Multiplexing Biosensor for the Detection of Extracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers of Tissue Damage and Recovery after Ischemic Stroke,"Abstract: The inﬂammatory, reparative and regenerative mechanisms activated in ischemic stroke
patients immediately after the event cooperate in the response to injury, in the restoration of functions
and in brain remodeling even weeks after the event and can be sustained by the rehabilitation
treatment. Nonetheless, patients’ response to treatments is difﬁcult to predict because of the lack
of speciﬁc measurable markers of recovery, which could be complementary to clinical scales in
the evaluation of patients. Considering that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are carriers of multiple
molecules involved in the response to stroke injury, in the present study, we have identiﬁed a panel
of EV-associated molecules that (i) conﬁrm the crucial involvement of EVs in the processes that
follow ischemic stroke, (ii) could possibly proﬁle ischemic stroke patients at the beginning of the
rehabilitation program, (iii) could be used in predicting patients’ response to treatment. By means
of a multiplexing Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging biosensor, subacute ischemic stroke patients
were proven to have increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
and translocator protein (TSPO) on the surface of small EVs in blood. Besides, microglia EVs and
endothelial EVs were shown to be signiﬁcantly involved in the intercellular communications that
occur more than 10 days after ischemic stroke, thus being potential tools for the proﬁling of patients
in the subacute phase after ischemic stroke and in the prediction of their recovery."

Consciousness
(pDoC) has improved in the last decades. Currently, the
level of consciousness at admission to post-acute rehabili-

prognostic markers. The consciousness disorder diagno-

this work, a multidomain indicator of consciousness based
on CRS-R sub-scales, the Consciousness-Domain-Index

The CDI was computed and internally validated on one
dataset (N=190) and then externally validated on another

70,"Diagnostics  2023 , 13, 507. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13030507 www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics ","Abstract: Background: Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, as cardiac, respiratory and 
electrodermal activity, has been shown to provide specific information on different consciousness 
states. Respiration rates (RRs) are considered indicators of ANS activity and breathing patterns are 
currently already included in the evaluation of patients in critical care. Objective: The aim of this 
work was to derive a proxy of autonomic functions via the RR variability and compare its diagnostic 
capability with known neurophysiological biomarkers of consciousness. Methods: In a cohort of 
sub-acute patients with brain injury during post-acute rehabilitation, polygraphy (ECG, EEG) 
recordings were collected. The EEG was labeled via descriptors based on American Clinical 
Neurophysiology Society terminology and the respiration variability was extracted by computing 
the Approximate Entropy (ApEN) of the ECG-derived respiration signal. Competing logistic 
regressions were applied to evaluate the improvement in model performances introduced by the 
RR ApEN. Results: Higher RR complexity was significantly associated with higher consciousness 
levels and improved diagnostic models’ performances in contrast to the ones built with only 
electroencephalographic descriptors. Conclusions: Adding a quantitative, instrumentally based 
complexity measure of RR variability to multimodal consciousness assessment protocols may 
improve diagnostic accuracy based only on electroencephalographic descriptors. Overall, this study 
promotes the integration of biomarkers derived from the central and the autonomous nervous 
system for the most comprehensive diagnosis of consciousness in a rehabilitation setting."
70,"IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 8, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2023 1045","Abstract—Decoding human motor intentions by processing
electrophysiological signals is a crucial, yet unsolved, challenge
for the development of effective upper limb prostheses. Pattern
recognition of continuous myoelectric (EMG) signals represents
the state-of-art for multi-DoF prosthesis control. However, this
approach relies on the unreliable assumption that repeatable
muscular contractions produce repeatable patterns of steady-state
EMGs. Here, we propose an approach for decoding wrist and hand
movements by processing the signals associated with the onset of
contraction (transient EMG). Speciﬁcally, we extend the concept of

80% of the trials with a median completion time of 26 seconds.
Although the performance proved comparable with earlier studies,
the long completion times suggest that the current controller is
not yet clinically viable. However, taken collectively, our outcomes
reinforce earlier hypothesis that the transient EMG could represent
a viable alternative to steady-state pattern recognition approaches."
70,Looking for Synergies in Healthy Upper Limb Motion: A Focus on the Wrist,"Abstract— Recent studies on human upper limb motion
highlighted the benefit of dimensionality reduction tech-
niques to extrapolate informative joint patterns. These
techniques can simplify the description of upper limb kine-
matics in physiological conditions, serving as a baseline
for the objective assessment of movement alterations, or to
be implemented in a robotic joint. However, the successful
description of kinematic data requires a proper alignment
of the acquisitions to correctly estimate kinematic patterns
and their motion variability. Here, we propose a structured
methodology to process and analyze upper limb kinematic
data, considering time warping and task segmentation to
register task execution on a common normalized comple-
tion time axis. Functional principal component analysis
(fPCA) was used to extract patterns of motion of the wrist
joint from the data collected by healthy participants per-
forming activities of daily living. Our results suggest that
wrist trajectories can be described as a linear combination
of few functional principal components (fPCs). In fact, three
fPCs explained more than 85% of the variance of any
task. Wrist trajectories in the reaching phase of movement
were highly correlated among participants and significantly
more than trajectories in the manipulation phase (p<0.01).
These findings may be useful in simplifying the control and
design of robotic wrists, and could aid the development of
therapies for the early detection of pathological conditions."
70,Can Respiration Complexity Help the Diagnosis of Disorders of Consciousness in Rehabilitation?,"Abstract: Background: Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, as cardiac, respiratory and
electrodermal activity, has been shown to provide speciﬁc information on different consciousness
states. Respiration rates (RRs) are considered indicators of ANS activity and breathing patterns are
currently already included in the evaluation of patients in critical care. Objective: The aim of this
work was to derive a proxy of autonomic functions via the RR variability and compare its diagnostic
capability with known neurophysiological biomarkers of consciousness. Methods: In a cohort of sub-
acute patients with brain injury during post-acute rehabilitation, polygraphy (ECG, EEG) recordings
were collected. The EEG was labeled via descriptors based on American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society terminology and the respiration variability was extracted by computing the Approximate
Entropy (ApEN) of the ECG-derived respiration signal. Competing logistic regressions were applied
to evaluate the improvement in model performances introduced by the RR ApEN. Results: Higher RR
complexity was signiﬁcantly associated with higher consciousness levels and improved diagnostic
models’ performances in contrast to the ones built with only electroencephalographic descriptors.
Conclusions: Adding a quantitative, instrumentally based complexity measure of RR variability to
multimodal consciousness assessment protocols may improve diagnostic accuracy based only on
electroencephalographic descriptors. Overall, this study promotes the integration of biomarkers
derived from the central and the autonomous nervous system for the most comprehensive diagnosis
of consciousness in a rehabilitation setting."
70,Predicting Long-Term Recovery of Consciousness in Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness Based on Coma Recovery Scale-Revised Subscores: Validation of a Machine Learning-Based Prognostic Index,"Abstract: Prognosis of prolonged Disorders of Consciousness (pDoC) is inﬂuenced by patients’
clinical diagnosis and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) total score. We compared the prognostic
accuracy of a novel Consciousness Domain Index (CDI) with that of clinical diagnosis and CRS-R total
score, for recovery of full consciousness at 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-injury. The CDI was obtained
by a combination of the six CRS-R subscales via an unsupervised machine learning technique. We
retrospectively analyzed data on 143 patients with pDoC (75 in Minimally Conscious State; 102 males;
median age = 53 years; IQR = 35; time post-injury = 1–3 months) due to different etiologies enrolled
in an International Brain Injury Association Disorders of Consciousness Special Interest Group (IBIA
DoC-SIG) multicenter longitudinal study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to assess
the association between outcomes and the CDI, compared to clinical diagnosis and CRS-R. The CDI,
the clinical diagnosis, and the CRS-R total score were signiﬁcantly associated with a good outcome at
6, 12 and 24 months. The CDI showed the highest univariate prediction accuracy and sensitivity, and
regression models including the CDI provided the highest values of explained variance. A combined
scoring system of the CRS-R subscales by unsupervised machine learning may improve clinical ability
to predict recovery of consciousness in patients with pDoC."
70,Magnetic-Free Quaternion-Based Robust Unscented Kalman Filter for Upper Limb Kinematic Analysis,"Abstract—Human motion analysis is a ﬁeld of increas-
ing interest. In most applications, an accurate estimation of
joint angles is needed. Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
represent a very promising technology for motion capture.
Unfortunately, their performances are strongly inﬂuenced by
different sources of error (e.g., gyroscopes biases). To limit
the effectof these sourcesof error, several algorithms (usually
deﬁned as “sensor fusion” algorithms) are used. The pro-
posed work aims to validatea magnetic-freequaternion-based
robust unscented Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) for upper limb kinematic
analysis (i.e., estimation of the articular joint angles), using
an inertial body sensor network, in a set of complex 3-D
movements (i.e., the yoga poses). The algorithm was tested on
ten expert yoga practitioners during the execution of the sun
salutation sequence. Joint angle estimations were compared
with the ones obtained from an optoelectronic reference system by evaluating the root mean square errors (RMSEs) and
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients. The achieved worst case was 8.41◦, while the best one was 2.96◦for RMSEs mean
values. The accuracy of the algorithm was further conﬁrmed by the high values of Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients
(lowest mean value of 0.80). In addition, the comparison with one of the most used ﬁlters for attitude estimation [extended
Kalman ﬁlter (EKF)] showed no signiﬁcant differences between the two methods. Up to authors knowledge, the scientiﬁc
literature lacks the development of a complete magnetic-free version of the UKF for human motion capture and analysis
in complex movements, such as the one introduced here. The proposed work aims at ﬁlling this gap."
70,Extra-Linguistic Cognitive Functions Involved in the Token Test: Results from a Cohort of Non-Aphasic Stroke Patients with Right Hemisphere Lesion,"Abstract: Background: The Token Test (TT) is widely used to examine comprehension disorders
in aphasic patients, but abilities other than language may affect a patient’s performance. This
study aims to explore the correlation between the TT subtest performances and the performances in
extra-linguistic cognitive areas in a cohort of patients from the Intensive Rehabilitation Post-Stroke
(RIPS) study with a ﬁrst, right hemisphere stroke and without aphasia, prospectively enrolled at
admission to intensive inpatient post-acute rehabilitation. Methods: The patients were administered
the TT (50-item version), the forward and backward digit span (DST), and the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA). Spearman’s partial correlations adjusted by age were used to evaluate the
association between the number of errors in the TT and the other tests’ corrected scores. Results: Of
the 37 patients enrolled in this study, 29.7% made 3–11 errors on the TT, 27.0% more than 11 errors,
mostly in parts IV and V. The forward and backward digit span scores showed correlations with
errors in part V of the TT (r = −0.408, p = 0.013; r = −0.307, p = 0.027). The errors in part IV of the TT
presented a correlation with a forward digit span too (r = −0.394, p = 0.017). With respect to MoCA
domains, executive functioning, and orientation were related to the TT part V errors (r = −0.468,
p = 0.007; r = −0.499, p = 0.003). The orientation also correlated with the TT part III (r = −0.504,
p = 0.002). Conclusion: Our ﬁndings show that the TT performances in patients with right hemisphere
stroke and without aphasia are related to impairments in auditory–verbal span/auditory working
memory mostly for TT scores on subpart V as measured by the DST and to executive function and
orientation, as measured by the MoCA subtests."
70,EEG-based methods for recovery prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness: A systematic review,"abstracts, followed by the full texts. A
fourth reviewer (AM) was involved if a disagreement occurred.
During this phase, only papers in English were considered eligible
for screening. The selection concerning outcomes was not applied
during the search phase; it was performed in the screening phase
only.
Moreover, studies included by other reviews close to our topic
were analysed (Bai et al., 2020; Wutzl et al., 2021), through which
three additional papers were included (Bai et al., 2019; Bareham
et al., 2020; Formisano et al., 2019b).
2.3. Data collection
For the data collection, the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and
data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling
Studies (CHARMS) was used (Moons et al., 2014). The following
data were extracted from the included studies:
- Source of data (authors’ names and year of publication);
- Participant characteristics (age, number, consciousness stratiﬁ-
cation, aetiology, time from event, and presence of epilepsy);
- Setting (monocentric or multicentric, number of electrodes,
sampling frequency, and signal duration);
- Study design (randomised controlled trial [RCT] or non-RCT);
- Stimuli (auditory, visual, electric, tactile, transcranial direct cur-
rent stimulation [tDCS], transcranial magnetic stimulation
[TMS], and others);
- Methods (preprocessing ﬁlters and segmentation parameters,
analysed domain, model type, model performances, and fre-
quency band);
- Features (measures used to quantify an independent variable);
- Outcomes (measures used to evaluate a dependent variable and
its timing).
2.4. Data synthesis
Only the content of papers that fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria
was used for the analyses. The results were displayed through nar-
rative data synthesis since, due to the heterogeneity of the meth-
ods
in
the
extraction
pipelines,
a
meta-analysis
was
not
applicable. For the same reason, the use of the PROBAST tool to
evaluate the methodological quality of prognostic studies was
not possible (Wolff et al., 2019).
Moreover, a PICO format was generally used to display the
results. First, a general description of the participants included in
the studies and the experimental setting was provided. Then, the
intervention types were displayed following the consecutive steps
of the analysis pipeline, namely the EEG signal preprocessing meth-
ods, the domain analysis performed (time, frequency, or both), the
EEG features extracted, and the data analysis used to identify candi-
date prognostic factors (Fig. 1). Lastly, a brief paragraph was dedi-
cated to the description of the outcomes. In line with the deﬁnition
of the string and selection criteria, the PICO component of ‘Com-
parison’ was not addressed in the results.
Regarding features, the results were presented distinguishing
between qualitative and quantitative features. In the case of the lat-
ter, additional categorisation was conducted as follows: evoked
potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs), spectral mea-
sures, entropy measures, and graph-theory measures.
2.5. Data availability
Data were extensively included within the manuscript and Sup-
plementary Material. However, a comprehensive version of the
data set with the data extracted from the included papers can be
obtained for research purposes by submitting a request to the cor-
responding author.

70,The Impact of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy on Functional Outcome of Patients Affected by Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage Discharged from Intensive Inpatient Rehabilitation: A Cohort Study,"Abstract: Background: Sporadic CAA is recognized as a major cause of sICH and sABI. Even if
intensive rehabilitation is recommended to maximize functional recovery after sICH, no data are
available on whether CAA may affect rehabilitation outcomes. In this observational prospective
study, to explore the impact of CAA on rehabilitation results, functional outcomes after intensive
rehabilitation have been compared between patients affected by sICH with and without a diagnosis
of CAA. Methods: All adults affected by sABI due to sICH and admitted to the IRU of IRCCS-Don-
Gnocchi-Foundation were consecutively enrolled for 12 months. Demographic and clinical data were
recorded upon admission and discharge. Results: Among 102 sICH patients (age: 66 (IQR = 16),
53% female), 13% were diagnosed as probable/possible-CAA. TPO and functional assessment were
comparable upon admission, but CAA patients were signiﬁcantly older (p = 0.001). After a comparable
LOS, CAA patients presented higher care burden (ERBI: p = 0.025), poorer functional recovery (FIM:
p = 0.02) and lower levels of global independence (GOSE > 4: p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, CAA
was signiﬁcantly correlated with a lower FIM (p = 0.019) and a lower likelihood of reaching GOS-E > 4,
(p = 0.041) at discharge, independently from age. Conclusions: CAA seems to be independently
associated with poorer rehabilitation outcomes, suggesting the importance of improving knowledge
about CAA to better predict rehabilitation outcomes."

inorganic perovskite memristor on the flexible PET substrate. The 
device shows excellent resistive switching performance with the 
SET voltage of 0.45 V, the RESET voltage of -0.28 V, and ON/OFF 
ratio of 610. Furthermore, we have performed temperature 
dependent deep level transient spectroscopy measurements to 
study the origin of ion migration in our perovskite layer. Our 
measurements indicate the presence of methyl ammonium 
vacancies V-MA.  The measured activation energy of V-MA (0.48 eV) 
is low enough to have an impact on the filament formation, and 
thus, the memristive behaviour of the device.

71,Investigation of lead-free 2D/3D mixed-dimensional tin perovskite solar cell embedded with plasmonic metal nanoparticles,"Abstract—In this work, various metal nanoparticles have been
used to improve the efﬁciency of a single layer 2D/3D mixed-
dimensional hybrid tin perovskite solar cell, exploiting the surface
plasmon effect. Silvaco TCAD and Lumerical FDTD software
have been used for this study. As a ﬁrst step, the thickness
of perovskite layer, without the presence of any nanoparticles,
has been optimized using experimentally determined optical
constants. It has been found that the best possible efﬁciency of
14.13% is obtained at 180 nm. At this thickness, the size and
position of metal nanoparticles in the perovskite layer have been
varied. With spherical silver nanoparticles of 15 nm radius placed
at the electron transport layer interface, the light absorption
has been signiﬁcantly enhanced for wavelengths between 450-
600 nm and above 800 nm. Owing to this, the maximum possible
photocurrent density improved by 7% to 29.64 mA.cm-2."
71,Effect of active layer thickness and angle of incidence on the efficiency of planar heterojunction lead-free tin perovskite solar cell,"Abstract—In this paper, lead-free tin perovskite solar cell has
been investigated using 2D-Sentaurus TCAD simulation. A planar
structure consisting of PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer,
FASnI3 as the absorber layer and PCBM as the electron transport
layer has been simulated. Using the physics-based optical transfer
matrix and drift-diffusion models, the effect of thicknesses of the
absorber layer and angle of incidence have been investigated. The
results show that in order to achieve the best efﬁciency,at normal
incidence, thickness of FASnI3 absorber layer should be 120 nm
thick. In addition, the angle of incidence of the AM"

based on low-temperature solution-processable semicon-
ductors such as organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites
(OIHPs), kesterites, and polymers have been analyzed
optically using the transfer matrix method (TMM). Various
active-layer combinations for top and bottom sub-cells
have been compared with respect to the maximum possible
photocurrent density, parasitic absorption loss, reﬂection
loss, and spectral overlap loss. The choice of materials was
such that either their band gaps are close to ideal values or
highest efﬁciency devices were reported using them. In the
initial step for device optimization, the thickness of non-
active layer has been optimized to maximize the absorption
in the low bandgap sub-cell. Subsequently, thicknesses
of both the active layers were simultaneously varied to
maximize and match the photocurrent densities (JPH|Max) in
two sub-cells. Within the several combinations optimized,
we found that polymer - tin OIHP and all-polymer TSCs
were the most promising ones, with JPH|Max values of 15.566
and 15.232 mA.cm-2 respectively. While the former had the
lowest reﬂection loss ("
71,Effect of Antisolvent Method on the Performance of HOIP based Memristive Devices,"Abstract— This paper presents a hybrid organic inorganic 
perovskite based memristive device having a structure that is 
commonly used for solar cells. Toluene is used as antisolvent 
during perovskite layer coating and its effect on the memristive 
device performance is studied in this report. It has been found 
that the antisolvent improves the morphology of the perovskite 
film. With this method, we obtained non-reversible resistive 
switching in the device with an on/off ratio of 104. This device 
also shows a reversible resistance switching with a set voltage 
of 0.5 V and a reset voltage of -0.9 V, measured at a sweep rate 
of 1 mV/s. The fabricated memory device shows promising 
performance and could be used as a non-volatile memory 
device for low power consuming applications."
71,Role of single walled carbon nanotubes in improving the efficiency of P3HT:PCBM solar cells - impedance spectroscopy and morphology studies,"ABSTRACT 
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells of P3HT:PCBM 
doped with SWNTs were fabricated which doubled the 
efficiency 
over 
the 
undoped 
devices. No 
surface 
modifications of SWNTs were done during fabrication. 
Absorption and photoluminescence spectra along with 
photocurrent and spectral response of the devices show 
that SWNTs do not result in any significant charge 
generation at the P3HT:SWNT interface indicating that 
possible type-II heterojunctions between s-SWNTs and 
P3HT were dominated by the effects due to metallic tubes. 
At an optimum concentration of 0.75 wt% SWNTs, a 10% 
improvement in effective mobility was observed. In the 
voltage range of solar cell operation, two orders increase 
in injected current density is observed which has an Ohmic 
behavior. From the peak voltage of the capacitance-
voltage characteristics, it was inferred that SWNTs reduce 
the Vbi of the devices by only 60 mV. From the Cole-Cole 
in the diffusion transport regime, it was observed that the 
injected carrier life time gets lowered from 0.628 ms to 
0.125 ms with SWNTs. A negative capacitance was 
observed in reverse bias in devices with SWNTs at low 
frequencies which has similar dependence on applied field 
as that in forward bias. This is attributed to the large 
reverse current injected through SWNT energy levels, 
making the effects of space charge, trapping, and 
recombination significant. The surface roughness and 
volume were more than doubled with SWNTs which 
resulted in increased cathode coverage area affecting the 
charge collection efficiency. Charge extraction efficiency is 
analyzed using the photocurrent loss normalized to the 
dark current where two orders of magnitude improvement 
is observed with SWNTs."
71,Enhanced performance of poly-3(hexylthiophene) - single walled carbon nanotube bulk heterojunction solar cells using a poly-3(hexylthiophene) buffer layer and Ca electrode,"ABSTRACT 
An enhancement in the performance of P3HT:SWNT 
bulk heterojunction solar cell was achieved by using a 
buffer layer of P3HT between the anode and the bulk 
layer. The buffer layer improved the shunt resistance of 
the device (1 wt% SWNT) from 25 kΩ to 400 kΩ. This 
resulted in the increase of open circuit voltage from 0.06 V 
to 0.45 V. Because of the increased thickness, the light 
absorbed by the device increased resulting in the short 
circuit current density, Jsc, to improve from 2.54 µA cm-2 to 
13.25 µA cm-2. Variation of SWNT content in P3HT 
showed that the optimum concentration of SWNTs is near 
0.25 wt% which gave the highest open circuit voltage, Voc, 
of 0.53 V. Dark characteristics of these devices show a 
ohmic behavior at low voltages indicating that addition of 
SWNTs resulted in increased residual charges. Reverse 
photocurrent of the devices is found to increase 
considerably with higher concentration of SWNTs. 
Spectral response of the devices show that SWNTs do not 
contribute to generation of photocurrent. Thus, we 
conclude that SWNTs help only in charge transport in 
P3HT devices. Use of Ca cathode increased Jsc to 16.4 µA 
cm-2 and Voc to 0.65 V because of the higher built-in field."
72,Bridging language to visuals: towards natural language query-to-chart image retrieval,"Abstract
Given a natural language query, mining a relevant chart image, i.e., the one that contains the answer to the query, is an
overlooked problem in the literature. Our study explores this novel problem. Consider an example of retrieving relevant chart
images for a query: Which Indian city has the highest annual rainfall over the past decade?. Retrieving relevant chart images for
such natural language queries necessitates a deep semantic understanding of chart images. Towards addressing this problem,
in this work, we make two key contributions: (a) We present a dataset, namely WebCIRD (or Web Chart Image Retrieval)
for studying this problem, and (b) propose a solution viz. ChartSemBERT that offers a deeper semantic understanding of
chart images for effective natural language-to-chart image retrieval. Our proposed approach yields remarkable performance
improvements compared to the existing baselines, achieving R@10 as 86.9%."
72,Sketch-guided Image Inpainting with Partial Discrete Diffusion Process,"Abstract
In this work, we study the task of sketch-guided image in-
painting. Unlike the well-explored natural language-guided
image inpainting, which excels in capturing semantic de-
tails, the relatively less-studied sketch-guided inpainting of-
fers greater user control in specifying the object’s shape
and pose to be inpainted. As one of the early solutions to
this task, we introduce a novel partial discrete diffusion pro-
cess (PDDP). The forward pass of the PDDP corrupts the
masked regions of the image and the backward pass recon-
structs these masked regions conditioned on hand-drawn
sketches using our proposed sketch-guided bi-directional
transformer. The proposed novel transformer module ac-
cepts two inputs – the image containing the masked region
to be inpainted and the query sketch to model the reverse
diffusion process. This strategy effectively addresses the do-
main gap between sketches and natural images, thereby, en-
hancing the quality of inpainting results. In the absence of
a large-scale dataset specific to this task, we synthesize a
dataset from the MS-COCO to train and extensively eval-
uate our proposed framework against various competent
approaches in the literature. The qualitative and quanti-
tative results and user studies establish that the proposed
method inpaints realistic objects that fit the context in terms
of the visual appearance of the provided sketch.

further research, we have made our code publicly avail-
able here: https://github.com/vl2g/Sketch-

72,Composite Sketch+Text Queries for Retrieving Objects with Elusive Names and Complex Interactions,"Abstract
Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle
to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them,
e.g., people outside Australia searching for ‘numbats.’ Fur-
ther, users may want to search for such elusive objects with
difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., “numbat digging in the
ground.” In such common but complex situations, users desire
a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries
comprising hand-drawn sketches of “difficult-to-name but
easy-to-draw” objects and text describing “difficult-to-sketch
but easy-to-verbalize” object’s attributes or interaction with
the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs
from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based im-
age retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) prob-
lems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset,
CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval),
consisting of ∼2M queries and 108K natural scene im-
ages. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a
pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET
(Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to lo-
calize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and en-
codes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In ad-
dition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training
objectives that improve the performance of our model. Exten-
sive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms
several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-
only, and composite query modalities. We make the dataset
and code available at: https://vl2g.github.io/projects/cstbir."
72,QDETRv: Query-Guided DETR for One-Shot Object Localization in Videos,"Abstract
In this work, we study one-shot video object localization
problem that aims to localize instances of unseen objects in
the target video using a single query image of the object. To-
ward addressing this challenging problem, we extend a pop-
ular and successful object detection method, namely DETR
(Detection Transformer), and introduce a novel approach –
query-guided detection transformer for videos (QDETRv). A
distinctive feature of QDETRv is its capacity to exploit in-
formation from the query image and spatio-temporal con-
text of the target video, which significantly aids in precisely
pinpointing the desired object in the video. We incorporate
cross-attention mechanisms that capture temporal relation-
ships across adjacent frames to handle the dynamic context
in videos effectively. Further, to ensure strong initialization
for QDETRv, we also introduce a novel unsupervised pre-
training technique tailored to videos. This involves training
our model on synthetic object trajectories with an analogous
objective as the query-guided localization task. During this
pretraining phase, we incorporate recurrent object queries
and loss functions that encourage accurate patch feature re-
construction. These additions enable better temporal under-
standing and robust representation learning. Our experiments
show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the
competitive baselines on two public benchmarks, VidOR and
ImageNet-VidVRD, extended for one-shot open-set localiza-
tion tasks."
72,Multimedia Tools and Applications (2024) 83:14857–14881,"Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using hand-drawn sketches of objects
as queries for one-shot object localization. However, hand-drawn crude sketches alone can
be ambiguous for object localization, which could result in misidentiﬁcation, e.g., a sketch
of a laptop could be confused for a sofa. To overcome this, we propose a novel multimodal
approach to object localization that combines sketch queries with linguistic category deﬁni-
tions, allowing for a better representation of visual and semantic cues. Our approach employs
a cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal network to obtain relevant
proposals. Further, we propose an orthogonal projection-based proposal scoring technique
that effectively ranks proposals with respect to the query. We evaluated our method using
hand-drawn sketches from the ‘Quick, Draw!’ dataset and glosses from ‘WordNet’ as queries

72,Semantic Labels-Aware Transformer Model for Searching Over a Large Collection of Lecture-Slides,"Abstract
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enable easy
access to many educational materials, particularly lecture
slides, on the web. Searching through them based on user
queries becomes an essential problem due to the availability
of such vast information. To address this, we present Lec-
ture Slide Deck Search Engine – a model that supports nat-
ural language queries and hand-drawn sketches and per-
forms searches on a large collection of slide images on com-
puter science topics. This search engine is trained using a
novel semantic label-aware transformer model that extracts
the semantic labels in the slide images and seamlessly en-
codes them with the visual cues from the slide images and
textual cues from the natural language query. Further, to
study the problem in a challenging setting, we introduce
a novel dataset, namely the Lecture Slide Deck (LecSD)
Dataset containing 54K slide images from the Data Struc-
ture, Computer Networks, and Optimization courses and
provide associated manual annotation for the query in the
form of natural language or hand-drawn sketch. The pro-
posed Lecture Slide Deck Search Engine outperforms the
competitive baselines and achieves nearly 4% superior Re-
call@1 on an absolute scale compared to the state-of-the-
art approach. We firmly believe that this work will open up
promising directions for improving the accessibility and us-
ability of educational resources, enabling students and edu-
cators to find and utilize lecture materials more effectively."
72,Query-Guided Attention in Vision Transformers for Localizing Objects Using a Single Sketch,"Abstract
In this study, we explore sketch-based object localiza-
tion on natural images. Given a crude hand-drawn object
sketch, the task is to locate all instances of that object in the
target image. This problem proves difficult due to the ab-
stract nature of hand-drawn sketches, variations in the style
and quality of sketches, and the large domain gap between
the sketches and the natural images. Existing solutions ad-
dress this using attention-based frameworks to merge query
information into image features. Yet, these methods often
integrate query features after independently learning im-
age features, causing inadequate alignment and as a re-
sult incorrect localization. In contrast, we propose a novel
sketch-guided vision transformer encoder that uses cross-
attention after each block of the transformer-based image
encoder to learn query-conditioned image features, lead-
ing to stronger alignment with the query sketch. Further,
at the decoder’s output, object and sketch features are re-
fined better to align the representation of objects with the
sketch query, thereby improving localization. The proposed
model also generalizes to the object categories not seen dur-
ing training, as the target image features learned by the
proposed model are query-aware. Our framework can uti-
lize multiple sketch queries via a trainable novel sketch fu-
sion strategy. The model is evaluated on the images from
the public benchmark, MS-COCO, using the sketch queries
from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets. Compared with ex-
isting localization methods, the proposed approach gives a
6.6% and 8.0% improvement in mAP for seen objects using
sketch queries from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets, re-
spectively, and a 12.2% improvement in AP@50 for large
objects that are ‘unseen’ during training. The code is avail-
able at https://vcl-iisc.github.io/locformer/."
72,Show Me the World in My Language:,"Abstract. In this work, we study the task of “visually” translating
scene text from a source language (e.g., Hindi) to a target language
(e.g., English). Visual translation involves not just the recognition and
translation of scene text but also the generation of the translated im-
age that preserves visual features of the source scene text, such as font,
size, and background. There are several challenges associated with this
task, such as translation with limited context, deciding between trans-
lation and transliteration, accommodating varying text lengths within
fixed spatial boundaries, and preserving the font and background styles
of the source scene text in the target language. To address this prob-
lem, we make the following contributions: (i) We study visual trans-
lation as a standalone problem for the first time in the literature. (ii)
We present a cascaded framework for visual translation that combines
state-of-the-art modules for scene text recognition, machine translation,
and scene text synthesis as a baseline for the task. (iii) We propose
a set of task-specific design enhancements to design a variant of the
baseline to obtain performance improvements. (iv) Currently, the ex-
isting related literature lacks any comprehensive performance evalua-
tion for this novel task. To fill this gap, we introduce several automatic
and user-assisted evaluation metrics designed explicitly for evaluating
visual translation. Further, we evaluate presented baselines for translat-
ing scene text between Hindi and English. Our experiments demonstrate
that although we can effectively perform visual translation over a large
collection of scene text images, the presented baseline only partially ad-
dresses challenges posed by visual translation tasks. We firmly believe
that this new task and the limitations of existing models, as reported
in this paper, should encourage further research in visual translation.
We have publicly released the code and dataset on our project website:

72,Answer Mining from a Pool of Images: Towards,"Abstract
We study visual question answering in a setting
where the answer has to be mined from a pool
of relevant and irrelevant images given as a con-
text.
For such a setting, a model must first re-
trieve relevant images from the pool and answer
the question from these retrieved images. We refer
to this problem as retrieval-based visual question
answering (or RETVQA in short). The RETVQA
is distinctively different and more challenging than
the traditionally-studied Visual Question Answer-
ing (VQA), where a given question has to be an-
swered with a single relevant image in context. To-
wards solving the RETVQA task, we propose a
unified Multi Image BART (MI-BART) that takes a
question and retrieved images using our relevance
encoder for free-form fluent answer generation.
Further, we introduce the largest dataset in this
space, namely RETVQA, which has the following
salient features: multi-image and retrieval require-
ment for VQA, metadata-independent questions
over a pool of heterogeneous images, expecting a
mix of classification-oriented and open-ended gen-
erative answers. Our proposed framework achieves
an accuracy of 76.5% and a fluency of 79.3% on
the proposed dataset, namely RETVQA and also
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.9% and

72,Few-Shot Referring Relationships in Videos,"Abstract
Interpreting visual relationships is a core aspect of com-
prehensive video understanding. Given a query visual re-
lationship as <subject, predicate, object> and a test video,
our objective is to localize the subject and object that are
connected via the predicate. Given modern visio-lingual
understanding capabilities, solving this problem is achiev-
able, provided that there are large-scale annotated training
examples available. However, annotating for every combi-
nation of subject, object, and predicate is cumbersome, ex-
pensive, and possibly infeasible. Therefore, there is a need
for models that can learn to spatially and temporally lo-
calize subjects and objects that are connected via an un-
seen predicate using only a few support set videos shar-
ing the common predicate.
We address this challenging
problem, referred to as few-shot referring relationships in
videos for the first time. To this end, we pose the problem
as a minimization of an objective function defined over a
T-partite random field. Here, the vertices of the random
field correspond to candidate bounding boxes for the sub-
ject and object, and T represents the number of frames in
the test video. This objective function is composed of frame-
level and visual relationship similarity potentials. To learn
these potentials, we use a relation network that takes query-
conditioned translational relationship embedding as inputs
and is meta-trained using support set videos in an episodic
manner. Further, the objective function is minimized using

a belief propagation-based message passing on the random
field to obtain the spatiotemporal localization or subject
and object trajectories. We perform extensive experiments
using two public benchmarks, namely ImageNet-VidVRD
and VidOR, and compare the proposed approach with com-
petitive baselines to assess its efficacy."
72,Grounding Scene Graphs on Natural Images via Visio-Lingual Message Passing,"Abstract
This paper presents a framework for jointly grounding
objects that follow certain semantic relationship constraints
given in a scene graph. A typical natural scene contains
several objects, often exhibiting visual relationships of var-
ied complexities between them.
These inter-object rela-
tionships provide strong contextual cues towards improv-
ing grounding performance compared to a traditional ob-
ject query-only-based localization task. A scene graph is
an efficient and structured way to represent all the objects
and their semantic relationships in the image. In an attempt
towards bridging these two modalities representing scenes
and utilizing contextual information for improving object
localization, we rigorously study the problem of grounding
scene graphs on natural images. To this end, we propose
a novel graph neural network-based approach referred to
as Visio-Lingual Message PAssing Graph Neural Network
(VL-MPAG Net). In VL-MPAG Net, we first construct a di-
rected graph with object proposals as nodes and an edge
between a pair of nodes representing a plausible relation
between them.
Then a three-step inter-graph and intra-
graph message passing is performed to learn the context-
dependent representation of the proposals and query ob-
jects. These object representations are used to score the
proposals to generate object localization.
The proposed
method significantly outperforms the baselines on four pub-
lic datasets."
72,Contrastive Multi-View Textual-Visual Encoding: Towards One Hundred Thousand-Scale One-Shot Logo Identification,"ABSTRACT
In this paper, we study the problem of identifying logos of busi-
ness brands in natural scenes in an open-set one-shot setting. This
problem setup is significantly more challenging than traditionally-
studied ‘closed-set’ and ‘large-scale training samples per category’
logo recognition settings. We propose a novel multi-view textual-
visual encoding framework that encodes text appearing in the logos
as well as the graphical design of the logos to learn robust con-
trastive representations. These representations are jointly learned
for multiple views of logos over a batch and thereby they general-
ize well to unseen logos. We evaluate our proposed framework for
cropped logo verification, cropped logo identification, and end-to-
end logo identification in natural scene tasks; and compare it against
state-of-the-art methods. Further, the literature lacks a ‘very-large-
scale’ collection of reference logo images that can facilitate the
study of one-hundred thousand-scale logo identification. To fill this
gap in the literature, we introduce Wikidata Reference Logo Dataset
(WiRLD), containing logos for 100K business brands harvested from
Wikidata. Our proposed framework that achieves an area under

72,"Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing , pages 9936–9949","Abstract
Table-to-text generation has been widely stud-
ied in the Natural Language Processing com-
munity in the recent years. We give a new
perspective to this problem by incorporating
signals from both tables as well as associated
images to generate relevant text. While tables
contain a structured list of facts, images are a
rich source of unstructured visual information.
For example, in the tourism domain, images
can be used to infer knowledge such as the type
of landmark (e.g., church), its architecture (e.g.,
Ancient Roman), and composition (e.g., white
marble). Therefore, in this paper, we introduce
the novel task of Vision-augmented Table-To-
Text Generation (VISTOT), defined as follows:
given a table and an associated image, produce
a descriptive sentence conditioned on the mul-
timodal input. For the task, we present a novel
multimodal table-to-text dataset, WIKILAND-
MARKS, covering 73,084 unique world land-
marks. Further, we also present a competitive
architecture, namely, VT3 that generates accu-
rate sentences conditioned on the image and
table pairs. Through extensive analyses and
experiments, we show that visual cues from im-
ages are helpful in (i) inferring missing informa-
tion from incomplete or sparse tables, and (ii)
strengthening the importance of useful infor-
mation from noisy tables for natural language
generation. We make the code and data pub-
licly available"
72,COFAR: Commonsense and Factual Reasoning in Image Search,"Abstract
One characteristic that makes humans su-
perior to modern artiﬁcially intelligent mod-
els is the ability to interpret images beyond
what is visually apparent.
Consider the fol-
lowing two natural language search queries
– (i) “a queue of customers patiently wait-
ing to buy ice cream"" and (ii) “a queue of
tourists going to see a famous Mughal archi-
tecture in India."" Interpreting these queries re-
quires one to reason with (i) Commonsense
such as interpreting people as customers or
tourists, actions as waiting to buy or going
to see; and (ii) Fact or world knowledge as-
sociated with named visual entities, for ex-
ample, whether the store in the image sells
ice cream or whether the landmark in the im-
age is a Mughal architecture located in In-
dia. Such reasoning goes beyond just visual
recognition.
To enable both commonsense
and factual reasoning in the image search, we

present a uniﬁed framework, namely Knowl-
edge Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Trans-
former (KRAMT), that treats the named vi-
sual entities in an image as a gateway to ency-
clopedic knowledge and leverages them along
with natural language query to ground relevant
knowledge. Further, KRAMT seamlessly in-
tegrates visual content and grounded knowl-
edge to learn alignment between images and
search queries. This uniﬁed framework is then
used to perform image search requiring com-
monsense and factual reasoning. The retrieval
performance of KRAMT is evaluated and com-
pared with related approaches on a new dataset
we introduce – namely COFAR. We make

72,Few-Shot Visual Relationship Co-Localization,"Abstract
In this paper, given a small bag of images, each contain-
ing a common but latent predicate, we are interested in lo-
calizing visual subject-object pairs connected via the com-
mon predicate in each of the images. We refer to this novel
problem as visual relationship co-localization or VRC as an
abbreviation. VRC is a challenging task, even more so than
the well-studied object co-localization task. This becomes
further challenging when using just a few images, the model
has to learn to co-localize visual subject-object pairs con-
nected via unseen predicates. To solve VRC, we propose an
optimization framework to select a common visual relation-
ship in each image of the bag. The goal of the optimization
framework is to find the optimal solution by learning visual
relationship similarity across images in a few-shot setting.
To obtain robust visual relationship representation, we uti-
lize a simple yet effective technique that learns relationship
embedding as a translation vector from visual subject to vi-
sual object in a shared space. Further, to learn visual rela-
tionship similarity, we utilize a proven meta-learning tech-
nique commonly used for few-shot classification tasks. Fi-
nally, to tackle the combinatorial complexity challenge aris-
ing from an exponential number of feasible solutions, we
use a greedy approximation inference algorithm that selects
approximately the best solution.
We extensively evaluate our proposed framework on
variations of bag sizes obtained from two challenging pub-
lic datasets, namely VrR-VG and VG-150, and achieve im-
pressive visual co-localization performance."
72,DHFML: deep heterogeneous feature metric learning for matching photograph and cartoon pairs,"Abstract
We study the problem of retrieving cartoon faces of celebrities given their real face as a query. We refer to this problem
as Photo2Cartoon. The Photo2Cartoon problem is challenging since (i) cartoons vary excessively in style and (ii) modality
gap between real and cartoon faces is large. To address these challenges, we present a discriminative deep metric learning
approach designed for matching cross-modal faces and showcase Photo2Cartoon. The proposed approach learns a nonlinear
transformation to project real and cartoon face pairs into a common subspace where distance between positive pairs becomes
smaller as compared to distance between negative pairs. We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks, namely IIIT-CFW
and Viewed Sketch, and show superior retrieval results as compared to related methods."
72,KVQA: Knowlege-Aware Visual Question Answering,"Abstract
Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as an impor-
tant problem spanning Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). In conventional
VQA, one may ask questions about an image which can be
answered purely based on its content. For example, given
an image with people in it, a typical VQA question may
inquire about the number of people in the image. More re-
cently, there is growing interest in answering questions which
require commonsense knowledge involving common nouns
(e.g., cats, dogs, microphones) present in the image. In spite
of this progress, the important problem of answering ques-
tions requiring world knowledge about named entities (e.g.,
Barack Obama, White House, United Nations) in the image
has not been addressed in prior research. We address this
gap in this paper, and introduce KVQA – the ﬁrst dataset
for the task of (world) knowledge-aware VQA. KVQA con-
sists of 183K question-answer pairs involving more than 18K
named entities and 24K images. Questions in this dataset
require multi-entity, multi-relation, and multi-hop reasoning
over large Knowledge Graphs (KG) to arrive at an answer. To
the best of our knowledge, KVQA is the largest dataset for
exploring VQA over KG. Further, we also provide baseline
performances using state-of-the-art methods on KVQA."
72,From Strings to Things: Knowledge-Enabled VQA Model That Can Read and Reason,"Abstract
Text present in images are not merely strings, they pro-
vide useful cues about the image. Despite their utility in
better image understanding, scene texts are not used in tra-
ditional visual question answering (VQA) models. In this
work, we present a VQA model which can read scene texts
and perform reasoning on a knowledge graph to arrive at
an accurate answer. Our proposed model has three mutu-
ally interacting modules: (i) proposal module to get word
and visual content proposals from the image, (ii) fusion
module to fuse these proposals, question and knowledge
base to mine relevant facts, and represent these facts as
multi-relational graph, (iii) reasoning module to perform a
novel gated graph neural network based reasoning on this
graph.
The performance of our knowledge-enabled VQA model
is evaluated on our newly introduced dataset, viz.
text-
KVQA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst dataset
which identiﬁes the need for bridging text recognition with
knowledge graph based reasoning. Through extensive ex-
periments, we show that our proposed method outperforms
traditional VQA as well as question-answering over knowl-
edge base-based methods on text-KVQA."
72,OCR-VQA: Visual Question Answering by Reading Text in Images,"Abstract—The problem of answering questions about an
image is popularly known as visual question answering (or
VQA in short). It is a well-established problem in computer
vision. However, none of the VQA methods currently utilize the
text often present in the image. These “texts in images” provide
additional useful cues and facilitate better understanding of
the visual content. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of
visual question answering by reading text in images, i.e., by
optical character recognition or OCR. We refer to this problem
as OCR-VQA. To facilitate a systematic way of studying this
new problem, we introduce a large-scale dataset, namely OCR-
VQA–200K. This dataset comprises of 207,572 images of book
covers and contains more than 1 million question-answer pairs
about these images. We judiciously combine well-established
techniques from OCR and VQA domains to present a novel
baseline for OCR-VQA–200K. The experimental results and
rigorous analysis demonstrate various challenges present in
this dataset leaving ample scope for the future research. We are
optimistic that this new task along with compiled dataset will
open-up many exciting research avenues both for the document
image analysis and the VQA communities."
72,Unsupervised refinement of color and stroke features for text binarization,"Abstract Color and strokes are the salient features of text
regions in an image. In this work, we use both these fea-
tures as cues, and introduce a novel energy function to
formulate the text binarization problem. The minimum of
this energy function corresponds to the optimal binarization.
We minimize the energy function with an iterative graph
cut-based algorithm. Our model is robust to variations in
foreground and background as we learn Gaussian mixture
models for color and strokes in each iteration of the graph
cut. We show results on word images from the challenging
ICDAR 2003/2011, born-digital image and street view text
datasets, as well as full scene images containing text from
ICDAR 2013 datasets, and compare our performance with
state-of-the-art methods. Our approach shows signiﬁcant
improvements in performance under a variety of perfor-
mance measures commonly used to assess text binarization
schemes. In addition, our method adapts to diverse document
images, like text in videos, handwritten text images.

advancement, exploring the role of these countable dopants in

the impact of dopant atoms from 3-different regions (i.e., 
source, drain, and body) onto the performance parameters of 
the FinFET device using the full 3D electronic device 
simulation. The influence of countable dopant atoms on body-

resulted 
in 
significant 
fluctuations in all electrical performance metrics. It has been 
observed that source/drain doping dominates the variations in 
electrical characteristics for underlap FinFET devices. The 
dopant atoms from the source/drain side contribute more than 
~50% of the overall variations in the drain current. Further, 
the findings of this work suggest a new FinFET device 
technology, i.e., single-dopant atom electronics."

73,Design of Cylindrical Surrounding Double-Gate MOSFET With Fabrication Steps Using a Layer-by-Layer Approach,"ABSTRACT
The semiconductors with nanometer-scale are subjected to various patterns and scaling
using the latest technology. The most widely used methods are top-down approaches in the design of
complex heterostructures. The top-down approach involves the photolithography to ion sequentially beaming
of the materials. In this context, the alternative layer-by-layer approach with cylindrical structures has
been discussed and supported by the subsequent results to make Cylindrical Surrounding Double-Gate
(CSDG) MOSFETs in this research work. This method involves the making of cylindrical structures with
high-resolution morphological structures of CSDG MOSFETs. The process has been described in detail
to design the CSDG MOSFETs with high-
dielectric materials to make them suitable for low-frequency
RF applications. The fast modulation of the Single Nano Wire (SNW) has been adopted for complex
heterostructure modeling. The high-
dielectric materials are placed in between the spacer and the gate
material to overcome the Short Channel Effects (SCEs). This method produces symmetrical and concentric
cylindrical structures of the CSDG MOSFETs with suitable layers. The minimum layer thickness achieved
is about 10 nm axial length along with the core of the SNW. This gives enough insight for the proposed
cylindrical structure to fabricate over the core of 2DEG. In this type of structure development, many
cylindrical structures with various properties can be designed. The parameters focused on the cylindrical
structure will be periodic, non-periodic, symmetric, asymmetric structures, and gaps/dots of nanometer scale.
This innovative method introduces the method of designing the symmetric CSDG MOSFET concerning the
center core. In this work, the authors focus on the suitable novel technique of designing cylindrical structures
with unique dimensions and physical properties using various semiconductor materials."

this 
research 
work, 
researchers 
have 
investigated the drain-engineered Silicon nano-tube tunnel FET. 
The performance of the Tunnel FET (TFET) by modulating the 
doping concentration in the drain region has been realized. For 
the realization of the tunnel FET in electronic device simulation 
non-local band to band tunneling (BTBT) model is utilized. The 
TFET device proposed in this work is tubular type in which there 
is a gate inside and outside the tube, due to which the controlling 
capacity over the charge carriers is excellent. Results have been 
compared with 45 nm gate length conventional Silicon nano-tube 
tunnel FET. It has been realized that on decreasing the doping of 
the split drain region, the ambipolar current decreased from 10-9 
A/µm to 10-11 A/µm, due to which it becomes suitable for low 
power memory applications, devices, and FETs. The outcomes 
show that the drive capability of the devices is increased."
73,Effect of Metal Gate Work Function Variation on Underlap FinFET,"Abstract: In the sub-20 nm regime, the conventional poly-Silicon material used for gate electrodes has 
been widely replaced by a metal gate. In this present research work, the influence of metal gate Work-
Function Variability (WFV) on electrical parameters for underlap FinFET devices has been realized 
using the 3D electronic device simulator. In addition, the standard deviation (σ) reveals that the impact 
of WFV on Gate-Source/Drain (g-s/d) underlap length led to substantial fluctuations in all electrical 
performance parameters. This analysis suggests that the impact of WFV on performance parameters 
dominates in shorter g-s/d underlap length FinFET device. In addition, SRAM cell variability of three 
different underlap FinFET devices due to WFV has been justified. It has been concluded that WFV results 
in substantial performance and reliability improvement in the designed underlap FinFET devices."

73,Methodology of Teaching and Learning for Micro-and Nano-Electronics During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Online Educational Tools,"Abstract — Worldwide students are having their education 
disrupted by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
pandemic. Due to this, numerous contact courses have recently 
been moved to the online format in academic reforms. 
Microelectronics, Nanoelectronics, Nano-Electro-Mechanical 
Systems (NEMS) and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems 
(MEMS), in general, become challenging to educate and learn 
for both lecturers and students, respectively in this pandemic 
scenario. The epidemic has also offered a stimulus to increase 
the use of educational tools. The primary goal is to use Project-
Based Learning (PBL) to explore conceptual online tools and 
generate attention in the field of MEMS and NEMS. This 
research describes a teaching style that combines PBL with 
NEMS and MEMS online courses for undergraduate students. 
This research work delves into the principles and ideas of 
Micro- and Nano-electronic models. Teaching styles develop 
understanding, skills, and values relative to the subject. The 
basics of MOSFETs, cantilever beams, biosensors, comb drive, 
piezoelectric devices, etc. are also examined clearly through 
assignments. The online platform is designed to develop creative 
concepts and model devices for future applications. Using the 
PBL technique, this research work fosters both academics and 
students' self-learning, resulting in more sophisticated studies 
on subjects such as NEMS, MEMS, and Bio-MEMS. This work 
displays its text description as well as numerical simulations. In 
a controlled experiment, two sets of pre- and post-evaluation 
analyses have been conducted to look at the impact of PBL 
utilizing numerical simulation tools on fundamental theory 
learning. 
The 
analytical 
assessment 
demonstrates 
that 
combining numerical simulation with PBL results in more 
efficient understanding of fundamental MEMS and NEMS 
ideas. It will be a potential teaching modality for the 
development of online courses in this area."
73,InP/AlGaAs Based CSDG MOSFET With Au/Pt Gate Materials for High Frequency/Hybrid Applications,"Abstract— Aluminium Gallium Arsenide (AlxGa1-xAs – 
Arbitrary Alloy) is a material used in the latest high-frequency 
devices for the advantages of the lesser band-gap and also 
optimal electron mobility coefficient. The value of resistance 
between the source and drain in the AlxGa1-xAs material is 
lesser than other material that makes the Indium Phosphide 
(InP) material most suitable to grow contacts on the 
Aluminium Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs). These materials will 
have a very low thermal budget as it is mainly based on the ion 
implantation model for designing. Re-grown contacts like 
drain and source have serious issues such as higher parasitic 
capacitances, which need utmost care while designing the 
MOSFET. The velocity of the electrons in the proposed model 
had considerably increased than the conventional MOSFETs 
by 14.63 % in the Au-Pt pair and 1"
73,Impact of Oxide Thickness Fluctuation for Resist- and Spacer-Defined FinFETs,"Abstract—The geometrical fluctuations such as Oxide 
Thickness Fluctuations (OTF) and Line Edge Roughness (LER) 
cause intrinsic statistical variations in the nanoscale FinFET 
technology. 
The 
OTF 
is 
primarily 
caused 
at 
a 
semiconductor/insulator (i.e., Si/SiO2) interface by random 
roughness of the gate oxide layer. This research work analyzes the 
effect of oxide roughness on the performance parameters of resist- 
and spacer-defined FinFETs. A large statistical ensemble has been 
considered to observe the effect of OTF for FinFET devices. 
Further, all results have been analyzed and compared with the 
ideal (i.e., rectangular) FinFET. These results reveal that intrinsic 
parameter fluctuations introduced by OTF become significant for 
resist-defined FinFET structures. In addition, physical insight for 
variability-resistant FinFET design has been realized."
73,Modeling and Electrical Performance Optimization of p-type SnO-based Cylindrical Thin-film Transistors,"Abstract— Scaling down is a signiﬁcant issue in semiconductor devices because of its physical
limitations. In this research article, Thin-Film Transistors (TFT) with cylindrical geometry have
been modeled and simulated for a high electrical p-type response using a 3D numerical simulator.
The workfunction is varied from 4.0 eV to 5.5 eV to analyze the performance of the simulated
TFTs. The maximum ﬁeld-eﬀect mobility of 30.2 cm2/V-s has been attained for the 4.0 eV device
followed by a low sub-threshold swing and On-Oﬀcurrent ratio of 368 mV/dec and 7.32 × 108,
respectively. These values are comparable with the countertype TFT devices. By realizing the
high electrical performance p-type CTFT, eﬃcient CMOSlike logic circuits can be implemented."
73,Optimization of a Nanowire-Based Biosensor and Its Performance Analysis,"Abstract — Alterations to the surface potential (by the 
attachment of molecules) control the operation of a Biosensor 
Field-Effect Transistor (BioFET). The conductance of the FET 
channel can be change by charged molecules, including 
biomolecules, bind to the dielectric material that usually makes 
up the FET gate. This is because the biomolecules can change 
the charge distribution of the underlying semiconductor 
material. For instance, BioFETs integrate a transistor device 
with a bio-sensitive layer to identify proteins and nucleic acids. 
Performance optimization and analysis of extended-gate 
BioFET sensors are the focus of this research work. A change 
in the semiconductor's electrostatic surface potential occurs 
due to a change in the surface charge distribution brought 
about by an analytic binding to a recognition element. The 
current between the source and drain electrodes varies as a 
result of this change in the surface potential of the 
semiconductor. This modification functions in the same 
manner as a gate voltage in a typical MOSFET. A change in 
current (or conductance) is a good indicator of analytic 
binding. 
Considering 
device 
characteristics, 
fluidic 
surroundings, and the polarity of charge in biomolecules, the 
authors have examined the opportunities and difficulties 
associated with biomolecule detection using Si-Nanowire (NW) 
biosensors. The results showed that the simulated device 
responded better to the detected biomolecules."
74,Energy management in microgrids using IoT considering uncertainties of renewable energy sources and electric demands: GBDT-JS approach,"Abstract
The energy management issue of microgrids typically adopts demand response programs and reconﬁguration of distribution
networks to improve the technical and ﬁnancial characteristics of microgrids. This manuscript proposes an energy management
optimization in micro grids using IoT by applying the GBDT-JS technique to account for the uncertainty introduced by
renewable energy sources and electric demands. The proposed technique is a combination of gradient boosting decision
tree algorithm (GBDT) and jellyﬁsh search (JS); hence, it is called GBDT-JS technique. The proposed method is to include
maximizing the beneﬁts of microgrids and reducing power ﬂuctuations to the main grid. This proposal presents a GBDT-JS
to develop the suitable adaptive day-ahead real-time energy dispatch under the occurrence of operating uncertainty based on
the energy management system (EMS). Energy dispatch is achieved to satisfy the many operating criteria based on optimum
solutions which are further implemented, for example minimum power ﬂuctuation and operating cost. The main aim of the
works contributions is shortened as below: (1) The optimum GBDT system is decided day-ahead depending on the predictive
microgrid system levels consider a many operating objects. (2) JS technique is improved a day-to-day basis, adopted to execute
the energy dispatch, and directly present in the uncertainty system. The GBDT-JS technique is done on MATLAB, and their
performance is compared to different existing techniques, such as slime mould optimization algorithm, side-blotched lizard
algorithm, and jellyﬁsh search (JS)."
74,Control system integration methods to maintain the position and speed of the robot in spatial forbidden areas,"Abstract  The independent movement of robotics in 
uncontrollable situations is difficult since it necessitates the 
cooperation of several components. It necessitates simulta-
neously creating a map for the surroundings, locating the 
robot inside that map, creating a motion schedule based on 
the map, implementing that schedule with the controllers, 
as well as other operations. The automated navigational 
issue, on either side, is critical for the growth of robots. 
Delivering packages, agriculture, search and relief, clean-
ing, monitoring, construction, and shipping are just a few 
of the applications which require this challenge to be han-
dled. All of such applications take place in unregulated 
conditions. A sophisticated cognition process is required to 
detect and respond to an uncertain place. There seem to be 
movable robots that can run, walk, leap, and perform other 
actions similar to their natural counterparts. The future of 
robotic systems, comprising the latest trends, is covered in 
this study. To prevent having to reanalyze a whole course

I.INTRODCTION 
 
In the present scenario, automobile world is linearly 
shifting towards automation. The major two principle 
components in industrial automation are programmable 
controllers and robotics. Automation is that the use of 
various 
management 
systems 
for 
operating 
instrumentation like machinery, processes in factories, 
boilers, and heat treating ovens, change on telephone 
networks, steering and stabilization of ships, craft and 
different applications and vehicles with low or reduced 
human intervention. Some processes are fully automatic. 
We are here use the automation to save the time, money 
and fuel in the Check Post and Toll Plaza Systems. In 
order to aid the tedious work and to serve the mankind, 
today’s general tendency is to develop an intelligent 
operation. This paper deals with the Check post and Toll 
Plaza Automation for a smarter traffic control and so it 
benefits the people in saving their time and wastage of 
petrol. 
 
Practically, each and every check post a similar function. 
However manual verification is done in each Check Post 
even the vehicle already checked in previous Check Post. 
The manual operation of the check post needs the person 
power so as to perform the operations like gap the gate, 
closing the gate, checking the vehicle details. Typically it 
additionally results in tension and inconvenience to the 
right folks. Within the same aspects toll assortment 
system several vehicles square measure waiting, it causes 
the traffic congestion, time and fuel wastage. 
 
This paper proposes an E-Toll payment which is very 
flexible that automates the verification process of vehicles 
pass by.  Because of increasing vehicles once a year, the 
time wasted on waiting at the check post/toll gate is ever 
increasing. Automatic check post and E-Toll will 
eliminates the above struggle.

75,Cut-Off Thickness Identification of Defects with Single and Two-Step Geometries Using SH1 Mode Conversion,"Abstract
The utilization of the cut-off property of higher-order SH wave modes, particularly SH1, holds promise for assessing the
remaining thickness of structures. However, the mode conversion behavior of SH wave modes poses a signiﬁcant challenge to
the accuracy of the cut-off method in quantifying remnant thickness. The occurrence of mode conversion depends on factors
such as the slope and defect thickness, leading to situations where the SH1 mode can persist below the cut-off frequency after
transmission through the defect. This mode conversion introduces errors during the defect quantiﬁcation process. This study
focuses on investigating the potential of using the cut-off feature of the SH1 mode for remnant thickness quantiﬁcation under
various defect geometry scenarios, including single and double step defects with different slopes and thickness reductions.
The capability to identify cut-off frequencies originates from the innate potential for mode conversion within geometries
featuring minor defect angles. When notable mode conversion occurs, particularly in cases involving larger defect angles, the
mode conversion process hinders the precise determination of the cut-off frequency."

AI models such as convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network 
(RNN) have been shown here to have the capability to simulate ultrasonic wave propagation in the 2-

to utilizing AI networks. Our DPAI model comprises ConvLSTM with an encoder-decoder structure, 
which learns a representation of spatio-temporal features from the input sequence datasets. The 
DPAI model is trained with finite element (FE) time-domain simulation datasets consisting of 
distributed single and multi-point source excitation in the medium, reflection from the simple

for modelling multiple point sources to simulate forward wave propagation, reflection from the

fundamental building blocks for majority of structural 
components. When excited with nondispersive fundamental shear 
horizontal (SH0) mode on plate and fundamental torsional (T(0,1)) 
mode on cylinders two wave packets of different wave velocities 
were noticed and reported. Second harmonic symmetric (s0) mode 
and an orthogonal-shear horizontal (sh0┴) mode were generated 
on a weakly nonlinear plate. Whereas second harmonic 
longitudinal (l(0,1)) mode and orthogonal torsional (t(0,1)┴) mode 
were generated on a cylindrical wave guide. The observation from 
numerical simulateions were validated experimentally. The 
DMSH modes possesses different group velocities and thus, each 
wave packet were observed as separate wave modes after a short 
cut-off distance around 40ߣߣ. This article looks at the DMSH

75,Arbitrary Virtual Array Source Aperture (AVASA) Ultrasound Imaging Technique Using Phased Array Excitation,"Abstract
In this paper, we proposed an advanced ultrasound imaging technique for enhancing the resolution and reducing the imaging
processing time by phased array excitement to create beamforming at virtual source positions. In the conventional full matrix
capture (FMC) technique, a single element is used for excitation, limiting the transmitted energy and hence reducing the
single-to-noise Ratio (SNR) of the received A-scans. The total focusing method (TFM) is implemented on the vast data
volume of the received FMC signals to generate virtually focused imaging, requiring high processing time. Therefore, we
have introduced two different scanning techniques to increase transmitted energy by exciting the group of the element to form
the virtual source below the transducer: (1) virtual array source aperture (VASA) method consists of multiple virtual sources
placed below the center of an active aperture with a ﬁxed focal distance. (2) arbitrary virtual array source aperture (AVASA)
method consists of multiple virtual sources located randomly below the active aperture. The ultrasound beam is sequentially
excited on each virtual source with predeﬁned delay law. While reception, all the transducers are used to form the FMC.
The image generation process is similar to the FMC–TFM method. To demonstrate the imaging capabilities of the proposed
techniques, we have performed experimentation on two sets of defective specimens with (a) side-drilled holes (SDHs) and
(b) cracks. Experimental results quantitatively compared with conventional FMC–TFM, the proposed method improves the
SNR by 35% and reduces computation time by 8 times."

Total ankle replacement (TAR) is the main clinical treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis, replacing the ankle joint with a 
metallic implant. Component loosening, fracture, and wear are the main reasons for implant failure, requiring revision 
surgery. A non-invasive guided wave monitoring technique is being developed to ultimately evaluate in-vivo implant 
device integrity and bone-implant interface conditions (osseointegration). Finite Element (FE) simulations were performed 
to investigate the feasibility and sensitivity of ultrasonic monitoring of the interface conditions, assessing suitable guided 
wave modes and excitation frequencies. A simplified implant geometry was developed for FE modelling in 
Abaqus/Explicit. Selected guided wave modes (higher-order longitudinal modes sensitive to bone/implant interface 
changes) were excited at the distal end of the metallic implant component for detection of variations of bone-implant 
contact conditions. Simulation results showed the feasibility for guided ultrasonic waves to monitor bone implant 
osseointegration. Guided wave signal amplitude and changes of arrival time of pulses propagating along the metallic

75,Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation (2022) 41:64,"Abstract
High piezoresistive smart nanocomposites strain sensors have attracted much attention because of their sensing ability 
to monitor structural integrity. Current nano-sensors have been successfully manufactured, but due to fabrication cost 
and inefficiency in multitasking, they are not in demand. This paper mainly focuses on the comparative study between 
advanced smart sensors called graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and conventional ultrasound sensor in the context of SHM 
in stainless steel. Here, the electrical resistance of the smart GNP sensor with the propagation of crack growth shifts from 
its baseline with the application of spectrum loading, which is helpful in crack failure. The post-processing method by 
conventional ultrasound is only helpful after the post-failure but not during crack propagation, which can be replaced 
by the GNP-doped poly (methyl methacrylate) PMMA sensor. Stresses around the hole change their shape from circular 
to elliptic, which is explained with the help of 2D Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) simulations and the crack 
opening mechanism by Abaqus 6.12. After 3* (1st spectrum loading), it was difficult to spot the crack location, which 
was monitored smartly with a graphene sensor. GNPs are highly sensitive to cyclic spectrum loading. Structural health 
monitoring (SHM) has been done by a graphene doped PMMA sensor having the highest gauge factor (GF) of 800Ω, that 
is 84. The electrical resistance’s baseline shifting was found to increase with crack growth. The GNPs spray-coated nano-
sensor helps in the early detection of crack propagation before failure. Hence, this can save the cost and life of structural 
components, which ultrasound sensor cannot do during crack growth."

The paper highlights a new paradigm using simulation-based analysis that employs physics-based

discusses the development of a Simulation Assisted ADR (Automatic Defect Recognition) using the 
physics-based simulation models of the different NDE/NDT imaging modalities as well as Deep

interpretation that includes lack of sufficient apriori data as well as biases in the data sets, among 
others.  Here, using the limited experimental/field NDE/NDT data sets that are available and by 
deriving critical statistical distribution parameters from this data set, the stochastics of the simulation 
models are determined. Thereby, the simulated data sets are generated using numerical simulations 
along with the variations in the different parameters during experimental/field data acquisition. This 
process allows the generation of simulated data sets in large quantity that augments the smaller data 
sets obtained experimentally. This rich data set is subsequently utilized to train the DL models and 
provide reliable ADR algorithms.  Weld and AL casting radiography data sets from Digital X-ray

structures early to ensure their structural safety. Nonlinear 
ultrasonic techniques in the guided medium are employed to

on a weekly nonlinear isotropic elastic plate while excited with a

primary SH0 were seemingly unaffected. Improved insights from 
this work may provide important implications for accurate early-
state defect detection in structural health monitoring and non-
destructive evaluation applications of critical structures."
75,Material characterization and thickness,"Abstract 
Particle reinforced polymer matrix composites (PMC) are widely used in the military aviation industry as a stealth 
coating for incident radar attenuation. These coatings are made up of many layers of different materials with 
varying thicknesses. In this study, we used terahertz (THz) spectral range by means of time-domain spectroscopy 
(TDS) to examine the thickness of iron particle reinforced polyurethane Radar Absorbing Paint (FE-PU-RAP) 
composite coatings non-destructively. For accurate estimation of the individual layer thickness in multi-layer 
coatings, precise knowledge of the material properties of the individual layers is a prerequisite. Hence, standalone 
samples of the individual layers have been initially employed to extract the material properties, such as the 
refractive index, absorption coefficient, etc. Then, the accurate thickness estimation by the time-of-flight 
measurement principle has been carried out using the reflected THz pulses. Further, since the individual reflected 
pulses from the multi-layered sample are overlapping in nature due to the optically thin coating thickness, a sparse 
deconvolution technique has been utilized for extracting each individual reflected time instant. The scattering 
from the iron particles also provides a challenge to the identification of the interface signals. This was addressed 
by optimizing the regularization parameter in the sparse deconvolution algorithm. With this technique, accurate 
estimation of each of the individual layers in the multi-layer sample has been accomplished, otherwise difficult 
non-destructively."
75,Implementing Data-Driven Approach for Modelling Ultrasonic Wave Propagation Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning (SDL),"Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a data-driven spatio-temporal deep learning (SDL) model,
to simulate forward and reﬂected ultrasonic wave propagation in the 2D geometrical domain, by
implementing the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) algorithm. The SDL model
learns underlying wave physics from the spatio-temporal datasets. Two different SDL models
are trained, with the following time-domain ﬁnite element (FE) simulation datasets, by applying:
(1) multi-point excitation sources inside the domain and (2) single-point excitation sources on the edge
of the different geometrical domains. The proposed SDL models simulate ultrasonic wave dynamics,
for the forward ultrasonic wave propagation in the different geometrical domains and reﬂected wave
propagation phenomenon, from the geometrical boundaries such as curved, T-shaped, triangular,
and rectangular domains, with varying frequencies and cycles. The SDL is a reliable model, which
generates simulations faster than the conventional ﬁnite element solvers."

75,Smart Graphene Nanoplatelet Strain Sensor for Natural Frequency Sensing of Stainless Steel (SS304) and Human Health Monitoring,"Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to monitor the natural frequency of stainless steel (SS304)
with and without defect by spray-coated smart graphene nanoplatelet (GNPs)-doped poly (methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposite strain sensor and human health by smart Lycra denim textile
sensor. Methods such as impact hammer test and NI-daq, ﬁnite element method (FEM) simulation by
Abaqus 6.12, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) study were applied for frequency monitoring of SS304.
For human health monitoring, edema disease inspection, cough, and biceps locomotion were studied
by graphene sol–gel textile sensor. We report eight sensors fabricated by scotch tape exfoliation
method and their sensitivity was checked in terms of gauge factor (GF). The highest and lowest
GF-based sensors were checked for sensitivity in the defect (hole) specimen. These sensors were used
to sense the natural frequency of SS304 at three different positions in the cantilever beam. The same
quantity of GNPs was used for making Lycra denim textile sensors for human health monitoring.
The Lycra denim textile sensor showed a 216% change in resistance in the left calf muscle, which
is less than right leg ﬂexibility, indicating good sensitivity. In addition, the textile sensor helped in
sensing coughing and biceps monitoring. The ease in fabrication and high sensitivity demonstrate the
potential ability of GNPs for futuristic smart material for structural and human health monitoring."
75,Optical properties of multilayer graphene nanoplatelet (mGNP)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composite flexible thin films prepared by solvent casting,"ABSTRACT
Multi-layer
graphene
nanoplatelet
(mGNP)/poly(methyl
methacrylate)
(PMMA) nanocomposite ﬂexible thin ﬁlms were prepared at various GNP
loadings (1–5 wt%) and their optical properties were investigated in the UV,
visible, and near IR region (200–850 nm). The transmittance and reﬂectance of
the ﬁlms reduced with an increase in the GNP loading. Although it is known
that the transmittance of pure graphene is independent of wavelength, it was
observed that in the UV region, the optical properties of mGNP/PMMA are
wavelength-dependent. However, at higher GNP loadings (3–5%), these ﬁlms
have shown optical properties with less wavelength dependency. This may be
attributed to diverse types of attenuation mechanisms in the nanocomposite
ﬁlms when graphene is incorporated as ﬁller in the polymer matrix. In the
visible region (400–700 nm), no such wavelength-dependent optical properties
were observed.

75,User-Centric Design: Flexible Strain Sensor Adhesive Tape,"Abstract  This research work focuses on developing a design 
framework for flexible strain sensors considering sensor 
performance, end-user difficulties and industrial packaging- 
cum-scalable feasibility. The sensor is prepared from PVDC-co-
VC and PSS-CNT polymer nanocomposite with an underneath 
adhesive coating and a top copper contact pad. The ratio of 
PVDC-co-VC/PSS-CNT is optimized towards its percolation to 
achieve maximum sensing performance. The developed flexible 
strain sensor tape shows a gauge factor of 15±1, and it is 
consistent throughout the length of the sensor tape. The PSS 
polymer functionalization plays a critical role in achieving the 
homogenized dispersion of CNT nanofillers which ensures the 
constant gauge factor along the length of the sensor. Finally, the 
flexible strain sensor is demonstrated for wearable electronics 
applications using an IOT-enabled portable interface device."
75,Graded Elastic Waveguide Metamaterial Rod for Up-Conversion of Longitudinal Axisymmetric Guided Ultrasonic Wave Modes,"ABSTRACT
Cylindrical or circular rod-type waveguides are of much interest in applications such as
measurement of flow, temperature, material properties in harsh environments, and also in medical diagnostics.
However, multiple waveguide modes exist in such systems, out of which only some are of interest to certain
applications. For example, L(0,3) longitudinal mode excitation can optimally transmit elastic waves into
the test specimen and help in better sensing and measurement when compared to other modes within the
family of longitudinal guided waves. This paper demonstrates the up-conversion of longitudinal modes
within the family of guided ultrasonic rod waves (from L(0,2) to L(0,3)), which is of interest to certain
waveguide transducer applications. The mode up-conversion is demonstrated using numerical simulations
and experiments. An analysis is used to bring more insights and guide the design of the metamaterial in this
process."
75,"IEEE JOURNAL ON FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS, VOL. 2, NO. 3, MAY 2023 265","Abstract— In the emerging flexible electronics field, flexible
and wearable sensors play a crucial role. Though many reports
focused on developing flexible sensors with novel materials,
translational research is scarce. This work focuses on a design
framework for flexible strain sensors considering the design
scalability, packaging feasibility, and end users’ issues along
with the performance. To be specific, a flexible strain sensor
tape framework is designed and developed using poly (vinyli-
dene chloride-co-vinyl chloride) (PVDC-co-VC) and polystyrene
sulfonate functionalized carbon nanotube (PSS-CNT) polymer
nanocomposite with underneath adhesive coating and a copper
contact pad atop the sensor. At the outset, numerical simulation
is also carried out to understand the impact of uneven adhesive
thickness profile on the sensor performance and emphasis the
necessity of uniform adhesive coating underneath the sensor.
Further, the PVDC-co-VC/PSS-CNT polymer nanocomposite is
systematically optimized to find its percolation threshold to
achieve its maximum performance. Later, the scaled-up long
flexible strain sensor tape is developed and validated by mea-
suring the gauge factor (GF) in multiple positions along the
length of the sensor tape; it shows the uniform GF value
of 15.2 ± 0.8 which ensures the sensor’s repeatability and
reproducibility. As a testimony, the developed flexible strain
sensor is demonstrated for wearable electronics applications
with an indigenously developed Internet of Things (IOT)-enabled
portable interface device. The present flexible strain sensor tape
design framework supports scalability and packaging feasibility
and solves end users’ installation issues."
75,Non-Destructive Testing of Quay Walls Using Submersible Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) In Waterways Around the North Sea Coast,"Abstract— The North Sea, with a coast length of 1590 km, is 
amongst the most active commercial shipping route in the 
world, and is subject to harsh environmental conditions 
throughout the year. Coastal protecting measures defend 
waterways around the North Sea coast against storms, rising sea 
levels, and corrosion. Quay walls, one of the most widely used 
coastal protection system, have been one of the fundamental 
building blocks of the economic system. They are designed to 
enable ship moorings and absorb impacts from vessels. Further, 
quay walls are used to allow shipment of goods to the vessels 
using heavy equipment. They must withstand varying water 
levels, environmental conditions, loads being carried in and out 
of the ports. Periodic asset maintenance of quay walls is 
therefore crucial to ensure uninterrupted services and minimum 
downtimes, and to prevent catastrophic damages and loss of 
lives. 
Quay walls are subject to numerous structural damages 
including interlock damage, scouring, impact damage, and 
corrosion of concrete, reinforcement, and steel components. 
Continuous inspection programs are required to timely 
maintain, and repair associated infrastructure. Conventionally, 
the underwater sections of the quay wall are inspected by 
professional divers carrying underwater cameras and sensors to 
perform visual and ultrasonic thickness measurement. 
However, diver-based methodologies are often restricted by 
limited operational durations, depths, and safety risks. Further, 
the waterways connected to the North Sea are subjected to 
numerous challenges including as dense marine growth, 
dynamic variations in water visibility, underwater currents or 
flow, and operation in confined spaces. To overcome these 
challenges and inherent risks associated with manned 
underwater operations, an alternative inspection approach 
using remotely operated robotic vehicles (ROV) indigenously 
developed by Planys BV is proposed in this paper. ROVs have 
several key advantages in comparison to the conventional-
manned operations including unlimited endurance, and depth 
of operation, live video streaming, improved data quality, and 
defect geotagging to improve result repeatability. 
These ROVs are controlled remotely from a safe location by 
a pilot. They are also compact and lightweight, deployable by a 
crew of two personnel. They carry underwater cameras and 
lights for live visual inspection, sonic and ultrasonic transducers 
for sonar surveys and ultrasonic thickness measurement, 
respectively. This paper presents a case study of inspecting sheet 
pile infrastructure using ROVs in waterways connecting the 
North Sea in Western Europe. Key details explaining the 
components of the ROV, and methodology of operation are 
discussed. Exemplary results from visual inspection and 
ultrasonic thickness measurement are depicted, showing 
satisfactory quality of data collected. Furthermore, details of 
data analysis and representation implementing state-of-the-art 
digital analysis dashboard to enable rapid and accurate 
interpretation, are presented. 
Key limitations of using freely swimming ROVs are 
described from the viewpoint of operational efficiencies and rate 
of inspection. Recommendations on development of next 
generation 
of 
robotic 
crawler 
devices 
for 
enhanced 
commercially viable inspection routines are discussed. The work 
presented in the paper may be of interest to authorities, asset 
owners and managers of marine assets, operating both, inland 
and nearshore."
75,Assessment of Structural Integrity of Submerged Concrete Structures Using Quantitative Non-Destructive Techniques Deployed from Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROV),"Abstract— Marine assets in ports, harbors, and those which 
are part of our civil infrastructure including dams and bridges 
undergo persistent structural deterioration over time. Several 
national and international disasters, in recent times, have 
proved that these ageing infrastructures pose high risk from 
both social and economic perspectives. Therefore, periodic 
inspection of marine assets is essential to detect early 
deterioration, to schedule maintenance and restoration plans to 
prolong their life, prevent catastrophic damages and loss of 
lives.  
Non-destructive testing of concrete structures is performed 
using numerous techniques including ultrasonic tomography, 
ground penetrating radar, and radiography to identify 
structural anomalies and predict remaining life. However, 
conventional inspection procedures are limited to areas of the 
structures which are easily accessible and safe to work. Concrete 
structures operating underwater, are subject to rates of 
corrosion and impact damage which are often higher than the 
part of the structure above water. However, today, there are few 
quantitative NDT techniques available to inspect submerged 
concrete assets — qualitative visual inspection by professional 
divers is the most widely used technique in the industry. Diver-
based visual inspection operations are subject to inherent risks, 
especially when operating under poor water visibility, 
underwater currents, and confined spaces. They also often 
mandate shutdown of operations of the asset. Manned 
underwater operations are also often inadequate to confidently 
comment on the assets’ integrity. Furthermore, often, several 
critical defects in concrete structures do not manifest on the 
surface to be visible in visual inspection routines until their 
severity is significant. Therefore, to mitigate these risks, this 
paper introduces a first-of-its-kind quantitative NDT technique 
for concrete structures operating underwater using robotic 
remotely operated vehicles (ROV) indigenously by Planys 
Technologies, an IIT Madras incubated company.  
The remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can be controlled from 
a safe location by a pilot. The ROV can be thought of as a 
platform which can carry payloads to perform operations as per 
the requirements of the application. ROV Beluga, described in 
this paper, carries numerous payloads including marine 
cameras to provide live visual feed for visual inspection and 
navigation, lasers for quantification of defect dimensions, sonars 
to conduct waterbed surveys, and transducers to perform NDT. 
ROV-based operations offer numerous advantages over diver-
based operations including unlimited endurance, enhanced 
visual inspection in turbid waters, improved systems for data 
acquisition and repeatability.  
Widely accepted concrete NDT techniques, Schmidt 
hammer and ultrasonic pulse velocimetry were chosen to be re-
engineered for underwater inspection on a robotic drone. Key 
constraints including operational complexity, power and 
communication, 
and 
data 
acquisition 
and 
processing 
requirements were considered in this process. Preliminary 
experimental studies performed in a lab-scaled facility, and in 
real field conditions, described in this paper, demonstrate the 
potential of ROV-based quantitative NDT of underwater 
concrete structures. Key realizations and limitations to practical 
implementation are also described. The work presented in this 
paper will be of interest to asset owners and managers, enabling 
them to make confident post-inspection decisions."

Aim: To assess alteration in the protein levels of major organs and induction of micronuclei in the freshwater fish, Channa punctatus following exposure 
to chlorpyrifos, while also investigating the potential mitigating effects of extracts from Melissa officinalis and Mentha piperita on the adverse impacts 
induced by this pesticide.
Methodology: Two weeks of acclimatized healthy fish were divided 
into four different groups. Group G1 served as the control group, 
while G2 contained chlorpyrifos (LC /10, 96 hr). Group G3 was 
50
-1
exposed to chlorpyrifos (LC /10, 96 hr) along with 8 mg l  of Melissa 
50
officinalis ethanolic extract, and similarly, G4 contained chlorpyrifos 
-1
(LC /10, 96 hr) along with 8 mg l  ethanolic extract of Mentha 
50
piperita. Sampling was conducted over various durations of 7, 14, 
21, and 28 days. The ethanolic extracts of Melissa officinalis and 
Mentha piperita were used as remedial compounds as they are rich 
in several bioactive compounds, primarily polyphenols.
Results: The investigation revealed a notable decrease in the total 
protein content of kidney, liver, gills and muscles following exposure 
to chlorpyrifos after each sampling duration. While, upon exposure 
to remedies containing the ethanolic extracts of Melissa officinalis 
and Mentha piperita, the protein levels exhibited a significant 
recovery (p < 0.05) in a duration-dependent manner, compared to 
the control group. This suggests a promising ameliorative capability 
of Melissa officinalis and Mentha piperita against chlorpyrifos toxicity. Further, the induction of micronuclei by chlorpyrifos and their subsequent recovery 
through the application of phytoextracts Melissa officinalis and Mentha piperita displayed a similar pattern, indicating the potential protective effects of 
these extracts against chlorpyrifos-induced genotoxicity.
Interpretation: It is plausible to conclude that standardized doses of Melissa officinalis and Mentha piperita hold the potential to enhance aquaculture 
practices and safeguard fish production in agriculturally contaminated water bodies. These findings emphasize their valuable contribution in sustaining 
fish health amidst toxic environments.

the fish diet, the potential immunostimulatory qualities of 
medicinal herbs-Asparagus racemosus and Withania somnifera 
were noted by Trivedi et al., (2023) in C. punctatus. Evidence of 
the protective effect of Acacia catechu against metal toxicity in C. 
punctatus has been elucidated by Dwivedi et al. (2015). The 
herbaceous plant, Melissa officinalis is rich in bioactive 
ingredients and has potent antioxidant properties (Doukani et al., 
2021). Melissa officinalis improves fish health and reduces 
oxidative stress and fish mortality (Wang et al., 2022). 
Phytochemicals like phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids and 
several others are present in Melissa officinalis. These 
compounds are active in stabilizing pharmacological effects and 
altering metabolism for health advantages (Zam et al., 2022).
Similarly, Mentha piperita also known as peppermint is 
rich in a variety of bio-active compounds like flavonoids, volatile 
oils, luteolin, hesperidin, organic components viz., menthol 
(45.34%), 1,8-cineole (4.46%), neo-menthol (4.24%), limonene 
(2.22%), menthone (16.04%), menthofuran (8.91%) and cis-
carane (8.70%) (Taherpour et al., 2017). Peppermint exhibits 
certain efficacy against tumors, germs, viruses, radiation, 
antioxidants, and inflammatory responses. (Chakraborty et al., 
2022). Recent studies have shown that plants with strong 
antioxidant phytochemicals give protection against a wide range 
of diseases (Urquiaga and Leighton, 2000). Fish serves as an 
excellent model for toxicity evaluation in aquatic environments. C. 
punctatus is employed as a test model in several research studies 
due to easy availability and adaptability, particularly to study the 
remedial impact of plant extracts against pesticide toxicity (Tiwari 
and Trivedi, 2019). This study correlates the remedial role of 
Melissa officinalis and Mentha piperita against chlorpyrifos 
toxicity, focusing on total protein values in major organs, and 
genotoxicity analysis using the micronuclei assay. 
Materials and Methods
Model animal for toxicity test: Live Channa punctatus fish 
(Family Channidae, Order Perciformes) measuring an average 
length of 12 ± 2.0 cm and weight 25 ± 2.0 g were purchased from 
the local fish market. They were carefully transported to the 
laboratory with enough water in the bucket, and transferred into 
glass aquaria containing 40 l of chlorine-free water for 
acclimatization. Previously, the fish were given a prophylactic 
treatment, which involved bathing them twice in a 0.05% KMnO  
4
solution for 60 sec, to prevent dermal bacterial infections. 
These fish were acclimatized for 14 days under following 
conditions: (Temperature of 24 ± 2ºC, pH-7.2 ±0.2, alkalinity-

performing the experiment. Fish food (Optimum) produced by 
Perfect Companion Group Co. Ltd., in Thailand was given to the 
fish.
Test Chemicals: Chlorpyrifos (20% EC) used as a test chemical 
was manufactured by FINO Agro Industries Hapur, India under 
the brand name Chloro Gold. Other chemicals were purchased 
from Sigma Aldrich and Merck for experimental work."

76,Tailoring of EMI Shielding Properties of Camphor Sulphonic Acid-Mediated Polypyrrole Nanomaterials,"Abstract
Polypyrrole (PPy) nanomaterials have been synthesized with varying concentrations (10–40 mM) of anionic surfactant 
camphor sulphonic acid (CSA) using the chemical polymerization method, and then utilized for electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) shielding applications in the X-band of the microwave frequency range (8.2–12.4 GHz). An observable systematic 
change in the morphology of the prepared PPy has been noted, with highly aggregated globules transforming into fibular-
like structures with an average diameter of approximately 80–120 nm as the CSA concentration increased. Raman and 
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements indicate an increase in the relative intensities of the bipolaronic to polaronic 
bands, suggesting an improved conjugation of PPy with increasing CSA concentration. The electrical conductivity at room 
temperature has also been found to increase significantly, from 2.55 S/cm to 35.80 S/cm, as the concentration of CSA 
surfactant increased from 10 mM to 40 mM. Additionally, the shielding effectiveness (SE) for reflection ­(SER), SE for 
absorption ­(SEA), and total SE ­(SET) have been found to increase with increasing CSA concentration in PPy. The ­SET 
values have been found exceeding 35 dB throughout the X-band of the microwave region in PPy nanomaterials with CSA 
concentrations ≥ 20 mM. It has been observed that CSA-directed polypyrrole exhibits high electrical conductivity, where 
the SE for absorption ­(SEA) dominates over the SE for reflection ­(SER). This study suggests that the properties of PPy can 
be easily tailored for its potential utilization in the fabrication of various EMI shielding devices with improved performance."
76,Utility of Urinary Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in COVID-19,"Abstract  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication 
of COVID-19 and urinary biomarkers of renal “stress” 
and “injury” can be utilised for an early diagnosis. In this 
prospective observational study, critically-ill adult patients 
with COVID-19 disease from November 2020 to May 2021 
were recruited and urine samples collected at the time of 
admission to ICU, and subsequently at 12, 24 and 48 h and 
analysed for biomarkers of “renal injury” namely KIM-1, 
NGAL, IL-18, and cell cycle arrest biomarker IGFBP-7 and 
TIMP-2 which have been reported to increase following 
renal stress. Spot urine samples were collected and to adjust 
for dilution, sample volume and rate of urine production, 
assays of the biomarkers were normalised by dividing the 
values with urinary creatinine concentration. The incidence 
of AKI in our study was 22.64% (24/106). Patients in the 
AKI group were older with significantly higher require-
ments for invasive mechanical ventilation, inotropic sup-
port, longer hospital stay, and higher mortality. Diagnostic

back to routine work were assessed and noted. Result: In this study, all 30 
patients were in the follow-up group with 22 male and 8 female patients. The 
mean age was 34.6 years (between 22 and 55 years) in the group. Out of the 30 
patients, at 3 months 18 (60%) patients experienced no pain. At 6 months, 22 
(73.33%) patients experienced no pain with 5 points. Out of 30 patients, at 3 
months 10 (33.33%) patients experienced mild pain and at 6 months 5 
(16.67%) experienced mild pain with 4 points. comparing fracture type and 
union time statistically significant. Comparing constant score with fracture 
type, statistically not significant. Conclusion: Thus, the intramedullary 
fixation of a displaced midshaft clavicle fracture is a safe minimally invasive 
technique. The present study advises the use of minimally invasive antegrade 
titanium elastic nails for the fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. 
However, for comminuted fractures plating remains the procedure of choice."

Background: Self-medication, as defined by the World Health Organization, 
refers to the use of medicinal products by consumers to treat self-recognized 
disorders or symptoms, or the intermittent or continued use of a medication 
prescribed by a physician for chronic or recurring diseases or symptoms. 
Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study on randomly selected 
group of 100 pregnant women attending the department of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology of our institute. Data collection was done through a pre-structured 
questionnaire. Result: The average age was 23.7±3.68 years. The majority of 
participants were in the age group of 18-29 years. 74% of participants were 
taking iron and folic acid supplements, but only 38.5% were aware of the 
purpose of these supplements, and only 16% knew the recommended duration 
for taking. Additionally, only half of participants were taking these supplements 
regularly. Conclusion: Pregnant women show a lack of awareness about the 
impact of drugs on the health of the fetus. Over half of them regularly take 
medication, but a small percentage opt for self-medication during pregnancy, 
indicating a preference for seeking advice from a physician."

76,Negative impact of Interleukin-9 on synovial regulatory T cells in rheumatoid arthritis,"Abstract
In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), regulatory T cells Tregs) have been found to be enriched in the 
synovial fluid. Despite their accumulation, they are unable to suppress synovial inflammation. 
Recently, we showed the synovial enrichment of interleukin-9 (IL-9) producing helper T cells 
and its positive correlation with disease activity. Therefore, we investigated the impact of IL-9 
on synovial Tregs in RA. Here, we confirmed high synovial Tregs in RA patients, however these 
cells were functionally impaired in terms of suppressive cytokine production (IL-10 and TGF-β. 
Abrogating IL-9/IL-9 receptor interaction could restore the suppressive cytokine production of 
synovial Tregs and reduce the synovial inflammatory T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α,IL-17. 
However, blocking these inflammatory cytokines failed to show any effect on IL-9 producing 
T cells, highlighting IL-9’s hierarchy in the inflammatory network. Thus, we propose that 
blocking IL-9 might dampen synovial inflammation by restoring Tregs function and inhibiting 
inflammatory T cells.

Financial inclusion refers to a strategic approach aimed at 
facilitating access to financial services for marginalised 
populations, including individuals residing in poverty-
stricken 
and 
low-income 
neighbourhoods. 
The 
importance of entrepreneurship and employment growth 
cannot be overstated, since it has the potential to 
significantly enhance economic growth. The challenges 
encompass 
several 
factors 
such 
as 
inadequate 
infrastructure, low income levels, poverty, legislative 
limitations, geographical remoteness, restricted financing 
availability, and concerns related to data privacy. 
Financial institutions establish and provide support to 
Self-Help Groups (SHGs), hence facilitating their role in 
fostering economic development. Women have a 
prominent role in Self-Help Groups (SHGs), exerting 
significant influence on both the overall economic 
development of the nation and the welfare of their 
families. The Self-Help Group Bank Linkage Programme 
(SHGBLP) is an initiative aimed at mitigating transaction 
costs for Indian banks while concurrently augmenting the 
average annual income of low-income households by 
72%. 
Self-help groups (SHGs) are widely recognised as a 
prevalent method of promoting financial inclusion in 
India. According to the findings of a survey, it was

displayed 
a 
comparatively lower level of financial literacy. This study 
investigates the relationship between microfinance 
institutions and financial inclusion in the context of rural 
development and self-help organisations in Haryana, 
India. The findings reveal a significant correlation 
between microfinance institutions and the promotion of 
financial inclusion. The concept of connecting Self-Help 
Groups (SHGs) with banks is widely recognised as a 
prominent approach for promoting financial inclusion, 
primarily due to its ability to attract a significant number 
of new clients. The promotion of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) 
and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) has the potential to 
mitigate the financial disparity between individuals who 
lack access to formal banking services and those who are 
financially included. 
This study also investigates the perspectives of branch 
managers about financial inclusion and the role played by 
Business Correspondents (BCs) in promoting inclusivity. 
This study demonstrates the impact of individual 
circumstances on the accessibility of banking services for 
families 
in

Nagpur mandarin is well known globally for its excellent nutritional benefits and flavour. These all 
characteristics get affected during storage due to a lack of knowledge & processing techniques. 
One of the most important parameters which decide the quality of fruit juice during storage is cloud 
stability, which gets affected during storage due to the action of an enzyme named pectin 
methylesterase. Pectin methylesterase enzyme (PME) is a heat-resistant enzyme that impacts the 
juice quality by decreasing the cloud stability. Thermosonication is a technique to reduce the PME 
activity in juice by utilizing the principle of heat and ultrasound. Therefore, an experiment was 
carried out to inactivate the PME utilizing the ultrasound combined with higher temperature known

calculate the effect of thermosensation treatment on the pectin methylesterase enzyme (PME) 
activity along with the effect of thermosensation on cloud stability in comparison with various 
thermal pasteurization treatments. Juice samples were thermosonicated at temperatures of 50 ℃, 
55 ℃, 60 ℃, and 63 ℃ for 25, 20, 15 and 10 min respectively at a constant frequency of 40 kHz. 
Juice samples were also thermally pasteurized at 65 ℃, 75 ℃, 85 ℃, and 95 ℃ for 80, 60, 40, and 
20 sec. Samples were analyzed after treatment at 0 days and 7 days of refrigerated storage at 4 ℃. 
Result indicated that thermosensation at 63 ℃ for 10 min at 40 kHz frequency showed much 
reduced PME activity with inactivation of 72.56% over control whereas thermal pasteurization at 95 
℃ showed inactivation of 69.31%. The same treatment also showed maximum cloud activity as 
compared to control and thermally pasteurized juice samples. Hence thermosensation can be used 
as an alternative processing technique for the inactivation of PME and cloud stability."

77,Study of Contact Line Parameters of Evaporating Sessile Drops from Various Substrates,"Abstract
The entire process of evaporation is described by diffusion, convection, and various equations of heat transfer that simulta-
neously influence the process and hence, make it a complex phenomenon. The varying evaporation rate of a drop of liquid 
from the surface of a solid substrate is a function of the diffusion rate of vapor into the medium surrounding the droplet. The 
evaporation of a liquid is a naturally occurring phenomenon. If the immediate vicinity is not saturated with liquid-vapor, the 
liquid drops evaporate over time. The dimensions of the droplet are expressed to have a functional relationship with time. 
Also, the effect of drop parameters on different tribologically engineered substrates is observed with time."
77,De-Icing Device With Self-Adjusting Power Consumption and Ice Sensing Capabilities,"Abstract—Ice accumulation on mechanical structures pose
series of safety challenges in daily life. Therefore, it is important
to detect the presence of ice and subsequently remove it, thereby
hindering its accumulation. We demonstrate an electrode design
which can function concurrently as an ice detection and de-icing
system. A dielectric coated interdigitated device was fabricated.
Ice was generated using a Peltier cooler. By measuring the
impedance change of the device with frequency under different
conditions (dry and wet), ice was detected. Extent of ice formation
can be estimated from the impedance values. Using the same
interdigitated electrode device, de-icing was also established by
applying a high frequency (50 kHz) and high voltage (200 Vrms)
AC signal. The output power of the system was calculated
using an equivalent circuit model which also showed that the
de-icing system delivers negligible output power in the absence
of ice making it energy efﬁcient. For performing de-icing on
curved structures, the technique was demonstrated using ﬂexible
substrates where interdigitated electrodes were printed on ﬂex
polyamide substrates.

77,DIRECT HEATING OF DROPLETS FOR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ,"ABSTRACT 
We demonstrate a novel concept to heat a drop. Temperature rise occurs when high frequency (10-50 kHz) AC 
actuation voltage (270 Vrms-460 Vrms) is applied on the dielectric coated coplanar electrodes. The temperature rise 
(up to 40 °C) inside the drop provides calibrated high temperatures for enabling chemical reactions on Lab-on a-
Chip devices. Droplet spreading along the electrode gap happens as this actuation regime also coincides with 
dielectrophoresis. The proposed technique does not require separate microheaters on the chip as electrodes designed 
for droplet actuation can be used to achieve localized heating."
77,Measurement Science and Technology,"Abstract
Real time monitoring of the mass of an evaporating liquid drop from a real surface by optical 
methods cannot account for the volume of the drop that gets trapped between asperities. Mass 
measurement methods do not have high resolution, necessary to account for the small volume 
of the drop trapped in the pores. This work uses a non resonant mass sensor with a goniometer 
to simultaneously measure the mass and contact angle of the evaporating drop. Evaporative 
flux is used as the quantity of comparison across all surfaces. For a pinned sessile drop, 
the evaporative flux remains almost a constant for any kind of surface. For inkjet printing 
paper, the negative slope of the flux rate means evaporation is dominant. The drop breaches 
the hydrophobic coating on the paper to indicate a positive slope of this flux rate. In short, 
evaporation is strictly controlled by relative humidity and not the nature of the substrate."
77,Effect of micropillar surface texturing on friction under elastic dry reciprocating contact,"Abstract
Surface texturing is considered to be a
promising method to improve the tribological proper-
ties. Depending upon the experimental conditions, the
effect of texturing varies from favourable to unno-
ticeable to detrimental. In this work, surfaces with
micropillars are studied under elastic dry reciprocating
contact. An array of micropillars with different pillar
heights are generated on stainless steel using wire-cut
electrical discharge machining. The effect of stiffness
of the micropillars on friction is investigated, keeping
the number of micropillars in contact with a ﬂat
aluminium alloy (Al6061) slider and contact geometry
constant. Reciprocating experiments are carried out
against a ﬂat surface such that about 81 micropillars
are in contact. From the experimental results, it is
found that the coefﬁcient of friction is independent of
the stiffness of the texture elements. However, work
done per cycle signiﬁcantly varied with the stiffness of
texture element and applied normal load. A lumped
system model with Coulomb friction shows that the
work done per cycle varies quadratically with the
normal load. The experimental results agree with this
simpliﬁed model except in the incipient sliding
regime. These results show how the work done per
cycle varies, for different contact stiffness under
elastic contact even though the coefﬁcient of friction
remains constant. The implication of this study for a
macroscopic measured coefﬁcient of friction as a
function of microscopic asperity level friction is
discussed."

to scale making it suitable for portable applications."
77,Energy Loss Due to Adhesion During the Impact of Elastic Spheres,"Abstract
The impact of elastic spheres in presence of adhesion has been extensively studied due to its wide-ranging signiﬁcance. A major
emphasis of such studies is the energy loss occurring during impacts. Energy loss due to elastic stress waves is of special signif-
icance, as it could be the only active energy loss mechanism in many cases. In this work, we use ﬁnite element method to study
the impact of elastic spheres on a rigid half-space in presence of adhesion. Adhesion, caused by van der Waals force, is modeled
as a body force. This formulation helps to avoid many of the restrictions imposed by the commonly-used surface-force model of
adhesion.
The energy loss in adhesive impact of elastic spheres is predominantly due to the stress waves caused by adhesion-induced
instability, which is absent below a critical sphere radius. Therefore, the coeﬃcient of restitution increases with increase in sphere
radius below this critical value, while it shows a reducing trend above it, within the range of sphere radii considered in this study.
Therefore, our study indicates that the variation of critical velocity for capture with sphere radius will not be monotonic, unlike
presented in many of the previous studies.

77,JBO-160670PR 8..8 ++,"Abstract. Several medical procedures involve the use of needles. The advent of robotic and robot assisted
procedures requires dynamic estimation of the needle tip location during insertion for use in both assistive
systems as well as for automatic control. Most prior studies have focused on the maneuvering of solid flexible
needles using external force measurements at the base of the needle holder. However, hollow needles are used
in several procedures and measurements of forces in proximity of such needles can eliminate the need for
estimating frictional forces that have high variations. These measurements are also significant for endoscopic
procedures in which measurement of forces at the needle holder base is difficult. Fiber Bragg grating sensors,
due to their small size, inert nature, and multiplexing capability, provide a good option for this purpose.
Force measurements have been undertaken during needle insertion into tissue mimicking phantoms made of
polydimethylsiloxane as well as chicken tissue using an 18-G needle instrumented with FBG sensors. The
results obtained show that it is possible to estimate the different stages of needle penetration including partial

77,Paper Title (use style: paper title),"Abstract — On-chip cooling poses a potential challenge in 
semiconductor industry. Electronic devices generate more heat 
when scaled down and thus heat needs to be dissipated 
effectively. For cooling local hot spots on electronic chips, 
Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) based droplet cooling has 
been adapted. But here the performance of droplet evaporation 
is limited by the area of cooling at a particular time. Therefore, 
the technology needs efficient control over the droplets in order 
to maximize the cooling rate. In the present work, a large hot 
spot area (15mm2) has been cooled using a single deionized 
water drop by inducing non-uniform electric field. Water 
droplet on two coplanar electrodes, upon applying AC voltage, 
experiences non-uniform electric field and spreads along the 
electrodes. 
This 
phenomenon, 
known 
as 
Liquid 
Dielectrophoresis (L-DEP), enables the drop to spread. Cr/Au 
coplanar electrodes have been patterned with 100μm gap along 
with a back side aligned Ti/Pt heater in the gap between the 
coplanar electrodes. Heat flux of 100W/cm2 is applied to the 
heater by constant power mode and effective evaporation of the

consumption for the droplet spreading is calculated as 30.2μW

77,Effect of absolute pressure on flow through a textured hydrophobic microchannel,"Abstract  The potential of textured hydrophobic surfaces 
to provide substantial drag reduction has been attributed to 
the presence of air bubbles trapped on the surface cavities. 
In this paper, we present results on water flow past a tex-
tured hydrophobic surface, while systematically varying the 
absolute pressure close to the surface. Trapped air bubbles 
on the surface are directly visualized, along with simul-
taneous pressure drop measurements across the surface 
in a microchannel configuration. We find that varying the 
absolute pressure within the channel greatly influences the 
trapped air bubble behavior, causing a consequent effect on 
the pressure drop (drag). When the absolute pressure within 
the channel is maintained below atmospheric pressure, we 
find that the air bubbles grow in size, merge and eventu-
ally detach from the surface. This growth and subsequent 
merging of the air bubbles leads to a substantial increase in 
the pressure drop. On the other hand, a pressure above the 
atmospheric pressure within the channel leads to gradual 
shrinkage and eventual disappearance of trapped air bub-
bles. We find that in this case, air bubbles do cause reduc-
tion in the pressure drop with the minimum pressure drop 
(or maximum drag reduction) occurring when the bub-
bles are flush with the surface. These results show that the 
trapped air bubble dynamics and the pressure drop across 
a textured hydrophobic microchannel are very significantly 
dependent on the absolute pressure within the channel. The

The anti-icing properties of hydrophilic, hydrophobic and superhydrophobic 
surfaces/coatings were evaluated using a custom-built apparatus based on zero-degree cone 
test method. The ice-adhesion reduction factor (ARF) of these coatings has been evaluated 
using bare aluminium alloy as a reference. The wettability of the surfaces was evaluated by 
measuring water contact angle (WCA) and sliding angle. It was found that the ice-adhesion 
strength (τ) on silicone based hydrophobic surfaces was ~ 43 times lower than compared to 
bare polished aluminium alloy indicating excellent anti-icing property of these coatings. 
Superhydrophobic coatings displayed poor anti-icing property in spite of their high water 
repellence. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope reveal that  Silicone based 
hydrophobic coatings exhibited smooth surface whereas the superhydrophobic coatings had a 
rough surface  consisting of microscale bumps and protrusions superimposed with 
nanospheres. Both surface roughness and surface energy play a major role on the                    
ice-adhesion strength of the coatings. The 3D surface roughness profiles of the coatings also 
indicated the same trend of roughness. An attempt is made to correlate the observed τ of 
different surfaces with their wettability and surface roughness. It was concluded that smooth 
surface with low surface energy are responsible for low ice-adhesion strength."
77,ORIGINAL PAPER,"Abstract
The characteristics of surface roughness span a
range of length scales determined by the nature of the
surface generation process. The mechanism by which
material is removed at a length scale determines the
roughness at that scale. Electropolishing preferentially
reduces the peaks of surface protuberances at sub-micron
length scales to produce smooth surfaces. The material
removal
in electropolishing occurs by two different
mechanisms of anodic leveling and microsmoothing. Due
to insufﬁcient lateral resolution, individual contribution of
these two mechanisms could not be measured by conven-
tional roughness measurement techniques and parameters.
In this work, we utilize the high lateral resolution offered
by Atomic force microscopy along with the power spectral
density method of characterization, to study the evolution
of roughness during electropolishing. The power spectral
density show two corner frequencies indicating the length
scales over which the two mechanisms operate. These
characteristic frequencies are found to be a function of the
electropolishing time and hence can be used to optimize
the electropolishing process."

Nanoscale surface modiﬁcation, by the inter-

tacts, with reciprocating wear tests imaged in situ at the
nanoscale over [300 cycles in a transmission electron
microscope. Between sliding surfaces, friction-formed
nanoparticles are observed with rolling, sliding and spin-
ning motions, dependant on localised contact conditions
and particle geometry. Over periods of many scratch
cycles, nanoparticles dynamically agglomerate into elon-
gated clusters, and dissociate into smaller particulates. We
also show that the onset of rolling motion of these particles
accompanies a reduction in measured friction."

Air can be trapped on the crevices of specially textured hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water. This 
heterogenous state of wetting in which the water is in contact with both the solid surface and the entrapped 
air is not stable. Diffusion of air into the surrounding water leads to gradual reduction in the size and 
numbers of the air bubbles. The sustainability of the entrapped air on such surfaces is important for many 
underwater applications in which the surfaces have to remain submersed for longer time periods. In this 
paper we explore the suitability of different classes of surface textures towards the drag reduction application 
by evaluating the time required for the disappearance of the air bubbles under hydrostatic conditions. 
Different repetitive textures consisting of holes, pillars and ridges of different sizes have been generated in 
silicon, aluminium and brass by isotropic etching, wire EDM and chemical etching respectively. These 
surfaces were rendered hydrophobic with self-assembled layer of fluorooctyl trichlorosilane for silicon and 
aluminium surfaces and 1-dodecanethiol for brass surfaces. Using total internal reflection the air bubbles are 
visualized with the help of a microscope and time lapse photography. Irrespective of the texture, both the 
size and the number of air pockets were found to decrease with time gradually and eventually disappear. In 
an attempt to reverse the diffusion we explore the possibility of using electrolysis to generate gases at the 
textured surfaces. The gas bubbles are nucleated everywhere on the surface and as they grow they coalesce 
with each other and get pinned at the texture edges."
78,An induction motor loss Optimization approach using JMAG and MATLAB for an electric vehicle,"Abstract— An electric motor can be considered as the heart 
of an electric vehicle, especially for a pure electric vehicle, 
where it provides sufficient torque for it to move. So, it is very 
important that all the aspects related to the electric motor 
should be carefully designed and modelled. In the case of a 
pure electric vehicle, the motor losses are the major 
contributor among all other losses. So, it becomes inevitable to 
minimize those losses and extract maximum possible efficiency, 
in order to prominently reduce the energy consumption of the 
vehicle. In this paper, an overall optimized loss equation of an 
Induction motor is proposed. Modified Particle Swarm 
Optimization is applied to get the desired value of stator flux 
reference, electromagnetic torque, and operating speed such 
that the motor losses are minimum. These values can be 
employed as reference control signals to implement control 
strategies of a power train in an electric vehicle. The 
optimization is realistically validated by obtaining the required 
motor parameters that are commercially available from 
JMAG, in order to have good accuracy and reliability."
78,An Optimization Based PID Controller tunning approach for the induction motor employed in an Electric Vehicle,"Abstract— An electric motor is the only prime mover 
employed for operating a pure electric vehicle. The overall 
tractive movement of the vehicle depends on the operational 
characteristics of the motor. The fuel efficiency also depends on 
the performance of the motor. The output parameters of a 
motor are usually torque and speed. These output parameters 
must be optimally controlled in order to meet the required 
demand/ drive cycle. So, a proper feedback control strategy is 
required in order to dynamically control the motor for the set 
reference. The proposed research investigation employs an 
optimized PI controller for tracking the set operational speed of 
the motor. The adaptive tuning of controller parameters 
yielding minimum error is obtained by using Modified Particle 
Swarm Optimization. The realistic specification or parameters 
of three phase induction motor are obtained from JMAG."
79,"Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 3171–3192, 2024","Abstract. We present the geophysical data set acquired in summer 2022 close to Ny-Ålesund (western Sval-
bard, Brøggerhalvøya Peninsula, Norway) as part of the project ICEtoFLUX. The aim of the investigation is to
characterize the role of groundwater ﬂow through the active layer as well as through and/or below the permafrost.
The data set is composed of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys,
which are well-known geophysical techniques for the characterization of glacial and hydrological processes and
features. Overall, 18 ERT proﬁles and 10 GPR lines were acquired, for a total surveyed length of 9.3 km. The
data have been organized in a consistent repository that includes both raw and processed (ﬁltered) data. Some
representative examples of 2D models of the subsurface are provided, that is, 2D sections of electrical resistivity
(from ERT) and 2D radargrams (from GPR). The resistivity models revealed deep resistive structures, probably
related to the heterogeneous permafrost, which are often interrupted by electrically conductive regions that may
relate to aquifers and/or faults. The interpretation of these data can support the identiﬁcation of the active layer,
the occurrence of spatial variation in soil conditions at depth, and the presence of groundwater ﬂow through the
permafrost. To a large extent, the data set can provide new insight into the hydrological dynamics and polar and
climate change studies of the Ny-Ålesund area. The data set is of major relevance because there are few geophys-
ical data published about the Ny-Ålesund area. Moreover, these geophysical data can foster multidisciplinary sci-
entiﬁc collaborations in the ﬁelds of hydrology, glaciology, climate, geology, and geomorphology, etc. The geo-
physical data are provided in a free repository and can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10260056

79,GPR Mapping of Cavities in Complex Scenarios with a Combined Time–Depth Conversion,"Abstract: The paper deals with a combined time–depth conversion strategy able to improve the
reconstruction of voids embedded in an opaque medium, such as cavities, caves, empty hypogeal
rooms, and similar targets. The combined time–depth conversion accounts for the propagation
velocity of the electromagnetic waves both in free space and in the embedding medium, and it allows
better imaging and interpretation of the underground scenario. To assess the strategy’s effectiveness,
ground penetrating radar (GPR) data referred to as an experimental test in controlled conditions are
accounted for and processed by two different approaches to achieve focused images of the scenario
under test. The first approach is based on a classical migration algorithm, while the second one
faces the imaging as a linear inverse scattering approach. The results corroborate that the combined
time–depth conversion improves the imaging in both cases."
79,"An Integrated Geophysical and Unmanned Aerial Systems Surveys for Multi-Sensory, Multi-Scale and Multi-Resolution Cave Detection: The Gravaglione Site (Canale di Pirro Polje, Apulia)","Abstract: Gravaglione represents one of the main swallow holes of the Canale di Pirro, low Murge,
Apulia region, Italy. Here, after an intense rainstorm, a huge volume of rainwater accumulates
at the surface. The drainage dynamics suggest that the Gravaglione could be part of a large, and
potentially unknown, karst system. To verify this hypothesis and to acquire useful information
on the possible karst environment features, an integrated aerial and geophysical multiscale and
multimethod approach was applied. In particular, aerial photogrammetry, ground penetrating radar
measurements and electrical resistivity tomography surveys were hence conducted and integrated to
potentially detect the caves, deﬁne the subsurface volume possibly affected by karst systems and to
verify the existence of links between the surﬁcial morphology and the subsoil structure. The results
provided interesting insights regarding the presence of a complex karst system extending up to
200 m b.g.l. and with a marked 3D nature. Overall, the Gravaglione case study demonstrates the
geophysical approach validity and poses the basis for the development of an expeditive and low-cost
high-resolution strategy for detecting and characterizing karst caves."
79,"Imaging Cultural Heritage at Different Scales: Part I, the Micro-Scale (Manufacts)","Abstract: Applications of non-invasive sensing techniques to investigate the internal structure and
surface of precious and delicate objects represent a very important and consolidated research ﬁeld in
the scientiﬁc domain of cultural heritage knowledge and conservation. The present article is the ﬁrst
of three reviews focused on contact and non-contact imaging techniques applied to surveying cultural
heritage at micro- (i.e., manufacts), meso- (sites) and macro-scales (landscapes). The capability to
infer variations in geometrical and physical properties across the inspected surfaces or volumes
is the unifying factor of these techniques, allowing scientists to discover new historical sites or to
image their spatial extent and material features at different scales, from landscape to artifact. This
ﬁrst part concentrates on the micro-scale, i.e., inspection, study and characterization of small objects

to internal properties."
79,Combined GPR and Self-Potential Techniques for Monitoring Steel Rebar Corrosion in Reinforced Concrete Structures: A Laboratory Study,"Abstract: Steel rebar corrosion is one of the main causes of the deterioration of engineering reinforced
structures. Steel rebar in concrete is normally in a non-corroding, passive condition, but these
conditions are not always achieved in practice, due to which corrosion of rebars takes place. This
degradation has physical consequences, such as decreased ultimate strength and serviceability of
engineering concrete structures. This work describes a laboratory test where GPR and SP geophysical
techniques were used to detect and monitor the corrosion phenomena. The laboratory tests have
been performed with several reinforced concrete samples. The concrete samples were partially
submerged in water with a 5% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Therefore, an accelerated corrosion
phenomenon has been produced by a direct current (DC) power supply along the rebar. The
geophysical measurements were performed with a 2.0 GHz centre frequency GPR antenna along
several parallel lines on the samples, always being the radar line perpendicular to the rebar axis. The
GPR A-scan amplitude signals were elaborated with the Hilbert Transform approach, observing the
envelope variations due to the progress of the steel rebar corrosion in each concrete sample. Moreover,
Self-Potential acquisitions were carried out on the surface of the concrete sample at the beginning and
end of the experiments. Each technique provided speciﬁc information, but a data integration method
used in the operating system will further improve the overall quality of diagnosis. The collected data
were used for an integrated detection approach useful to observe the corrosion evolution along the
reinforcement bar. These ﬁrst laboratory results highlight how the GPR should give a quantitative
contribution to the deterioration of reinforced concrete structure."
79,Investigation of the Geological Structure of the Tramutola Area (Agri Valley): Inferences for the Presence of Geofluids at Shallow Crustal Levels,"Abstract: The Tramutola area in the High Agri Valley represents a key for the Southern Apennines fold
and thrust belt. There, natural oil seeps from small carbonate reservoirs located at shallow depths that
have been historically known since the 19th century, and hypothermal water was discovered during
hydrocarbon exploration. From a geological point of view, the study area, extending for about 11 km2,
is characterized with the presence of a complete section of the tectonic units of the southern Apennines
and a complex structural framework that has not yet been fully clariﬁed. In this work, geological
analysis is based on new lithological and structural data, acquired during a detailed geological
survey, compared with well logs obtained during exploration for hydrocarbons. Furthermore, a new
geophysical investigation down to a 1 km depth (deep electrical resistivity tomography) allowed
inference of buried structural and geological characteristics of the studied area. Through combining
surface and subsurface data, some preliminary considerations about the structural setting and
geoﬂuid presence down to a 1 km depth have been made. Furthermore, geological–structural cross-
sections have been constructed with the purpose of depicting the geometries of structures affecting
the Apennine nappe pile in the subsurface, possibly favoring early uprising of hydrocarbons as well
as circulation of hypothermal ﬂuids and associated gases rising from deeper reservoirs."
79,"Geomagnetic and FDEM Methods in the Roman Archaeological Site of Bocca Delle Menate (Comacchio, Italy)","Abstract: The increasing use of geophysical investigations for archaeological purposes is now pro-
vided also by Italian reforms about preventive archaeology. They allow not only the discovery or the
spatial deﬁnition of possible buried archaeological evidence, but they are also able to deﬁne the state
of preservation of ancient structures. The Bocca delle Menate archaeological site is in Comacchio
village territory, situated in Ferrara provence (Emilia Romagna region, Italy). The archeological site
provides important evidence of the Roman presence in the Po Delta (Italy). The Roman villa was
excavated between 1958 and 1959, during the reclaiming works in the Mezzano Valley (Comacchio,
Ferrara). An archaeological preliminary survey and a geophysical ﬁeld trip using Geomagnetic
and Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Methods were carried out, following the aim to identify
the planimetry of the villa previously excavated and eventually newly discovered archaeological
remains. The geomagnetic results detected the archaeological buried structures, even if the original
disposition of them is not completely highlighted. The electromagnetic method was able to depict
the geological and geomorphological background surrounding the Roman villa. The obtained results
highlighted that the applied geophysical methods are excellent tools for the preservation, protection,
and monitoring of archaeological heritage previously excavated, adding to their already known
importance as best tools for new archaeological buried remains detections."
79,A Potential Beach Monitoring Based on Integrated Methods,"Abstract: This study focuses on the analysis of sandy beaches by integrating sedimentological,
geomorphological, and geophysical investigations. The beach represents an extremely variable
environment where different natural processes act simultaneously with human activities, leading to
the gathering of different methodologies of the Earth Sciences to study its evolution in space and time.
The aim of this research is to propose a potential procedure for monitoring the morpho-sedimentary
processes of sandy beaches by analyzing the textural and compositional characteristics of the sands
and quantifying the volumes involved in the coastal dynamics. The study area includes two Apulian
sandy beaches (Torre Guaceto and Le Dune beach) that are representative of the coastal dynamics of
a large sector of the central/northern Mediterranean Sea involving the southern Adriatic Sea and
the northern Ionian Sea. Sedimentological and ecological investigations allowed to describe the
textural and compositional characteristics of the beach sands by interpreting their sand provenance
and the physical/biological interactions within the beach. The topographic surveys carried out with
a Terrestrial Laser Scanner and an Optical Total Station, aimed to quantify the variations of sediment
volume over time, whereas the Delft3d software was applied to analyze the effects of the dominant
wave motion on the sedimentary dynamics. Lastly, the geophysical techniques which included Sub
Bottom Proﬁler procedures, Ground Penetrating Radar investigation, and resistivity models enabled
us to calculate the sand sediment thickness above the bedrock."
79,Geoelectrical Measurements to Monitor a Hydrocarbon Leakage in the Aquifer: Simulation Experiment in the Lab,"Abstract: Hydrocarbons represent one of the most dangerous sources of contamination for environ-
mental resources. Petroleum contaminants released from leaking fuel storage tanks or accidental
spillages represent serious worldwide problems. Knowledge of the contaminant distribution in
the subsoil is very complex, and direct measurements, such as boreholes or drillings, are strongly
required. Even if the direct measurements deﬁne accurate information, on the contrary, they have low
spatial coverage. Geophysics can effectively support conventional methods of subsoil sampling by
expanding the information obtainable, providing to analyze, with higher resolution, larger areas of
investigation. Consequently, different geophysical techniques have been used to detect the presence
and distribution of hydrocarbons in the subsurface. Electrical resistivity tomography is an efﬁcient
geophysical methodology for studying hydrocarbon contamination. Indeed, this methodology allows
for the reduction of the number of drillings or soil samples, and several papers described its success.
One of the advantages is the possibility to successfully perform analyses in time-lapse to identify the
degradation of the contaminants. Indeed, natural attenuation of hydrocarbon contaminants is ob-
served under aerobic conditions due to biodegradation, which should be the principal phenomenon
of physical variations of the subsoil. Therefore, a laboratory experiment was conducted in a sandbox
to simulate a spillage of common diesel occurring in the vadose zone. The sandbox was monitored
for a long period (1 year, approximately) using time-lapse cross borehole electrical resistivity to-
mographies. Results highlight the usefulness of in-hole electrical tomography for characterizing
underground hydrocarbon leakage and the variability of the subsurface physical behavior due to
contaminant degradation. Therefore, the experiment demonstrates how the electrical method can
monitor the biodegradation processes occurring in the subsoil, deﬁning the possibility of using the
methodology during remediation activities."
79,Optimization of Aquifer Monitoring through Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity Tomography Integrated with Machine-Learning and Predictive Algorithms,"Abstract: In this paper, an integrated workﬂow aimed at optimizing aquifer monitoring and man-
agement through time-lapse Electric Resistivity Tomography (TL-ERT) combined with a suite of
predictive algorithms is discussed. First, the theoretical background of this approach is described.
Then, the proposed approach is applied to real geoelectric datasets recorded through experiments
at different spatial and temporal scales. These include a sequence of cross-hole resistivity surveys
aimed at monitoring a tracer diffusion in a real aquifer as well as in a laboratory experimental set.
Multiple predictive methods were applied to both datasets, including Vector Autoregressive (VAR)
and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms, over the entire sequence of ERT monitor surveys.
In both ﬁeld and lab experiments, the goal was to retrieve a determined number of “predicted”
pseudo sections of apparent resistivity values. By inverting both real and predicted datasets, it is
possible to deﬁne a dynamic model of time-space evolution of the water plume contaminated by a
tracer injected into the aquifer system(s). This approach allowed for describing the complex ﬂuid
displacement over time conditioned by the hydraulic properties of the aquifer itself."
79,An Overview on Down-Looking UAV-Based GPR Systems,"Abstract: Radar imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a dynamic research topic attracting
huge interest due to its practical fallouts. In this context, this article provides a comprehensive review
of the current state of the art and challenges related to UAV-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
imaging systems. First, a description of the available prototypes is provided in terms of radar
technology, UAV platforms, and navigation control devices. Afterward, the paper addresses the
main issues affecting the performance of UAV-based GPR imaging systems. such as the control of
the UAV platform during the ﬂight to collect high-quality data, the necessity to provide accurate
platform position information in terms of probing wavelength, and the mitigation of clutter and other
electromagnetic disturbances. A description of the major applicative areas for UAV GPR systems is
reported with the aim to show their potential. Furthermore, the main signal-processing approaches
currently adopted are detailed and two experimental tests are also reported to prove the actual
imaging capabilities. Finally, open challenges and future perspectives regarding this promising
technology are discussed."

Groundwater seepage leads to the formation of theater-headed valleys (THVs) in un­
consolidated sediments. In bedrock, the role of groundwater in THV development remains 
disputed. Here, we integrate field and remote-sensing observations from Gnejna Valley (Mal­
tese Islands) with numerical modeling to demonstrate that groundwater seepage can be the 
main driver of THV formation in jointed limestone overlying clays. The inferred erosion 
mechanisms entail (1) widening of joints and fractures by fluid pressure and dissolution and 
(2) creeping of an underlying clay layer, which lead to slope failure at the valley head and its 
upslope retreat. The latter is slower than the removal of the talus by creep and sliding on the 
valley bed. The location and width of THVs are controlled by the location of the master fault 
and the extent of the damage zone, respectively. The variability of seepage across the fault 
zone determines the shape of the valley head, with an exponential decrease in seepage away 
from the fault giving rise to a theater-shaped head that best matches that of Gnejna Valley. 
Our model may explain the formation of THVs by groundwater in jointed, strong-over-weak 
chemical sedimentary lithologies, particularly in arid terrestrial settings."

80,Enhanced Astronomical Source Classification with,"Abstract
Accurate classification of celestial objects is essential for advancing our under-
standing of the universe. MargNet is a recently developed deep learning-based
classifier applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR16)
dataset to segregate stars, quasars, and compact galaxies using photometric data.
MargNet utilizes a stacked architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) for image modelling and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for
modelling photometric parameters. Notably, MargNet focuses exclusively on com-
pact galaxies and outperforms other methods in classifying compact galaxies
from stars and quasars, even at fainter magnitudes. In this study, we propose
enhancing MargNet’s performance by incorporating attention mechanisms and
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models for processing image data. The attention
mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features and capture intri-
cate patterns within images, effectively distinguishing between different classes of
celestial objects. Additionally, we leverage ViTs, a transformer-based deep learn-
ing architecture renowned for exceptional performance in image classification
tasks. We enhance the model’s understanding of complex astronomical images by
1

utilizing ViT’s ability to capture global dependencies and contextual information.
Our approach uses a curated dataset comprising 240,000 compact and 150,000
faint objects. The models learn classification directly from the data, minimizing
human intervention. Furthermore, we explore ViT as a hybrid architecture that
uses photometric features and images together as input to predict astronomical
objects. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attention mechanism aug-
mented CNN in MargNet marginally outperforms the traditional MargNet and
the proposed ViT-based MargNet models. Additionally, the ViT-based hybrid
model emerges as the most lightweight and easy-to-train model with classifica-
tion accuracy similar to that of the best-performing attention-enhanced MargNet.
This advancement in deep learning will contribute to greater success in identify-
ing objects in upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope."
80,Inpainting the Gaps: A Novel Framework for,"Abstract
The perturbation test remains the go-to evaluation approach for explanation meth-
ods in computer vision. This evaluation method has a major drawback of test-time
distribution shift due to pixel-masking that is not present in the training set. To
overcome this drawback, we propose a novel evaluation framework called Inpaint-
ing the Gaps (InG). Specifically, we propose inpainting parts that constitute partial
or complete objects in an image. In this way, one can perform meaningful image
perturbations with lower test-time distribution shifts, thereby improving the efficacy
of the perturbation test. InG is applied to the PartImageNet dataset to evaluate the
performance of popular explanation methods for three training strategies of the
Vision Transformer (ViT). Based on this evaluation, we found Beyond Intuition
and Generic Attribution to be the two most consistent explanation models. Further,
and interestingly, the proposed framework results in higher and more consistent
evaluation scores across all the ViT models considered in this work. To the best of
our knowledge, InG is the first semi-synthetic framework for the evaluation of ViT
explanation methods.

80,MINIMIZING ENERGY COSTS IN DEEP LEARNING,"ABSTRACT
Computing the loss gradient via backpropagation consumes considerable energy
during deep learning (DL) model training. In this paper, we propose a novel ap-
proach to efficiently compute DL models’ gradients to mitigate the substantial en-
ergy overhead associated with backpropagation. Exploiting the over-parameterized
nature of DL models and the smoothness of their loss landscapes, we propose
a method called GradSamp for sampling gradient updates from a Gaussian dis-
tribution. Specifically, we update model parameters at a given epoch (chosen
periodically or randomly) by perturbing the parameters (element-wise) from the
previous epoch with Gaussian “noise”. The parameters of the Gaussian distribution
are estimated using the error between the model parameter values from the two
previous epochs. GradSamp not only streamlines gradient computation but also en-
ables skipping entire epochs, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. We rigorously
validate our hypothesis across a diverse set of standard and non-standard CNN and
transformer-based models, spanning various computer vision tasks such as image
classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Additionally, we explore
its efficacy in out-of-distribution scenarios such as Domain Adaptation (DA), Do-
main Generalization (DG), and decentralized settings like Federated Learning (FL).
Our experimental results affirm the effectiveness of GradSamp in achieving notable
energy savings without compromising performance, underscoring its versatility
and potential impact in practical DL applications."
80,Augmented Memory Replay-based Continual,"Abstract
Intrusion detection is a form of anomalous activity detection in communication
network traffic. Continual learning (CL) approaches to the intrusion detection task
accumulate old knowledge while adapting to the latest threat knowledge. Previous
works have shown the effectiveness of memory replay-based CL approaches for this
task. In this work, we present two novel contributions to improve the performance
of CL-based network intrusion detection in the context of class imbalance and
scalability. First, we extend class balancing reservoir sampling (CBRS), a memory-
based CL method, to address the problems of severe class imbalance for large
datasets. Second, we propose a novel approach titled perturbation assistance for
parameter approximation (PAPA) based on the Gaussian mixture model to reduce
the number of virtual stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter computations
needed to discover maximally interfering samples for CL. We demonstrate that
the proposed approaches perform remarkably better than the baselines on standard
intrusion detection benchmarks created over shorter periods (KDDCUP’99, NSL-
KDD, CICIDS-2017/2018, UNSW-NB15, and CTU-13) and a longer period with
distribution shift (AnoShift). We also validated proposed approaches on standard
continual learning benchmarks (SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and CLEAR-10/100) and
anomaly detection benchmarks (SMAP, SMD, and MSL). Further, the proposed
PAPA approach significantly lowers the number of virtual SGD update operations,
thus resulting in training time savings in the range of 12 to 40% compared to the
maximally interfered samples retrieval algorithm.

80,Are Deep Learning Models Pre-trained on RGB Data Good Enough for RGB-Thermal Image Retrieval?,"Abstract
RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image retrieval is crucial in
scenarios where RGB data alone is insufficient for reli-
able decision-making. These include all-day, all-weather
surveillance and security operations, search and rescue op-
erations and autonomous navigation systems.
However,
RGB-T image retrieval remains underexplored due to the
nature of the currently available datasets.
Specifically,
these datasets do not lend themselves to training models
in the standard RGB visual place recognition (VPR) set-
ting. Therefore, we explore and analyse the effectiveness
of existing RGB pre-trained models in addressing the RGB-
T image retrieval problem. In particular, we evaluate the
performance of numerous pre-trained models on the RGB-
T image retrieval task. The efficacy of the models is evalu-
ated on eight RGB-T datasets. Quantitatively, recall rates,
Central Kernel Alignment (CKA), and the proposed cen-
troid condition are used for evaluation. Qualitative analysis
uses distance plots, t-SNE plots and heatmaps like Saliency
Based Similarity Maps (SBSM). Interestingly, and surpris-
ingly, some of the pre-trained models deliver good cross-
domain retrieval performance. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this analysis is the first of its kind in RGB-T image
retrieval with the available RGB-T datasets. We believe this
will serve as a baseline for future work in this area of re-
search."
80,Perceptually-Inspired Local Source Normalization for Adversarial Robustness,"ABSTRACT
The importance of the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs)
cannot be overemphasised due to their widespread use in safety-
critical applications. However, the fragility of DNNs to impercepti-
ble input perturbations is well-known in the literature. This fragility
has led to the design of several attack and defense mechanisms
aimed at building robust DNNs. The imperceptibility of adversarial
DNN attacks motivated us to draw inspiration from the robust func-
tioning of the human visual system (HVS). Specifically, we propose
HVS-inspired local source normalisation as a simple yet effective
technique to build robust DNNs. The efficacy of our method against
classical and state-of-the-art attacks is demonstrated quantitatively
and qualitatively. We apply the proposed method to popular DNNs
such as ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and WideResNet-22-10 on the CIFAR-
10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, and demonstrate quantitative improve-
ment in accuracy for a majority of cases. Qualitatively, we analyze
feature representations and class activation maps to highlight better
feature separation, especially at higher attack levels. The proposed
approach is simple, has few parameters, is attack-agnostic and can
be adopted as a pre-processing technique for training DNNs.

80,"JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 1","Abstract—It is well known that carefully crafted imperceptible
perturbations can cause state-of-the-art deep learning classiﬁca-
tion models to misclassify. Understanding and analyzing these
adversarial perturbations play a crucial role in the design of ro-
bust convolutional neural networks. However, their mechanics are
not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the
mechanics by systematically answering the following question:
do imperceptible adversarial perturbations focus on changing
the regions of the image that are important for classiﬁcation?
In other words, are imperceptible adversarial perturbations se-
mantically explainable? Most current methods use lp distance to
generate and characterize the imperceptibility of the adversarial
perturbations. However, since lp distances only measure the pixel
to pixel distances and do not consider the structure in the image,
these methods do not provide a satisfactory answer to the above
question. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
for generating adversarial perturbations by explicitly incorpo-
rating a “perceptual quality ball” constraint in our formulation.
Speciﬁcally, we pose the adversarial example generation problem
as a tractable convex optimization problem, with constraints
taken from a mathematically amenable variant of the popular
SSIM index. We use the MobileNetV2 network trained on the
ImageNet dataset for our experiments. By comparing the SSIM
maps generated by our method with class activation maps,
we show that the perceptually guided perturbations introduce
changes speciﬁcally in the regions that contribute to classiﬁcation
decisions i.e., these perturbations are semantically explainable."
80,DISCRETE CONTROL IN REAL-WORLD DRIVING,"ABSTRACT
Training self-driving cars is often challenging since they require a vast amount of labeled data in
multiple real-world contexts, which is computationally and memory intensive. Researchers often re-
sort to driving simulators to train the agent and transfer the knowledge to a real-world setting. Since
simulators lack realistic behavior, these methods are quite inefﬁcient. To address this issue, we
introduce a framework (perception, planning, and control) in a real-world driving environment that
transfers the real-world environments into gaming environments by setting up a reliable Markov De-
cision Process (MDP). We propose variations of existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms
in a multi-agent setting to learn and execute the discrete control in real-world environments. Experi-
ments show that the multi-agent setting outperforms the single-agent setting in all the scenarios. We
also propose reliable initialization, data augmentation, and training techniques that enable the agents
to learn and generalize to navigate in a real-world environment with minimal input video data, and
with minimal training. Additionally, to show the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorithm, we deploy our
method in the virtual driving environment TORCS.

80,Cosmic Ray Detection in Astronomical Images via,"Abstract—In this work, we propose a novel Dictionary Learn-
ing (DL) based framework to detect Cosmic Ray (CR) hits that
contaminate the astronomical images obtained through optical
photometric surveys. The unique and distinguishable spatial
signatures of CR hits compared to other actual astrophysical
sources in the image motivated us to characterize the CR patches
uniquely via their sparse representations obtained from a learned
dictionary. Specifically, the dictionary is trained on images
acquired from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations.
Next, the learned dictionary is used to represent the CR and
Non-CR patches (e.g., each patch is with 11×11 pixel resolution)
extracted from the original images. A Machine Learning (ML)
classifier is then trained to classify the CR and Non-CR patches.
Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed DL-based method
can detect the CR hits at patch level and provide approximately
83% detection rates at 0.1 % false positives on the DECam
test data with Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Further, we
used the coarse segmentation maps obtained from the classifier
output to guide the deep-learning-based CR segmentation models.
The coarse maps are fed through a separate channel along
with the contaminated image to detect the CR-induced pixels
more accurately. We evaluated the performance of proposed
DL-guided deep segmentation models over the baseline on test
data from DECam. We demonstrate that the proposed method
provides additional guidance to the baseline models in terms of
faster convergence rate and improves CR detection performance
by 2% in the case of shallow models. We made our dataset
and models available at https://github.com/lfovia/Dictionary-

80,Cosmic Ray rejection with attention augmented deep learning,"Abstract
Cosmic Ray (CR) hits are the major contaminants in astronomical imaging and spectroscopic observations involving solid-
state detectors. Correctly identifying and masking them is a crucial part of the image processing pipeline, since it may otherwise
lead to spurious detections. For this purpose, we have developed and tested a novel Deep Learning based framework for the
automatic detection of CR hits from astronomical imaging data from two diﬀerent imagers: Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and
Las Cumbers Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT). We considered two baseline models namely deepCR and Cosmic-CoNN,
which are the current state-of-the-art learning based algorithms that were trained using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC
and LCOGT Network images respectively. We have experimented with the idea of augmenting the baseline models using Attention
Gates (AGs) to improve the CR detection performance. We have trained our models on DECam data and demonstrate a consistent
marginal improvement by adding AGs in True Positive Rate (TPR) at 0.01% False Positive Rate (FPR) and Precision at 95% TPR
over the aforementioned baseline models for the DECam data set. We demonstrate that the proposed AG augmented models
provide signiﬁcant gain in TPR at 0.01% FPR when tested on previously unseen LCO test data having images from three
distinct telescope classes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed baseline models with and without attention augmentation
outperform state-of-the-art models such as Astro-SCRAPPY, Maximask (that is trained natively on DECam data) and pre-trained
ground-based Cosmic-CoNN. This study demonstrates that the AG module augmentation enables us to get a better deepCR
and Cosmic-CoNN models and to improve their generalization capability on unseen data."
80,A Cross-Platform HD Dataset and a Two-Step Framework for Robust Aerial Image Matching,"ABSTRACT Image matching has been an active research area in the computer vision community over
the past decades. Signiﬁcant advances in image matching algorithms have attracted attention from many
emerging applications. However, aerial image matching remains demanding due to the variety of airborne
platforms and onboard electro-optic sensors, long operational ranges, limited datasets and resources, and
constrained operating environments. We present two contributions in this work to overcome these challenges:
a) an upgraded cross-platform image dataset built over images taken from an aircraft and satellite and b) a
two-step cross-platform image matching framework. Our dataset considers several practical scenarios in
cross-platform matching and semantic segmentation. The ﬁrst step in our two-step matching framework
performs coarse-matching using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with help from aircraft
instantaneous parameters. In the second step, we ﬁne-tune standard off-the-shelf image matching algorithms
by exploiting spectral, temporal and ﬂow features followed by cluster analysis. We validate our proposed
matching framework over our dataset, two publicly available aerial cross-platform datasets, and a derived
dataset using various standard evaluation methodologies. Speciﬁcally, we show that both steps in our
proposed two-step framework help to improve the matching performance in the cross-platform image
matching scenario."
80,1,"Abstract—Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, and in
part its effective diagnosis and treatment depend on the accurate
delineation of the tumor. Human-centered segmentation, which is
currently the most common approach, is subject to inter-observer
variability, and is also time-consuming, considering the fact that
only experts are capable of providing annotations. Automatic
and semi-automatic tumor segmentation methods have recently
shown promising results. However, as different researchers have
validated their algorithms using various datasets and perfor-
mance metrics, reliably evaluating these methods is still an open
challenge. The goal of the Lung-Originated Tumor Segmentation
from Computed Tomography Scan (LOTUS) Benchmark created
through 2018 IEEE Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup
competition, is to provide a unique dataset and pre-deﬁned
metrics, so that different researchers can develop and evaluate
their methods in a uniﬁed fashion. The 2018 VIP Cup started with
a global engagement from 42 countries to access the competition
data. At the registration stage, there were 129 members clustered
into 28 teams from 10 countries, out of which 9 teams made it
to the ﬁnal stage and 6 teams successfully completed all the
required tasks. In a nutshell, all the algorithms proposed during
the competition, are based on deep learning models combined
with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by
the three ﬁnalists show promising results in tumor segmentation,
however, more effort should be put into reducing the false positive
rate. This competition manuscript presents an overview of the
VIP-Cup challenge, along with the proposed algorithms and
results."
80,On Handling Class Imbalance in Continual Learning based Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Abstract
Modern-day cyber threats are growing more rapidly than ever be-
fore. To effectively defend against them, Anomaly-based Network
intrusion detection systems (A-NIDS) must evolve continuously.
Traditional machine learning techniques are ineffective in handling
sequentially evolving tasks, and Neural Networks (NNs) in partic-
ular suffer from Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) of old tasks when
trained on new ones. Continual Learning (CL) strategies help to
mitigate CF by imposing constraints while training NNs on sequen-
tially evolving data like network traffic. However, applying the CL
framework in the design of A-NIDS is not straightforward due to
the heavy Class Imbalance (CI) in the network traffic datasets. As
a result, the performance of the system is very sensitive to the task
execution order. In this work, we proposed a CL based A-NIDS by
applying sample replay with Class Balancing Reservoir Sampling
(CBRS) to mitigate CI in a Class Incremental Setting (CIS). Using
the CICIDS-2017 dataset, experiments are conducted by permuting
the majority class across the different task execution orders using the
proposed CL based A-NIDS. We found that using auxiliary memory
with context-aware sample replacing strategies, CF can be reduced to
a greater extent, as opposed to data augmentation techniques which
may alter the original data distribution and increase training time
(with oversampling methods)."

In this work, we address the problem of full-reference video
quality prediction.
To address this problem, we rely on
deep learning based spatio-temporal representations of nat-
ural videos. Speciﬁcally, we use feature representations de-
rived from a per-voxel deep learning regression model. This
model predicts the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) responses of the visual cortical regions to natural
video stimuli.
We construct a rudimentary full-reference
spatio-temporal quality feature that is simply the L1-norm of
the error between the voxel model’s response to the reference
and test video stimuli. This feature is shown to correlate well
with subjective quality scores. Additionally, we rely on the
Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index as the
spatial quality feature. We show that the combination of the
proposed spatio-temporal feature and the spatial (MS-SSIM)
feature delivers competitive performance for both Quality of
Experience (QoE) prediction and Video Quality Assessment
(VQA) tasks. This ﬁnding not only provides corroborative
evidence to previous results based on electroencephalograph
(EEG) signals on the role of the visual cortex in quality
prediction but also opens up interesting directions for percep-
tually inspired design of objective video quality metrics."
80,PROCEEDINGS OF SPIE,"ABSTRACT
Ultrasound transducers used in photoacoustic imaging are bandlimited and have a limited detection angle,
which degrades the reconstructed image quality. One way to address this problem is to have transducers with
multiple frequency bands with acquisition around the sample. This approach is expensive and it is not feasible
for systems with a handheld probe using a linear transducer array. In this work, we aim to develop a deep
learning method for photoacoustic reconstruction from bandlimited and limited-view data. We have developed
a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based framework conditioned with a photoacoustic measurement
for image reconstruction. In this way, the transducer used in the measurement can be incorporated and the
generator trying to compensate for the limited data problem. We have developed the model for a handheld
photoacoustic system using a linear transducer array with 128 elements having a center frequency of 7MHz
and -6dB bandwidth from 4-10 MHz. We trained the network using simulated blood vessel images and tested
it on in vivo measurements from the human forearm. We have compared the reconstructed images using the
proposed method with the time-reversal on simulated data for detection using a bandlimited and directional
transducer and compared it using the ground truth. Further, we compare our results to the in vivo images from
the system which uses a delay and sum algorithm. The results from both simulations and experiments show
that the proposed approach can remove bandlimited and limited view artifacts and can achieve a better image
quality."
80,Aerial Cross-Platform Path Planning Dataset,"Abstract
Self-localisation mechanism in an unknown territory has
been an interest area for humans since ages. Image match-
ing is an obvious contender due to advancements in imaging
devices and compute technologies. Deep learning methods
have proven to be state-of-art in recent times but require
large volumes of relevant data. Aerial image matching re-
mains a challenging task due to the quality of images (e.g.
platform disturbances, atmospheric effects), multiple types
of on-board sensors (e.g. visual, thermal), variations in
scales and look angles etc. To address these challenges,
we present a cross-platform path planning dataset com-
posed of images acquired from an aircraft and the Google
Earth Engine (GEE). The proposed dataset contains manu-
ally aligned frames, corresponding match region, and se-
mantic labeling of the images.
Multiple galleries repre-
senting historical and instantaneous paths are generated.
Our dataset envisages several realistic scenarios in cross-
platform matching and semantic segmentation. We eval-
uate the performance of state-of-the-art image matching
and segmentation algorithms on the proposed dataset. We
will make our dataset freely available at https://www.
iith.ac.in/˜lfovia/downloads.html. Further,
a case study on utilizing an existing open-source dataset for
cross-platform path planning is also presented."
80,Lqaid: Localized Quality Aware Image Denoising Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose the Localized Quality Aware Im-
age Denoising (LQAID) technique for image denoising using
deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). LQAID relies
on local quality estimates over global cues like noise standard
deviation since the perceptual quality of a noisy image is typ-
ically spatially varying. Speciﬁcally, we use localized quality
maps generated using DistNet, a spatial quality map estima-
tion method. These quality maps are used to augment the
noisy image and guide the denoising process. The augmented
noisy image is denoised using a deep fully convolutional net-
work (FCN) trained using mean square error (MSE) as the
loss function. The proposed approach shows state-of-the-art
performance both qualitatively and quantitatively on two vi-
sion datasets: TID 2008 and BSD500. We also show that the
proposed approach possesses excellent generalization ability.
Lastly, the proposed approach is completely blind since it nei-
ther requires information about the strength of the additive
noise nor does it try to explicitly estimate it."

80,DEEP NO-REFERENCE TONE MAPPED IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT,"ABSTRACT
The process of rendering high dynamic range (HDR) images
to be viewed on conventional displays is called tone mapping.
However, tone mapping introduces distortions in the ﬁnal im-
age which may lead to visual displeasure. To quantify these
distortions, we introduce a novel no-reference quality assess-
ment technique for these tone mapped images. This technique
is composed of two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we employ a con-
volutional neural network (CNN) to generate quality aware
maps (also known as distortion maps) from tone mapped im-
ages by training it with the ground truth distortion maps. In
the second stage, we model the normalized image and distor-
tion maps using an Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian Dis-
tribution (AGGD). The parameters of the AGGD model are
then used to estimate the quality score using support vector
regression (SVR). We show that the proposed technique de-
livers competitive performance relative to the state-of-the-art
techniques. The novelty of this work is its ability to visualize
various distortions as quality maps (distortion maps), espe-
cially in the no-reference setting, and to use these maps as
features to estimate the quality score of tone mapped images."

82,Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,"Abstract
Pathological low birth weight ‘fetal growth restriction’ (FGR) is an important predictor of adverse obstetric
outcomes including stillbirth. It is more common amongst native lowlanders when gestating in the hypoxic
environment of high altitude, whilst populations who have resided at high altitude for many generations are
relatively protected. Genetic study of pregnant populations at high altitude allows for exploration of the
hypoxic influence on FGR pathogenesis.
Pregnant women were recruited from Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, Ladakh between February 2017-
January 2019 in this study. Principal component, admixture and genome wide association analysis (GWAS)
were applied on umbilical cord blood DNA samples from 316 neonates, to explore ancestry and the genetic
influence on low birth weight.
Our findings support Tibetan ancestry in the Ladakhi population, with subsequent admixture with
neighboring Indo-Aryan populations. Fetal growth protection was evident in Ladakhi neonates. Seven loci
from five different genomic regions (ZBTB38, ZFP36L2, HMGA2, CDKAL1, PLCG1) previously associated
with birthweight, were likewise similarly associated here.
In summary, the Ladakhi population show evidence of enrichment of variants in genes that may help
mitigate altitude-associated fetal growth restriction, supporting novel biological pathways and therapeutic
targets for FGR, worthy of further investigation."
82,Avian Atlas: Unveiling the Diversity Divide in Desert Realms between Tropics,"Abstract
4
Understanding diversity gradients across global deserts remains a signifi-
5
cant challenge. The unique characteristics of deserts complicate conservation
6
efforts for these biomes, which are highly affected by climate change. Here,
7
we conduct a comprehensive study of ecological traits to determine the be-
8
havior and uniqueness of avian communities in ten major tropical deserts,
9
using crowd-sourced avian diversity data from GBIF.org as a key analytical
10
tool. Our results reveal significant variations in bird diversity among trop-
11
ical deserts, with heightened diversity in deserts near the Tropic of Cancer
12
(TCan) compared to those near the Tropic of Capricorn (TCap).
13
The analysis of ecological traits indicates that, unlike TCap deserts, TCan
14
deserts have a higher prevalence of migratory species. This is facilitated by
15
a broader niche breadth among sedentary bird species, which reduces niche
16
competition and allows the influx of migratory invertivores. This study is the
17
first to identify a differential avian diversity gradient within tropical deserts,
18
demonstrating that avian species richness in deserts is more closely linked to
19
tropical locations than to realm classifications.
20
Recognizing the vulnerability of TCap deserts and the diverse trophic
21
roles played by avian species, our analysis underscores the need for tar-
22
geted conservation strategies. Protecting the unique avian diversity in TCan
23
deserts and mitigating extinction risks in TCap deserts are essential steps to
24
ensure the resilience and sustainability of these critical ecosystems.

82,Wastelands or Preferred-lands? Indicators for redefining Desert conservation,"Abstract
4
Desert ecosystems though crucial in shaping global climate, are often per-
ceived to have limited function and are frequently designated as wastelands
due to low biotic diversity and abundance. We explore the functional prop-
erties of desert through assessment of spatio-temporal variations of avian
species richness and insect abundance of the relatively understudied Thar
in Rajasthan. The study was conducted across four contrasting ecoregions
(Western Thar (WT), Eastern Thar (ET), Transitional Zone (TZ), and Culti-
vated Zone (CZ) spanning 33 counties of Rajasthan. Monthly avian diversity
were obtained from crowdsourced eBird data. Insect diversity and abundance
accross the ecoregions were curated from the annual surveys of ZSI, India.
The leads were corroborated with five years feeding behaviour observational
data recorded from a representative site spanning 852 acres. There was a sig-
nificant seasonal differences in bird species richness between the ecoregions
with the most pronounced variations between summer and winter and CZ
exhibiting the highest spatial variability followed by WT. WT also recorded
the highest insect diversity and abundance, especially the orders Orthoptera,
Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidotera and Diptera. The correlation matrix
between bird and insect abundance and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
plot indicated the relation between diverse dietary preferences and migra-
tory patterns.
These observations challenge the conventional notion that
resource-limited environments harbour lesser biodiversity especially in arid
environments. The dominance of insectivory among winter migrants aligns
with the higher density of resident arthropods and emphasizes the pivotal
role of insects as a food source during the migratory period. The adaptability

Objective  Alu repeats have gained huge importance in the creation and modification of regulatory networks. We 
previously reported a unique isoform of human CYP20A1 i.e. CYP20A1_Alu-LT with 23 Alu repeats exonized in its 
9 kb long 3’UTR with 4742 potential binding sites for 994 miRNAs. The role of this transcript was hypothesized as a 
potential miRNA sponge in primary neurons as its expression correlated with that of 380 genes having shared miRNA 
sites and enriched in neuro-coagulopathy. This study provides experimental evidence for the miRNA sponge activity 
of CYP20A1_Alu-LT in neuronal cell lines.
Results  We studied the Alu-rich fragment of the CYP20A1_Alu-LT extended 3’UTR with > 10 binding sites for 
miR-619-5p and miR-3677-3p. Enrichment of the Alu-rich fragment with Ago2 confirmed miRNA association of 
this transcript. Cloning the fragment downstream of a reporter gene led to a 90% decrease in luciferase activity. 
Overexpression and knockdown studies revealed a positive correlation between the expression of CYP20A1_Alu-LT 
and miR-619-5p / miR-3677-3p target genes. GAP43, one of the key modulators of nerve regeneration, was 
significantly altered by the expression of CYP20A1_Alu-LT. This study, for the first time, provides evidence for a unique 
regulatory function of exonized Alu repeats as miRNA sponges."

In today’s globalized and flat world, a patient can access and seek multiple health and disease
management options. A digitally enabled participatory framework that allows an evidence-based
informed choice is likely to assume an immense importance in the future. In India, traditional
knowledge systems, like Ayurveda, coexist with modern medicine. However, due to limited
crosstalk between the clinicians of both disciplines, a patient attempts integrative medicine by
seeking both options independently with limited understanding and evidence. There is a need
for an integrative medicine platform with a formalized approach, which allows practitioners
from the two diverse systems to crosstalk, coexist, and coevolve for an informed cross-referral
that benefits the patients. To be successful, this needs frameworks that enable the bridging of
disciplines through a common interface with shared ontologies. Ayurgenomics is an emerging
discipline that explores the principles and practices of Ayurveda combined with genomics
approaches for mainstream integration. The present review highlights how in conjunction with
different disciplines and technologies this has provided frameworks for (1) the discovery of
molecular correlates to build ontological links between the two systems, (2) the discovery of
biomarkers and targets for early actionable interventions, (3) understanding molecular mech-
anisms of drug action from its usage perspective in Ayurveda with applications in repurposing,
(4) understanding the network and P4 medicine perspective of Ayurveda through a common
organizing principle, (5) non-invasive stratification of healthy and diseased individuals using a
compendium of system-level phenotypes, and (6) developing evidence-based solutions for
practice in integrative medicine settings. The concordance between the two contrasting streams
has been built through extensive explorations and iterations of the concepts of Ayurveda and
genomic observations using state-of-the-art technologies, computational approaches, and
model system studies. These highlight the enormous potential of a trans-disciplinary approach
in evolving solutions for personalized interventions in integrative medicine settings.
Impact statement
Globally, there has been a significant shift in healthcare from a reactive to a proactive approach
with an emphasis on P4 (Preventive, Predictive, Personalized, and Participatory) and precision
medicine. Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine, has been practicing this approach for
thousands of years, but its integration with modern medicine in clinical settings is still limited.
Currently, individuals who want to avail of both systems do so independently without an
evidence-based informed choice. The two medical streams have different approaches to diag-
nosis, treatment, and therapy. Modern medicine focuses on treating diseases in an organ-specific
manner, while Ayurveda takes a holistic perspective, treating the individual in a personalized
manner based on their inherent constitution type “Prakriti.” Ayurvedic medicines consist of
complex herbal formulations, different from modern medicine drugs that often prioritize active
principles. Both systems have their merits, but they currently do not have much cross-commu-
nication or collaboration. A dialogue between Ayurveda and modern medicine can offer patients
more options for managing their health. The emerging field of Ayurgenomics shows promise in
bridging the two contrasting disciplines of medicine. Research in this area over the last two
decades has provided a unifying ontological framework to explore the molecular basis of
principles and practices. These have provided (a) a molecular basis of inter-individual differ-
ences between Prakriti that govern their differential health and disease trajectories, (b) methods
for phenotype-based non-invasive methods of stratification of healthy individuals, (c) biomark-
ers and targets for early actionable interventions, and (d) platforms for evidence-based usage of
Ayurvedic medicines. By combining the strengths of Ayurveda and modern medicine through
Ayurgenomics, there is potential to enhance patient care and promote a more precise, integra-
tive, and effective healthcare system that embraces preventive, predictive, personalized, and
participatory aspects.

Abstract 
Extreme complexity in the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) system and its nomenclature makes it difficult to 
interpret and integrate relevant information for HLA associations with diseases, Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and 
Transplantation. PubMed search displays ~ 146,000 studies on HLA reported from diverse locations. Currently, IPD-
IMGT/HLA (Robinson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 48:D948–D955, 2019) database houses data on 28,320 HLA alleles. 
We developed an automated pipeline with a unified graphical user interface HLA-SPREAD that provides a structured 
information on SNPs, Populations, REsources, ADRs and Diseases information. Information on HLA was extracted from 
~ 28 million PubMed abstracts extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Python scripts were used to mine 
and curate information on diseases, filter false positives and categorize to 24 tree hierarchical groups and named 
Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms followed by semantic analysis to infer HLA association(s). This resource from 109 
countries and 40 ethnic groups provides interesting insights on: markers associated with allelic/haplotypic associa-
tion in autoimmune, cancer, viral and skin diseases, transplantation outcome and ADRs for hypersensitivity. Summary 
information on clinically relevant biomarkers related to HLA disease associations with mapped susceptible/risk alleles 
are readily retrievable from HLASPREAD. The resource is available at URL http://​hla-​spread.​igib.​res.​in/. This resource is 
first of its kind that can help uncover novel patterns in HLA gene-disease associations."
82,Heart rate variability during head‐up tilt shows inter‐individual differences among healthy individuals of extreme Prakriti types,"Abstract
Autonomic modulation is critical during various physiological activities, includ-
ing orthostatic stimuli and primarily evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV). 
Orthostatic stress affects people differently suggesting the possibility of iden-
tification of predisposed groups to autonomic dysfunction-­related disorders 
in a healthy state. One way to understand this kind of variability is by using 
Ayurvedic approach that classifies healthy individuals into Prakriti types based 
on clinical phenotypes. To this end, we explored the differential response to or-
thostatic stress in different Prakriti types using HRV. HRV was measured in 379 
subjects(Vata = 97, Pitta = 68, Kapha = 68, and Mixed Prakriti = 146) from two 
geographical regions(Vadu and Delhi NCR) for 5 min supine (baseline), 3 min 
head-­up-­tilt (HUT) at 60°, and 5 min resupine. We observed that Kapha group 
had lower baseline HRV than other two groups, although not statistically sig-
nificant. The relative change (%Δ1&2) in various HRV parameters in response to 
HUT was although minimal in Kapha group. Kapha also had significantly lower

Mapping of somatic variations has enabled understanding the progression of clonal variations from 
healthy skin to cutaneous malignancies. Highlighting, the adaptive nature of pigmentation, germline 
mutations in albinism amplify skin cancer susceptibility. However, lower incidence of non-melanoma 
skin cancer among subjects with acquired depigmenting skin disorder vitiligo is enigmatic and a matter 
of longstanding debate. To address this, we performed high-coverage exome sequencing of matched 
non-lesional and lesional vitiligo skin along with whole blood to account for germline variations. Our 
analysis suggests lower burden of somatic cancer-associated variations in exposed depigmented lesional 
skin compared to the non-lesional skin. A detailed investigation of vitiligo skin transcriptome reveals 
elevation of DNA repair and cell-proliferation pathways. Validation by comet-assay for DNA damage 
and cell cycle analysis of epidermal cells suggest undamaged DNA in vitiligo lesions that could be 
attributed to higher proliferation-coupled repair. Endorsing this, UV-signature variations are not 
prominent, instead SBS5 associated with endogenous mutational processes is conspicuous in both the 
vitiligo tissues. Our systematic pilot study indicates lower somatic mutation burden in vitiligo skin and 
supports the earlier demographic observation on lower risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in vitiligo 
subjects, providing an opportunity to learn strategies for cancer prevention from vitiligo. 
 
Brief Summary 
Vitiligo skin harbors decreased somatic variation burden in cancer-associated genes and a concomitant 
augmentation in DNA repair response, explaining the lower incidence of cutaneous malignancies.

82,Whole Exome Sequencing in Healthy Individuals of Extreme Constitution Types Reveals Differential Disease Risk: A Novel Approach towards Predictive Medicine,"Abstract: Precision medicine aims to move from traditional reactive medicine to a system where risk
groups can be identiﬁed before the disease occurs. However, phenotypic heterogeneity amongst
the diseased and healthy poses a major challenge for identiﬁcation markers for risk stratiﬁcation
and early actionable interventions. In Ayurveda, individuals are phenotypically stratiﬁed into seven
constitution types based on multisystem phenotypes termed “Prakriti”. It enables the prediction of
health and disease trajectories and the selection of health interventions. We hypothesize that exome
sequencing in healthy individuals of phenotypically homogeneous Prakriti types might enable the
identiﬁcation of functional variations associated with the constitution types. Exomes of 144 healthy
Prakriti stratiﬁed individuals and controls from two genetically homogeneous cohorts (north and
western India) revealed differential risk for diseases/traits like metabolic disorders, liver diseases, and
body and hematological measurements amongst healthy individuals. These SNPs differ signiﬁcantly
from the Indo-European background control as well. Amongst these we highlight novel SNPs
rs304447 (IFIT5) and rs941590 (SERPINA10) that could explain differential trajectories for immune
response, bleeding or thrombosis. Our method demonstrates the requirement of a relatively smaller
sample size for a well powered study. This study highlights the potential of integrating a unique
phenotyping approach for the identiﬁcation of predictive markers and the at-risk population amongst
the healthy."

Actively retrotransposing primate-speciﬁc Alu re-
peats display insertion-deletion (InDel) polymor-

global datasets, Indian populations remain under-
represented and so do their Alu InDels. Here, we
report the genomic landscape of Alu InDels from
the recently released 1021 Indian Genomes (IndiGen)
(available at https://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen). We
identiﬁed 9239 polymorphic Alu insertions that in-
clude private (3831), rare (3974) and common (1434)
insertions with an average of 770 insertions per indi-
vidual. We achieved an 89% PCR validation of the pre-
dicted genotypes in 94 samples tested. About 60%
of identiﬁed InDels are unique to IndiGen when com-
pared to other global datasets; 23% of sites were
shared with both SGDP and HGSVC; among these,
58% (1289 sites) were common polymorphisms in In-
diGen. The insertions not only show a bias for genic
regions, with a preference for introns but also for
the associated genes showing enrichment for pro-
cesses like cell morphogenesis and neurogenesis (P-
value < 0.05). Approximately, 60% of InDels mapped
to genes present in the OMIM database. Finally, we
show that 558 InDels can serve as ancestry informa-
tive markers to segregate global populations. This

Background:  COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with severe acute hypoxia, sepsis-like states, thrombosis 
and chronic sequelae including persisting hypoxia and fibrosis. The molecular hypoxia response pathway has been 
associated with such pathologies and our recent observations on anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of whole 
aqueous extract of Adhatoda Vasica (AV) prompted us to explore its effects on relevant preclinical mouse models.
Methods:  In this study, we tested the effect of whole aqueous extract of AV, in murine models of bleomycin induced 
pulmonary fibrosis, Cecum Ligation and Puncture (CLP) induced sepsis, and siRNA induced hypoxia-thrombosis phe-
notype. The effect on lung of AV treated naïve mice was also studied at transcriptome level. We also determined if the 
extract may have any effect on SARS-CoV2 replication.
Results:  Oral administration AV extract attenuates increased airway inflammation, levels of transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1), IL-6, HIF-1α and improves the overall survival rates of mice in the models of pulmonary fibrosis 
and sepsis and rescues the siRNA induced inflammation and associated blood coagulation phenotypes in mice. We 
observed downregulation of hypoxia, inflammation, TGF-β1, and angiogenesis genes and upregulation of adaptive 
immunity-related genes in the lung transcriptome. AV treatment also reduced the viral load in Vero cells infected with 
SARS-CoV2.
Conclusion:  Our results provide a scientific rationale for this ayurvedic herbal medicine in ameliorating the hypoxia-
hyperinflammation features and highlights the repurposing potential of AV in COVID-19-like conditions."

Severe asthma is a chronic airway disease that exhibits poor response to conventional asthma 
30 
therapies. Growing evidence suggests that elevated hypoxia increases the severity of asthmatic 
31 
inflammation among patients and in model systems. In this study, we elucidate the therapeutic 
32 
effects and mechanistic basis of Adhatoda Vasica  (AV) aqueous extract on mouse models of 
33 
acute allergic as well as severe asthma subtypes at physiological, histopathological, and 
34 
molecular levels. Oral administration of AV extract attenuates the increased airway resistance 
35 
and inflammation in acute allergic asthmatic mice and alleviates the molecular signatures of 
36 
steroid (dexamethasone) resistance like IL-17A, KC, and HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor-
37 
1alpha) in severe asthmatic mice. AV inhibits HIF-1α levels through restoration of expression of 
38 
its negative regulator-PHD2 (prolyl hydroxylase domain-2). Alleviation of hypoxic response 
39 
mediated by AV is further confirmed in the acute and severe asthma model. AV reverses cellular 
40 
hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human bronchial epithelial cells - evident from 
41 
bioenergetic profiles and morphological analysis of mitochondria. In silico docking of AV 
42 
constituents reveal higher negative binding affinity for C and O- glycosides  for HIF-1α, IL-6, 
43 
Janus kinase 1/3, TNF-α and TGF-β -key players of hypoxia-inflammation. This study for the first 
44 
time  provides a molecular basis of action and effect of AV whole extract that is widely  used in 
45 
Ayurveda practice for diverse respiratory ailments.  Further, through its effect on hypoxia-induced 
46 
mitochondrial dysfunction, the study highlights its potential to treat severe steroid-resistant 
47 
asthma.

Significance Statement  
49 
Severe asthma is a global health concern with a large fraction unresponsive to current treatment 
50 
modalities involving corticosteroids. Recent findings suggest that elevated hypoxia has a critical 
51 
role in severity of asthma. Here, we report therapeutic treatment with aqueous extract 
52 
of Adhatoda Vasica (AV), an ayurvedic medicine, attenuates severe steroid insensitive asthmatic 
53 
features in mice. The observed effects of AV are through inhibition of hypoxic response, both in 
54 
 
 
4 
 
vivo and in vitro. AV also reverses mitochondrial dysfunction, a key consequence associated with 
55 
hypoxia, and asthma. This study highlights the translational potential of AV for the treatment of 
56 
severe asthma  and provides opportunities for its usage in other disease conditions where 
57 
hypoxia is pertinent.

82,Traditional use of Cissampelos pareira L. for hormone disorder and fever provides molecular links of ESR1 modulation to viral inhibition,"Abstract: 
In traditional systems, a single herbal formulation is often used in the treatment of 
diverse diseases, including some that are newly emergent and prevalent today. We 
provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a 
multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment 
of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit 
downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa 
potentially bind (∆G< -7.5) with ERα at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome 
signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation 
inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This 
includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity 
score > 99.92.  This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient 
transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the 
DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2 
replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. A few of its prominent 
pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% 
inhibition.  This study provides a novel framework for querying the molecular links 
of multicomponent Ayurveda formulations and explains their use in the treatment of 
disparate diseases. The novel biological targets identified here can become potential 
that could be applicable to more than one viral infection, such as the use of Cipa in 
dengue and COVID-19."

GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT"
83,Nanophotonic Crystal Waveguide With Embedded Piezoresistor on MEMS Cantilever for Sensing Application,"Abstract—Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) can-
tilevers are sensitive to minute changes in environmental
parameters. MEMS cantilevers possess a single readout
transduction mechanism like stress to frequency, resistive
and capacitive changes. Here, we demonstrate a novel dual
readout MEMS cantilever for sensing applications with high
optical and resistive sensitivities. The proposed work focuses
on the design, fabrication and characterizationof an L-shaped
2D photonic crystals (PhC) waveguide piezoresistive MEMS
cantilever and its use in a sensor platform. We integrated a 2D
PhC waveguide on top of the cantilever along with a piezore-
sistor element embedded within the cantilever and attained a
synergistic combination of both optical and resistive sensing.
When the cantileverdeﬂects in the ‘Z’ direction, it is perceived that it leads to stress in the cantileverand the corresponding
change in resistance and the optical property is measured. Thus, a unique L-shaped cantilever is designed for reliable
coupling of the light inside the 2D PhC waveguide using optical ﬁber. An orthogonal measurement setup is developed
to demonstrate the cantilevers dual readout feature. We achieved excellent piezoresistive and optical sensitivities
of ∼0.0072 ((ΔR/R)/µm), and ∼0.046 ((ΔP/P)/µm), respectively. The fabricated cantilever is tested with the VOC and
measurements show that it provides two distinct signatures i.e., ΔR/R and ΔP/P for the same target analyte. Therefore, the
miniaturized MEMS cantilever is unique because of its dual readout feature and it can be vital in high detection accuracy
applications."
83,Hybrid Pattern Recognition for Rapid Explosive Sensing With Comprehensive Analysis,"Abstract—This paper presents a hybrid pattern recognition
with temperature compensation (HPR-TC) used within an
E-Nose system. HPR-TC with E-nose has the novelty, amongst
MEMS sensor platforms, of having two modes of opera-
tion i.e., rapid mode of detection to be used in time-critical
conditions and comprehensive analysis mode for improved
detection accuracy. Two modes of operations in HPR-TC are
possiblebecauseof the implementationof hybrid PR featuring
a combination of two different data analysis techniques for
explosive sensing. The ﬁrst part of the hybrid PR is the binary
PR based on threshold-baseddetection and the second one is
the analog PR based on PCA and K-mean. The E-Nose system
with proposed HPR-TC is validated with two different highly
sensitive MEMS sensor types, i.e., SU8 and Si3Nx piezo-resistive cantilever. These MEMS sensors are coated with surface
receptors, 4-MBA, 6-MNA and 4-ATP, to improve the selectivity. The E-Nose system can detect explosive compounds such
as TNT, RDX, and PETN, in a controlledenvironmentat a concentrationas low as 16ppb of TNT, 56ppb of RDX and 134ppb of
PETN. Furthermore, measurements show that E-Nose with temperature compensated binary PR can detect the explosives
with a detection accuracy higher than 74% as true positives and higher than 79% as true negatives in a short time, within
initial 17 seconds of the experiment. However, the temperature compensated analog PR gives a detailed classiﬁcation
of explosives with a higher detection accuracy of 80% as true positives and 86% as true negatives after approximately
95 seconds.

This work reports a novel method of microfabrication for silicon nitride based piezoresistive microcantilever device, to
minimize the residual stress induced bending. The microcantilever of dimension L 9 W * 250 9 100 lm2 with stack
(Si3N4/Poly-Si/Si3N4/SiO2) thickness * 1 lm was realized, by using standard six masks and bulk silicon micromachining
fabrication process. In order to compensate the residual inbuilt stress, asymmetric structure layers for microcantilever was
proposed and the presence of thin oxide layer underneath the released microcantilever stack was used to control the
bending. The surface proﬁler measurement results showed the curvature bending in the range of * 4 ± 3 lm. The
microcantilever was characterized further to evaluate its physical parameters such as mechanical deﬂection sensitivity and
spring constant. The deﬂection sensitivity and spring constant values were * 0.161 ppm/nm and * 0.2 N/m, respec-
tively. Finally, the practical application of fabricated piezoresistive microcantilevers was demonstrated by using it for
explosive vapors sensing."

effective, ﬁeld-deployable portable system that constitutes
a 4-channel signal conditioning circuit and multi-coated
piezo-resistive micro-cantilever sensors for explosive sens-
ing. E-Nose also features an embedded PCA and K-means
based pattern recognition (PR) algorithm for the classiﬁcation
of explosives from non-explosives. The 4-channel conﬁgura-
tion is a stack of two 2-channel circuits that are capable of
measuring the change in the sensorresistance or capacitance
in four optional modes of ΔR-Δ R,ΔR-ΔC,Δ C-ΔR, and ΔC-ΔC
by using time multiplexing. The circuit uses a bidirectional
AC current excitation method to drive the sensor bridge for
signiﬁcant reduction of DC offset errors, 1/f noise, line noise,
and DC drifts. The proposedsignal conditioningcircuituses the phase-sensitivesynchronousrectiﬁcation(PSSR) method
for AC-to-DC conversion by using balanced demodulation. The circuit can measure a wide range of resistors that range
from 100 Ω to 4 MΩ, with a sensitivity of 0.4mV/ppm and the worst relative error of 2.6%. The capacitive measurement
range is from 100pF to 100 µF with the worst relative error of 3.3%. The entire data processing and the PR algorithms
run on Raspberry Pi (R-Pi), which is integrated into the E-Nose system. The system performance is tested with MEMS
cantilevers for the detection of explosive compounds, such as TNT and its derivatives, RDX and PETN in a controlled
environment at a concentration that was as low as 16ppb TNT, 56ppb RDX and 134ppb of PETN. Measurements show
that the E-Nose can detect explosives with 77% as true positive results without considering the environmental and mixed

cantilevers with self-assembled monolayer of Zinc porphyrin in 
vapor phase. Porphyrins have been reported to be effective for 
explosive detection, though incorporation of its thin films on 
polymer cantilevers is difficult due to harsh solvents of porphyrin 
which damage the polymer layers like SU-8. Hence a non-
damaging process which is also industry friendly and useful for 
mass production is required. The vapor phase technique 
developed here to deposit self-assembled monolayers (VPSAM) of 
Porphyrins is a MEMS/CMOS compatible process which opens 
up a whole new set of opportunities. In this paper, we discuss the 
process of VPSAM and show its application in explosive detection 
of nitro-based explosives (PETN, RDX, TNT)."

Abstract
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been extensively ex-
plored as a leading approach for modeling and represent-
ing 3D data across various domains. Their ability to cap-
ture arbitrary scale point clouds and generate novel views
makes them particularly valuable for digitizing cultural her-
itage sites. However, despite their impressive rendering ca-
pabilities, prior methods have often overlooked a significant
real-world challenge: handling open-world scenarios charac-
terized by unstructured data containing multiple classes in a
single set of unlabeled images. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel method NCD-NeRF that leverages Novel-
Class Discovery to effectively tackle the complexities inher-
ent in real-world data with unlabeled classes while excelling
in producing high-quality NeRF representation. To validate
our approach, we conducted a benchmarking analysis using a
custom-collected dataset featuring UNESCO World Heritage
sites in India. We observe that our proposed NCD-NeRF can
parallely discover novel classes and render high-quality 3D
volumes."

84,NTIRE 2024 Dense and Non-Homogeneous Dehazing Challenge Report,"Abstract
This study examines the results of the NTIRE 2024 Chal-
lenge on Dense and Non-Homogeneous Dehazing. Innova-
tive methods were introduced and tested using a new im-
age dataset named DNH-HAZE. The DNH-HAZE dataset
comprises 50 pairs of authentic outdoor images showcasing
dense and non-homogeneous haze alongside corresponding
haze-free images of identical scenes. The haze was sim-
ulated using a professional setup designed to mirror real-
world hazy conditions. The competition attracted 374 par-
ticipants, with 16 teams presenting solutions for the final
evaluation phase. The proposed solutions showed the lead-
ing edge of image dehazing technology."
84,LGAfford-Net: A Local Geometry Aware Affordance Detection Network for 3D Point Clouds,"Abstract
In this paper, we introduce LGAfford-Net, a novel archi-
tecture tailored for affordance detection in 3D point clouds.
Affordance, crucial for human-robot interaction, denotes
regions on objects where interaction is possible. Under-
standing affordance demands perceiving 3D space akin to
humans. Leveraging the ubiquity of point clouds in cap-
turing 3D environments, our method addresses challenges
posed by their sparse, unordered, and unstructured nature.
Unlike prior approaches that overlook local context and se-
mantic cues, we propose a Semantic Geometric Correla-
tor (SGC) block, integrating Local Geometric Descriptor
(LGD) for local understanding, and Edge Convolution for
semantic awareness. The integration of SGC, LGD, and
edge convolution within our network enhances its capability
to perceive and understand affordances by leveraging both
geometric and semantic information effectively. Addition-
ally, we employ Class Specific Classifiers (CSC) to accom-
modate multiple affordance types per point. CSC effectively
establish one to many relationship between point to affor-
dance labels. We demonstrate the results of proposed archi-
tecture on 3DAffordanceNet a benchmark dataset and com-
pare them with state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the features learnt by our proposed ar-
chitecture for the point cloud classification task using the
ModelNet40 dataset."
84,HNN: Hierarchical Noise-Deinterlace Net Towards Image Denoising,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework
for image denoising and term it Hierarchical Noise-
Deinterlace Net (HNN). Image denoising techniques aim to
recover clean images from noisy observations by reducing
unwanted noise and artifacts to enhance the clarity and in-
troduce spatial coherence. Images captured during chal-
lenging scenarios suffer from granular noise, inducing fine-
scale variations in the image, which occur due to the limi-
tations of imaging technology or environmental conditions.
This granular noise can significantly degrade the quality of
the image, making it less useful for applications like ob-
ject detection, image restoration/enhancement, face detec-
tion, and image super-resolution. From literature, we infer
learning global-local features significantly contribute in re-
ducing unwanted noise and artifacts within images. Typi-
cally, researchers rely on residual learning, Generative Ad-
versarial Networks (GANs), and Attention Mechanisms to
learn global-local features. However, these methods face
challenges such as vanishing gradients, limited generaliza-
tion of generators in GANs, lack of global context aware-
ness and computation complexity in attention mechanisms
leading to drop in performance. Towards this, we propose
a hierarchical framework to process both global and lo-
cal information across distinct levels of hierarchy. More
specifically, we propose a hierarchical encoder-decoder
network, with a distinct Global-Local Spatio-Contextual
(GLSC) block for learning of fine-grained features and
high-frequency details in an image. The proposed frame-
work improves image denoising, as it allows the model to
capture and utilize information from different scales, ensur-
ing a comprehensive understanding of the image content.
We demonstrate the efficacy of proposed HNN framework,
on benchmark datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods with 5% (↑in dB) increase in performance."

84,ASUR3D: Arbitrary Scale Upsampling and Refinement of 3D Point Clouds using Local Occupancy Fields,"Abstract
In this paper, we introduce ASUR3D, a novel methodol-
ogy for the arbitrary-scale upsampling of 3D point clouds
employing Local Occupancy Representation. Our proposed
implicit occupancy representation enables efﬁcient point
classiﬁcation, effectively discerning points belonging to the
surface from non-surface points. Learning an implicit rep-
resentation of open surfaces, enables one to capture the
better local neighbourhood representation, leading to ﬁner
reﬁnement and reconstruction with enhanced preservation
of intricate geometric details. Leveraging this capability,
we can accurately sample an arbitrary number of points on
the surface, facilitating precise and ﬂexible upsampling. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASUR3D on PUGAN and
PU1K benchmark datasets. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks and for all eval-
uation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy
of our methodology on self-proposed heritage data gener-
ated through photogrammetry, further conﬁrming its effec-
tiveness in diverse scenarios. The code is publicly available

Point clouds offer comprehensive and precise data re-

84,TP-NoDe: Topology-Aware Progressive Noising and Denoising of Point Clouds Towards Upsampling,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose TP-NoDe, a novel Topology-
aware Progressive Noising and Denoising technique for 3D
point cloud upsampling. TP-NoDe revisits the traditional
method of upsampling of the point cloud by introducing
a novel perspective of adding local topological noise by
incorporating a novel algorithm Density-Aware k nearest
neighbour (DA-kNN) followed by denoising to map noisy
perturbations to the topology of the point cloud. Unlike pre-
vious methods, we progressively upsample the point cloud,
starting at a 2 × upsampling ratio and advancing to a de-
sired ratio. TP-NoDe generates intermediate upsampling
resolutions for free, obviating the need to train different
models for varying upsampling ratios. TP-NoDe mitigates
the need for task-speciﬁc training of upsampling networks
for a speciﬁc upsampling ratio by reusing a point cloud
denoising framework. We demonstrate the supremacy of
our method TP-NoDe on the PU-GAN dataset and compare
it with state-of-the-art upsampling methods. The code is

84,DeFi: Detection and Filling of Holes in Point Clouds Towards Restoration of Digitized Cultural Heritage Models,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose DeFi: a novel perspective for
hole detection and ﬁlling of a given deteriorated 3D point
cloud towards digital preservation of cultural heritage sites.
Preservation of heritage demands digitization as cultural
heritage sites deteriorate due to natural calamities and hu-
man activities. Digital preservation promotes acquisition of
3D data using 3D sensor or Multi-view reconstruction. Un-
fortunately, 3D data acquisition ﬁnds challenges due to the
limitations in sensor technology and inappropriate capture
conditions, leading to formation of missing regions or holes
in the acquired point cloud. To address this, we propose a
pipeline consisting of detection of hole boundaries, and un-
derstanding the geometry of the hole boundaries to ﬁll the
region of the point cloud. Recent research on hole detection
and ﬁlling fails to generalize on complex structures such
as heritage sites, as they ﬁnd challenges in differentiating
between the hole boundary and non-hole boundary points.
To address this, we propose to detect boundary points of
point cloud and learn to classify them into “hole bound-
ary” and “non-hole boundary” points. We generate a syn-
thetic dataset based on ModelNet40 to learn the detection
of hole boundaries. We demonstrate the results of the pro-
posed pipeline on (i) ModelNet40 dataset, (ii) Heritage 3D
models generated via photogrammetry, and compare the re-
sults with state-of-the-art methods."
84,LightNet: Generative Model for Enhancement of Low-Light Images,"Abstract
In this work, we propose a generative model for enhance-
ment of images captured in low-light conditions. Sensor
constraints and inappropriate lighting conditions are ac-
countable for degradations introduced in the image. The
degradations limit the visibility of the scene and impedes
vision in applications like detection, tracking and surveil-
lance.
Recently, deep learning algorithms have taken a
leap for enhancement of images captured in low-light con-
ditions. However, these algorithms fail to capture informa-
tion on ﬁne grained local structures and limit the perfor-
mance. Towards this, we propose a generative model for en-
hancement of low-lit images to exploit both local and global
information, and term it as LightNet. In proposed architec-
ture LightNet, we include a hierarchical generator encom-
passing encoder-decoder module to capture global infor-
mation and a patch discriminator to capture ﬁne grained
local information. Typically, the encoder-decoder module
downsamples the low-lit image into distinct scales. Learn-
ing at distinct scales helps to capture both local and global
features thereby suppressing the unwanted features (noise,
blur). With this motivation, we downsample the captured
low-lit image into 3 distinct scales. The decoder upsam-
ples the encoded features at respective scales to generate
an enhanced image. We demonstrate the results of proposed
methodology on custom and benchmark datasets in com-
parison with SOTA methods using appropriate quantitative
metrics."
84,IPD-Net: SO(3) Invariant Primitive Decompositional Network for 3D Point Clouds,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose IPD-Net: Invariant Primi-
tive Decompositional Network, a SO(3) invariant frame-
work for decomposition of a point cloud. The human cog-
nitive system is able to identify and interpret familiar ob-
jects regardless of their orientation and abstraction. Re-
cent research aims to bring this capability to machines for
understanding the 3D world. In this work, we present a
framework inspired by human cognition to decompose point
clouds into four primitive 3D shapes (plane, cylinder, cone,
and sphere) and enable machines to understand the objects
irrespective of its orientations. We employ Implicit Invari-
ant Features (IIF) to learn local geometric relations by im-
plicitly representing the point cloud with enhanced geomet-
ric information invariant towards SO(3) rotations. We also
use Spatial Rectification Unit (SRU) to extract invariant
global signatures. We demonstrate the results of our pro-
posed methodology for SO(3) invariant decomposition on
TraceParts Dataset, and show the generalizability of pro-
posed IPD-Net as plugin for downstream task on classifica-
tion of point clouds. We compare the results of classification
with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark dataset (Mod-
elNet40)."
84,MIPI 2023 Challenge on Nighttime Flare Removal: Methods and Results,"Abstract
Developing and integrating advanced image sensors
with novel algorithms in camera systems are prevalent with
the increasing demand for computational photography and
imaging on mobile platforms. However, the lack of high-
quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-
depth exchange of views from industry and academia con-
strain the development of mobile intelligent photography
and imaging (MIPI). With the success of the 1st MIPI Work-
shop@ECCV 2022, we introduce the second MIPI chal-
lenge including four tracks focusing on novel image sensors
and imaging algorithms. In this paper, we summarize and
review the Nighttime Flare Removal track on MIPI 2023.

84,DepthCue: Restoration of Underwater Images Using Monocular Depth as a Clue,"Abstract
In this paper, we perform restoration of underwater
images by considering principles of the image formation
model in deep neural networks. Typically, underwater im-
ages suffer from blur, color loss and other degradations
due to the scattering and absorption of light in water as a
medium. Quality of restoration is sensitive to depth as scat-
tering and absorption of light increases with depth and in-
troduces a considerable amount of degradation. However,
from literature we infer, recent restoration frameworks do
not consider the influence of depth on restoration of under-
water images. Towards this, we propose to consider depth
as a clue for restoration considering relative distance of ob-
jects in the scene. We introduce depth with different scales
as a clue for learning restoration and term the proposed ar-
chitecture as DepthCue. We foresee to facilitate the restora-
tion by eliminating the effect of degradations like lost color,
blur and noise. We demonstrate our results on benchmark
datasets and compare with the state-of-the-art restoration
techniques using various quality metrics."

84,Metric-KNN is All You Need,"ABSTRACT
In this work, we propose a novel Metric-K Nearest Neighbor (M-
KNN) to facilitate topology aware learning in point clouds. Topol-
ogy aware learning is achieved by accumulation of local features
in deep-learning model. Recent work rely on Ball queries or K-
Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) for local feature extraction of point clouds
and finds challenges in retaining topological information. M-KNN
employes a generalised Minkowski distance in the KNN search
algorithm for topological representation of point clouds. M-KNN
enables state-of-the-art point cloud methods to perform topology
aware downstream tasks. We demonstrate the performance of M-
KNN as plugin towards point cloud classification, part-segmentation,
and denoising using benchmark dataset."
84,VG-VAE: A Venatus Geometry Point-Cloud Variational Auto-Encoder,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose VG-VAE: Venatus Geometric
Variational Auto-Encoder for capturing unsupervised hi-
erarchical local and global geometric signatures in point-
cloud. Recent research emphasises the significance of the
underlying intrinsic geometry for pointcloud processing.
Our contribution is to extract and analyse the morphology
of the pointcloud using the proposed Geometric Proximity
Correlator (GPC) and variational sampling of the latent.
The extraction of local geometric signatures is facilitated
by the GPC, whereas the extraction of global geometry is
facilitated by variational sampling. Furthermore, we apply
a naive mix of vector algebra and 3D geometry to extract
the basic per-point geometric signature, which assists the
unsupervised hypothesis. We provide statistical analyses of
local and global geometric signatures. The impacts of our
geometric features are demonstrated on pointcloud classifi-
cation as downstream task using the classic pointcloud fea-
ture extractor PointNet. We demonstrate our analysis on
ModelNet40 a benchmark dataset, and compare with state-
of-the-art techniques."
84,AquaGAN: Restoration of Underwater Images,"Abstract
In this paper, we propose a generative model to restore
degraded underwater images considering attenuation coef-
ficients as clue and name it as AquaGAN. Computing the
attenuation coefficients as given in revised image forma-
tion model demands in-situ measurements. However, in-
situ measurements in underwater scenario is infeasible. To-
wards this, we propose to estimate the attenuation coeffi-
cients using learning based methods and use these parame-
ters as clue for restoration of degraded underwater images.
Restoration of true colors in underwater scenario is chal-
lenging as intensity of light changes with distance. Preserv-
ing true colors during restoration by minimizing single ob-
jective function may affect the quality of restored image. To-
wards this, we propose to combine different objective func-
tions for restoration of true colors. We demonstrate the re-
sults of restoration on benchmark dataset and compare the
results of proposed methodology with state-of-the-art meth-
ods both qualitatively and quantitatively."

84,RUIG: Realistic Underwater Image Generation Towards Restoration,"Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel method for generat-
ing synthetic underwater images considering revised im-
age formation model.
We propose to use the generated
synthetic underwater images to train a conditional gener-
ative adversarial network (CGAN) towards restoration of
degraded underwater images. Restoration of degraded un-
derwater images using traditional dehazing models is chal-
lenging as they are insensitive to wavelength, depth, water
type and treat backscattering and direct signal attenuation
coefﬁcients to be equal. However, learning based models
for restoration perform well but sensitive to availability of
ground truth information. Generating ground truth labels
in underwater scenario demands in-situ measurements us-
ing expensive equipments and is infeasible due to varying
underwater currents. Towards this, we propose to generate
synthetic underwater images using revised image formation
model. Revised image formation model is sensitive to dif-
ferent attenuation coefﬁcients: 1) back scattering, 2) direct
scattering and 3) veiling light. We propose to estimate these
attenuation coefﬁcients considering proven facts from the
literature. We demonstrate restoration of real underwater
images through restoration framework trained using ren-
dered synthetic underwater images, and compare results of
restoration with state-of-the-art techniques."

This paper presents a solution to the broadband monostatic and bistatic Radar Cross Sec-
tion (RCS) reduction of a micrometer wave antenna operating at 3.8 THz without much 
deterioration in its radiation characteristics. A Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) is pro-
posed which behaves as a linear polarization converter (PC), thus converting linearly polar-
ized electromagnetic waves to cross-polarized waves over two frequency bands. The PC 
is constituted of a finite geometrical pattern made of copper etched on the top of a dielec-
tric substrate made of polyimide and copper layer at the bottom. Broadband polarization 
conversion efficiency reaches over 90% for the range of 3.72–4 THz and 5.52–6.28 THz 
with resonances occurring at 3.84 THz and 5.92 THz at which 99.5% and 99.8% polari-
zation conversion efficiency are acquired, respectively. A meticulous arrangement of PC

polarized waves from 1 to 10 THz."

The simultaneous achievement of multiband absorption, polarisation-insensitive, and angularly stable absorber is 
a difficult job. Therefore, in this article, an efficient single-layered absorber is designed, critically analysed, fabricated, 
and experimentally validated. The proposed model incorporates eight sectors loaded a circle inside the square. The 
four discrete absorption peaks are observed at 4.4 GHz, 6.0 GHz, 14.1 GHz, and 16.0 GHz manifesting absorption 
intensities of 94%, 84%, 82%, and 92%, respectively. Parametric studies have been also exercised to investigate the 
influence of discrete geometrical design variables on the proposed absorber. The proposed structure is symmetrical 
in geometry, consequence in polarisation-independent behaviour. The absorption mechanism is also explained by 
analysing the surface current, electric field, and magnetic field distributions. Besides, the complex electromagnetic 
parameters are extracted to realise the absorption phenomenon. Additionally, to validate the simulated results, an 
optimal sample is fabricated and the measured response is well-matched with simulated ones."

85,Cascaded Graphene Frequency Selective Surface Integrated Tunable Broadband Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber,"Abstract: The quest of novel materials and structures to design an efficient absorber for realizing wave trapping and absorption at 
terahertz (THz) frequencies is an open topic. But the design of a thin, wideband and tunable THz absorber is still an arduous job. 
Hence, in this work, a hybrid THz metamaterial absorber (THz-MMA) integrated with a cascaded graphene frequency selective surface 
(FSS), with ultra-high absorbance over a wide frequency range is designed using an analytical equivalent circuit model (ECM). Such an 
approach provides a feasible way to optimize the device by interrelating the effective electromagnetic (EM) and circuit parameters with 
the unit cell dimensions of FSS. A systematic study and critical analysis over a wide range of device parameters including graphene 
chemical potential and FSS design variables is demonstrated. A peak dip in reflection coefficient (RC) of -30.27 dB is observed at 2.94 
THz for an optimal device with a chemical potential (µc) of 0.38 eV (µc1), and 0.25 eV (µc2) in the range of 0.1-4.0 THz. The cascaded 
FSS configuration results in the unique anti-reflection based absorption phenomena, which is responsible for the achievement of -10 
dB absorption bandwidth of 2.34 THz (0.85-3.19 THz). In addition, the frequency dependent effective permittivity, permeability and 
impedance is extracted using reflection data, in order to understand the device physics. Such ultra-thin and broadband absorbing 
device architecture may confer potential application perspectives in THz sensing, imaging and detection."

86,#NAME?,"ABSTRACT 
Combining different resolution of remote sensing satellites becomes a unique 
approach for vegetation and wildlife habitat assessment study. Remote sensing 
technology can reach land and water on the Earth's surface, and it can inter-
pret signals from spectral responses. When these techniques are combined 
with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), land can be monitored in a va-
riety of ways. Meanwhile, changes in land use led to changes in vegetation on 
the ground, with natural vegetation being removed from natural forests, leav-
ing a degraded forest. This issue was not investigated for assessing habitat 
suitability for important plantations such as Eucalyptus plantation. Therefore, 
the study employed remote sensing and Geographical Information System 
(GIS) to model suitability of habitat to live and to survive in the Eucalyptus 
plantation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized 
Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from a mathematical equation can 
demonstrate intensity of greenness of green vegetation in particular area and 
time, and availability of soil moisture, respectively, is very suitable to model 
the greenness of the area. WorldView-2 satellite image was pre-proceed, pro-
ceed, and classified to produce land use indicator in Sabah Softwoods Berhad 
plantation majoring Eucalyptus spp. tree planted in Tawau, Sabah. Sentinel 
and Landsat 8 image were used for vegetation and water stress indicator were 
downloaded from Land Viewer application. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) 
at monthly scale was also calculated and ranked the productivity for the suita-
bility mapping. Climatic condition based on monthly precipitation and season-
ality derived from ASEAN Specialized Meteorological Centre (ASMC) was 
employed for ranking its suitability value. In this study, natural forest and oil 
palm plantation is tested to developed suitability map for vegetation and wild-
life habitat to live with. All indicators were ranked 10 to 40 presenting benefit 
and usefulness of the indicator to vegetation and wildlife in the study area. 
Then, final classification was made from accumulation of those indicators into 
0 to 200 (Not suitable to Highly suitable). The results showed 59.9% of the 
area classified as moderately suitable, 36.9% highly suitable, 3.2% least suitable 
and no area was classified as not suitable. This type of study assisted forest 
managers and policymakers for better managing of their forests for better life 
of trees and wildlife under their management. The methodology adapted in the 
study is ecologically sounded and economically viable to be modified and com-
plied in Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in Malaysia and other tropical 
forest regions.

86,Modeling of Evaporation Rate for Peatland Fire Prevention Using Internet of Things (IoT) System,"Abstract: Peatland refers to the peat soil and wetland biological environment growing on the surface.
However, unexpected ﬁres in peatlands frequently have brought severe greenhouse gas emissions
and transboundary haze to Southeast Asia. To alleviate this issue, this paper ﬁrst establishes an
Internet of Things (IoT) system for peatland monitoring and management in the Raja Musa Forest
Reserve (RMFR) in Selangor, Malaysia, and proposes a more efﬁcient and low-complexity model
for calculating the Duff Moisture Code (DMC) in peatland forests using groundwater level (GWL)
and relative humidity. The feasibility of the IoT system is veriﬁed by comparing its data with those
published by Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia). The proposed Linear_DMC
Model and Linear_Mixed_DMC Model are compared with the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI)
model, and their performance is evaluated using IoT measurement data and actual values published
by METMalaysia. The results show that the correlation between the measured data of the IoT system
and the data from METMalaysia within the same duration is larger than 0.84, with a mean square
error (MSE) of 2.56, and a correlation of 0.91 can be achieved between calculated DMC using the
proposed model and actual values. This ﬁnding is of great signiﬁcance for predicting peatland forest
ﬁres in the ﬁeld and providing the basis for ﬁre prevention and decision making to improve disaster
prevention and reduction."
86,Assessment of the Effects of Artificial Fungi Inoculations on Agarwood Formation and Sap Flow Rate of Aquilaria malaccensis Lam. Using Sonic Tomography (SoT) and Sap Flow Meter (SFM),"Abstract: Agarwood is a valuable aromatic resinous wood that is biosynthesised when a fungal attack
injures the healthy wood tissue of the Aquilaria tree. The magnitude of infection related to sap ﬂow
(SF) is one of the most critical functional traits to evaluate the tree’s response to various adverse
conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the reliability of sonic tomography
(SoT) and sap ﬂow meter (SFM) in studying the inﬂuence of inoculation fungi Pichia kudriavzevii
Boidin, Pignal and Besson, and Paecilomyces niveus Stolk and Samson, on deteriorated wood (Dt) and
SF rate in Aquilaria malaccensis Lam. A. malaccensis trees with small, medium, and large diameters
were inoculated with each fungus separately at the bottom, middle, and top positions of the tree and
the area of sapwood was measured after 6, 12, and 24 months to stimulate the agarwood formation.
Furthermore, the SF rate was assessed using SFM in the position of the selected trees. There was a
signiﬁcant difference (p ≤0.05) in Dt% and SF rate between inoculated and uninoculated trees. The
Dt percentage in trees inoculated with P. kudriavzevii, P. niveus, and control trees was 25.6%, 25.7%,
and 15.0%, respectively. The SF rate was lower in P. kudriavzevii, with 207.7 cm3/h, than in the control
trees, with 312.9 cm3/h in the small-diameter class. In summary, the results of this study emphasise
the importance of inoculation duration (24 months) and the effects of water conductivity, especially
tree diameter class (small), on the biosynthetic response of resinous substance."
86,IOP Conference Series: Earth and,"Abstract.  Forests and agricultural plantations are vegetated areas that play an important 
role in catering to human needs. The characteristics of the two lands can be recognized 
by utilizing remote sensing techniques of WorldView-2 satellite images as green 
biomass monitoring tools. The research was undertaken in Sabah Softwoods Berhad 
(SSB) forest plantation, East Malaysia, to analyze land use in the high functionality 
areas. Aside from the social benefits, there has been a lack of research conducted to 
estimate the areas' Net Primary Productivity (NPP) using remote sensing of biophysical 
characteristics. The NPP quantifies the biomass generated by the green plants, which 
provides the chemical energy that drives most of the biotic processes on the Earth. The 
NPP calculated from the study for all land features in the study areas ranged from 39.33

86,IOP Conference Series: Earth and,"Abstract. Early examination of the water condition of the plants utilizing remote sensing 
technology can be used to assess the health of the vegetation in the Eucalyptus forest plantation. 
To preserve a sustainable wood supply and wooded region that is necessary to human life and 
vital wood supplies, the forested region should be protected from disease and environmental 
damage. Disease and environmental impacts are two of the most critical challenges in Eucalyptus 
forest management. To calculate the vegetation index and identify land cover in the research 
region, remote sensing with Catalyst Professional software based on Object Analyst (OBIA) 
tools was utilized. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a valuable index for 
assessing early vegetation health. For atmospheric correction and haze removal, the image was 
first pre-processed with ATCOR tools. Second, the image was converted to NDVI using 
algorithm library tools. In addition, for land cover classification in the area, an OBIA based on 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized, followed by an accuracy assessment. Using 
ArcGIS software, zonal statistics were used to calculate the NDVI value for each land cover 
category. According to the method, the map produced roads, plantations, buildings, low-density 
vegetation, oil palm, and open area classifications. Based on accuracy assessment in OBIA, 
plantation, oil palm, and open area were all 100% accurate, whereas low-density vegetation and 
oil palm were 100% accurate according to the user. Producer accuracy was lowest on roads, 
whereas user accuracy was lowest in open areas. Non-vegetated land is difficult to classify at 
this site, according to the accuracy assessment results.  The map improved accuracy since the 
study used a lower segmentation scale factor of 50, which produced fine vectors ascribed for 
classification.  The average NDVI for oil palm area was 0.71, and 0.69 for plantation. Because 
it was difficult to classify open areas and roads, the NDVI for the class was low, at 0.37 and 
0.22, respectively. From land use classification, the plantation was classified (37%), low-density 
vegetation area (28%), and oil palm (21%). Others make up only 2 to 7% of the site's overall 
area. According to the study, NDVI is a useful indicator for assessing the health of vegetation in 
areas where NDVI values are larger than 0.70 and presents pf mixed landscape and non-
vegetated features. A higher NDVI value implies that the plant is in good enough shape to 
conduct photosynthetic activities thus producing biomass for sustaining vegetation health. This 
type of inquiry can forecast more indices to produce higher accuracy of land use maps for the 
Eucalyptus plantation.  At the same time, this type of research can assist forest managers in 
detecting large areas in their plantation for vegetation health assessment such as for early disease 
detection.

86,"Near infrared spectroscopy of plantation forest soil nutrients in Sabah, Malaysia, and the potential for microsite assessment","Abstract
Knowledge of soil physical and chemical properties is vital to the optimal growing performance of agricultural crops,
including plantation forest trees. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been shown to be a tool that enables rapid and low-
cost assessment of soils, however its use in forest plantations has been slow to develop. This study shows the development
of calibrations for total organic carbon, total nitrogen and soil pH using a handheld NIR spectrometer for soils at three sites
in Sabah, Malaysia. Soil samples were collected, dried, milled and scanned after which they were analysed using standard
chemical methods to obtain total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN). Partial least squares regression was used to
develop calibrations between reference data and NIR spectra and validated using an independent sample set. The cali-
bration of soil pH is made using a subset of samples across A- and B-horizons for samples from two of the three sites. The
most effective spectral pre-treatment was the standard normal variate for TOC and TN while the Savitzky-Golay first
derivative was the best pre-treatment for predicting soil pH. Principal component analysis was performed on the raw
NIR spectra of all samples to confirm that the samples from different sites were able to be used in a single regression
analysis. Kennard-Stone selection was used to create calibration sets and validation sets from the combined spectra from all
sites and both soil horizons. Calibrations were also developed independently on the A- and B-horizon samples, but there
were insufficient sample numbers to utilize an independent validation set. The coefficients of determination for the
validation set (r2
p) were 0.77 and 53 for TOC and TN respectively while the root mean square error of prediction
(RMSEP) was 0.44 g 100 g1 for TOC and 0.051 g 100 g1 for TN. In addition, it showcases the application of these
calibrations to provide spatial assessment of two differing micro-sites within a single Eucalyptus pellita progeny breeding
trial. Combined with the potential to monitor foliar nutrients, the ability to obtain high spatial details of soil composition
will assist tree plantation growers and also other agricultural producers, such as oil palm plantation managers, to better
manage their soil and fertiliser regimes."
86,A bibliometric analysis of tropical mangrove forest land use change from 2010 to 2020,"Abstract
Mangrove land use changes of varied intensities have long been a problem in tropical man-
grove forests. This has resulted in various degrees of mangrove land use modification, 
which catch many interests in the region for research. The research provided here is a bib-
liometric analysis of scholarly articles published around the world in various publication 
document types on changes in land use of tropical mangrove forests based on remote sens-
ing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Scientific data analysis was undertaken 
by using bibliometric approaches on 6,574 papers extracted from the Scopus databases 
between 2010 and 2020. The findings revealed that the number of publications continu-
ously climbed from under 400 to an average of 50–60 per year till 2019. The data showed 
that the mangrove forest modifications study gained traction when the highest number of 
citations, 9,236 in 2015, were observed. We can also notice that the overall number of 
citations fluctuated a lot during the first five years (2010–2015) but increased from 2013 
to 2015. The findings demonstrate how remote sensing satellites have aided vegetation 
and land study in recent years. The findings also revealed that the analysis tools of Land 
Use Change, Vegetation Index, Mangrove, Tropical Country, Remote Sensing, and Tropi-
cal contributed to scientific knowledge of current issues of mangrove land use change in

86,Peatlands Monitoring in Malaysia with IoT,"Abstract. Peatland forest ﬁres are a serious threat to the biodiversity-
ecosystem and to human health in South East Asia, especially in the
dry season. Here, approximately 2.13 million hectares of peat swamp
forests are found and made up of 6.5% of the total land area. However,
monitoring and management of sustainable peat swamp forests can be
improved, as degradation of the forest may happen. One of the main
challenges in the forest management process is the lack of manpower to
obtain in-situ samples for analysis and monitoring purposes. This paper
proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-based peatland forest management
and monitoring system in Raja Musa Forest Reserve (RMFR), Selangor,
Malaysia. Real-time peatland data such as Ground Water Level (GWL),
soil temperature, and soil humidity as well as local meteorological data
such as rain precipitation, wind speed, ambient temperature, and am-
bient humidity are obtained from deployed IoT system on sites. The
peatland data from January to March 2020 are recorded and analyzed."

As years pass by, rice production has not been inclined to align with some populations in 
Malaysia that keep growing. Thus, the self-sufficiency level (SSL) of 100% is not achieved 
until today. The government intends to expand the granary areas for rice farming by 
concerning the SSL target to be completed. Despite that, crop management, specifically 
paddy farming, is tedious and requires a lot of workforces. However, as technology develops 
and gets more sophisticated these days, a discipline that helps in crop management has been 
introduced over the years called remote sensing. Remote sensing undoubtedly showed 
significant application in crop management. The Vegetation Indices (VIs) algorithm is a 
branch in remote sensing that enables researchers to evaluate vegetative covers on the ground 
from aerial view by using spectral measurements either qualitatively or quantitatively. The 
VIs are obtained from the spectral response of the ground areas from the aerial view 
commonly composed of vegetation areas, soil brightness, various vegetation on the ground, 
canopy, environmental effects, shadow, and moisture level of soil and plants. Nonetheless, 
the favourable of remote sensing is the spatial-temporal, which helps determine vegetation 
changes over a certain period. This also includes rice farming. Thus, this paper discusses and 
summarizes the VIs algorithm that was relevant in the application of rice planting. It proposes 
the popularity and relevance of the VIs algorithm in rice crop management in Malaysia."
86,Development of Rice Growth Map Using the Advanced Remote Sensing Techniques,"Abstract—Rice monitoring is one of the main issues in rice 
productivity. Farmers face difficulties in monitoring their rice 
fields due to climate change, soil conditions, age of the farmers and 
time consumed to monitor the whole area. Remote sensing 
technology is one of the alternatives to monitor rice field. The 
advancement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has 
been rapidly growing and frequently used in the agriculture 
industries to monitor crop condition. The objectives of this 
research are creating crop growth map using aerial imagery and 
object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique, and validating the 
normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) value in rice field 
map using soil plant analysis development (SPAD) and 
GreenSeeker data. The multispectral image is processed using 
OBIA to produce crop growth map. The crop growth map produced 
is embedded with information that is able to indicate the health 
status of the rice crop using NDVI. This research was carried out 
at a paddy field planted using PadiU Putra variety in Ladang 
Merdeka, Ketereh, Kelantan (0.79 ha). The results from this 
research show that OBIA method can classify vegetation and non-
vegetation to produce crop growth map. NDVI map has a strong 
correlation with Greenseeker data at 0.893 with positive 
correlation at 0.05 compared to SPAD meter. The crop growth map 
allows farmers to improve their rice farm monitoring more 
effectively using remote sensing technique."

87,Microsoft Word - final_revised_chapter,"Abstract. In the 21st century, biosensors have gathered much wider attention than 
ever before, irrespective of the technology that promises to bring them forward. 
With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the concern and efforts to restore global 
health and well-being are rising at an unprecedented rate. A requirement to 
develop precise, fast, point-of-care, reliable, easily disposable/reproducible and 
low-cost diagnostic tools have ascended. Biosensors form a primary element of 
hand-held medical kits, tools, products, and/or instruments. They have a very 
wide range of applications such as nearby environmental checks, detecting the 
onset of a disease, food quality, drug discovery, medicine dose control, and many 
more. This chapter explains how Nano/Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems 
(N/MEMS) can be enabling technology towards a sustainable, scalable, ultra-
miniaturized, easy-to-use, energy efficient, and integrated bio/chemical sensing 
system. This study provides a deeper insight into the fundamentals, recent 
advances, and potential end applications of N/MEMS sensors and integrated 
systems to detect and measure the concentration of biological and/or chemical 
analytes. Transduction principle/s, materials, efficient designs including readout 
technique, and sensor performance are explained. This is followed by a 
discussion on how N/MEMS biosensors continue to evolve. The challenges and 
possible opportunities are also discussed."
87,MEMS sensor for detection and measurement of ultra-fine particles,"Abstract
This paper investigates the performance of the micro-electro-mechanical systems resonant sensor
used for particle detection and concentration measurement. The ﬁne and ultra-ﬁne particles such as
particulate matter (PM), ferrous particles, and nanoparticles are known to contaminate the
atmosphere, ﬂuids used in industrial machines, and food, respectively. The physical principles
involved in the target particles accumulating on the sensor are presented. Micro-gravimetric
resonators that use primarily piezoelectric and thermally actuated transducers for particle detection

such as maximum possible parametric sensitivity, the detection limit of particle size and mass
concentration, linear dynamic range, and output stability, are thoroughly evaluated."
87,State-of-the-Art in Mode-Localized MEMS Coupled Resonant Sensors: A Comprehensive Review,"Abstract—This article reviews the investigation of the
mode-localized microelectromechanical system (MEMS) cou-
pled resonant sensors. This class of a sensor features a
new approach in the sensing method (i.e. sensing shifts in
the eigenstates/amplitude ratio (AR) instead of a frequency
shift) in resonant devices. The key performance metrics and
progress in terms of sensitivity, noise optimization, resolu-
tion, output stability, and bandwidth are closely observed for
the resonant devices that use multi-degree of freedom (m-
DoF) resonators for transduction and subsequent sensing.
A critical analysis, insight, and wide-ranging applications
are studied for the mode-localized sensors that operate in a
vacuum (with a higher quality factor, Q) or in an atmospheric
pressure environment. Parameters such as the role of the operating/bias point, modal overlap, different forms of the
output, and nonlinearity in the output are analyzed. The impact of structural asymmetry and how it can contribute
to the performance enhancement of the sensor design is reported. An operation of the mode-localized sensors in
the open/closed-loop conﬁguration, in linear and nonlinear regions, is presented to understand the attempts made to
enhance/optimize the sensor performance. Several potential applications developed particularly in the past ﬁve-year time

This thesis documents a first time demonstration of electromechanical transducer and/or sensor

measurement of an average kerf-width of about 60 micrometres is reported, which is 
advantageous to develop our application. A detailed study of width variation using laser cut is 
also given. Based on the in-depth literature survey, it is postulated that achieving

unprecedented (either in the industry or in academia). This important aspect is one of the 
highlights of this research. Results comprising analytical modeling, fabrication, and electrical

and finite-element analysis. The first device is mechanically coupled ring-resonator band-pass filter with centre frequency
of 4.4 MHz and a small bandwidth of only 36 kHz. Flexural-mode ring resonators have been mechanically coupled using
soft mechanical spring for realising the filtering action. Owing to inherent symmetry in the ring structure, simple approach
is used to access a low-velocity coupling locations to set a smallest possible bandwidth. The authors also show a reduction
in the amplitude of spurious mode by accentuating the filter structure in its fully differential mode inherently present in the
structure. Moreover, the effect of the number of the support beams and structural damping on the frequency response of a
filter has been analysed. A second device is mechanically coupled ring-resonator arrays with varying number of rings
coupled. The mechanical links using short stubs connect each constituent resonator of an array to its adjacent ones at
the high-velocity vibrating locations to accentuate the desired mode and reject all other spurious modes. Both
analytical and finite-element based simulation results for parameters of the designed structure are found in good
agreement.

relatively simple approach is used to access a low-velocity 
coupling locations as opposed to its clamped-clamped beam filter 
counterpart, where, a little mismatch in the position of coupling 
location near the anchors of clamped-clamped beam may result 
in a bandwidth change thereby affecting its performance.  The

88,A Robust and Privacy-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring,"Abstract—With the rollout of smart meters, a vast amount
of energy time-series became available from homes, enabling
applications such as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The
inconspicuous collection of this data, however, poses a risk to the
privacy of customers. Federated Learning (FL) eliminates the
problem of sharing raw data with a cloud service provider by
allowing machine learning models to be trained in a collaborative
fashion on decentralized data. Although several NILM techniques
that rely on FL to train a deep neural network for identifying the
energy consumption of individual appliances have been proposed
in recent years, the robustness of these techniques to malicious
users and their ability to fully protect the user privacy remain
unexplored. In this paper, we present a robust and privacy-
preserving FL-based framework to train a bidirectional trans-
former architecture for NILM. This framework takes advantage
of a meta-learning algorithm to handle the data heterogeneity
prevalent in real-world settings. The efficacy of the proposed
framework is corroborated through comparative experiments
using two real-world NILM datasets. The results show that
this framework can attain an accuracy that is on par with a
centrally-trained energy disaggregation model, while preserving
user privacy."

produces a substantial amount of medical data every year. A
major difﬁculty faced by e-Health systems is the secure stor-
age and sharing of this data without compromising its integrity
and privacy. Being a trustless, traceable, and immutable technol-

article, we propose HierChain, a hierarchical blockchain-based
data storage and sharing system for healthcare. This frame-
work provides a trustless environment that is decentralized and
tamper-resistant for efﬁcient management of data. We ﬁrst intro-
duce an optimization problem aimed at identifying the optimal
data storage solution for maximum efﬁciency. Next, we clas-
sify the health data based on its speciﬁc features, sensitivity,
and storage requirements. This classiﬁed data is then stored on
three different blockchains (Ethereum, Hyperledger Sawtooth,

fog nodes for providing computational services to the resource-
constrained Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling us to
perform data preprocessing and eliminate redundant information

88,Power Saving Approach of a Smart Watch for Monitoring the Heart Rate of a Runner,"Abstract—Heart Rate (HR) monitoring in a smart watch is
a battery consuming process. Therefore, some smart watches
prevent continuous HR sampling during low-level physical activ-
ities for improving the power usage of batteries. However, high
acceleration events like running require continuous HR sam-
pling for recording the varying HR readings, which consumes a
lot of battery power. Therefore, the challenge is to reduce the
sampling during running while recording an individual’s HR
variation (HRV). Our approach prevents continuous HR sam-
pling for long-running events without missing important HR
information. In this context, we analyze the existing real-life HRs
and acceleration datasets recorded on humans during long runs.
We design an adaptive HR sampling algorithm, A-HeaRing, from
the extracted HR variation details. A-HeaRing reduces the bat-
tery power consumption of a smart watch by more than 50%
while recording a running event. Additionally, we design a data
regeneration system for missing HR readings. The regeneration
system provides a minimum of 90% accuracy in the HR zone
estimation."

learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from user data.
However, this can give rise to critical issues surrounding data
leakage and privacy. To tackle these issues, utilizing blockchain
as a decentralized database to securely store data and employing
federated learning to extract useful insights from user data
can provide a viable solution. In this paper, we propose a
three-layered, decentralized architecture that uses a traditional
federated learning mechanism in conjunction with the Ethereum
blockchain. Moreover, for data management, we use Inter-
Planetary File System (IPFS) which is a peer-to-peer network
used to store data in a decentralized manner. We tested our
model’s feasibility by using CIFAR-10 dataset and Python as the

88,FLEC: Federated Learning for Cloud/Edge-Based Smart Industry via Batch Normalization,"Abstract—The rapid growth in the amount of data generated
from connected devices in smart industry, opens up new op-
portunities for improving the quality of service through data
sharing. However, the key barriers for data sharing by the
users of smart industries are security and privacy concerns. In
addition to financial losses, the disclosure of sensitive information
might cause major problems such as reputation damage, loss of
competitive advantage, legal and regulatory violations, and even
harm to individuals or society as a whole. In this paper, we
propose FLEC, a federated learning framework for Cloud based
smart industries. We use blockchain technology as an underlying
architecture for data management and sharing between edge and
cloud devices. Federated learning solves the problem of privacy
leakage by sharing the model updates instead of raw data while
blockchain provides a secure decentralized platform, robustness
against poisoning attacks, and incentives to the participants.
Finally, to make our approach well-suited for real-world non-
iid data scenarios, we use batch normalization to alleviate the
data heterogeneity problem. Extensive evaluation and assessment
results demonstrate the superior performance of FLEC in aspects
of accuracy, efficiency, and privacy protection."
88,Controlling Air Pollution in Data Centers using Green Data Centers,"Abstract—Growing air pollution has become a global threat to
the environment. Controlling this global threat is very challenging
and costly. Therefore, this paper proposes an air pollution control
measure using green metrics (GMs). For doing this, we minimize
the carbon emission from traditional data centers (DCs) by de-
signing the ‘Green Data Centers’ (GDCs). GDCs are the control
mechanism, which includes a set of different green protocols.
GDCs are designed in such a way that they can minimize the
carbon emission (i.e., CO
CO
CO, and CO2
CO2
CO2) from the traditional DCs.
The design of GDCs is also responsible for optimizing energy
consumption, cost-effectiveness, efﬁcient network infrastructures,
load scheduling algorithms, and the number of used devices like
switches, ports, and linecards. GDCs are constructed by taking
care of the idle server because it consumes massive energy than
the computing server. This paper also presents a taxonomy of
the existing research work, which contains the research of GDCs
related to DCs, like cloud computing and cooling techniques.
Apart from this, we discuss various green metrics (GMs), green
computing, and networking proposals of GDCs."
88,Energy-Aware Routing in SDN Enabled Data Center Network,"Abstract—Energy efficiency is considered a significant concern
in the deployment and operation of data networks. The network
devices need an enormous amount of energy to function, which
leads to an increase in energy consumption in the data center
networks (DCNs). Software-defined networking (SDN) solves the
problem by adjusting the energy consumption proportionate to
the amount of traffic. The network devices with low load can
be turned into switch-OFF mode after transferring the traffic
to another device. This energy-saving approach by analyzing the
user’s traffic demand increases the overall network utilization.
In this work, we study the energy optimization problem using
multipath routing in SDN-enabled data center networks (SD-
DCN). We formulate the energy optimization as an integer
linear program (ILP) problem to minimize the active Open
vSwitch (OVS) switches in the network. To solve the problem
in polynomial time, we propose a heuristic approach to route
the traffic flows in the SD-DCN. The proposed approach is
tested over data center network topologies – Fat-Tree and
BCube. The simulation results show that our proposed approach
presents an enhancement of 24%, 16%, and 15% in average
delay, throughput, and energy savings in the Fat-Tree topology
compared to the benchmark schemes. Further, our proposed
approach achieves 17%, 19%, and 17% enhancement in average
delay, throughput, and energy savings in the BCube topology
compared to the benchmark schemes."
88,QoS-Aware Multipath Routing in Software-Defined Networks,"Abstract—The emergence of new applications, such as online
gaming and virtual reality, necessitates the underlying network
capable of fulﬁlling high bandwidth and low latency requirements.
The software-deﬁned multipath routing is a viable approach to
fulﬁll such quality-of-service (QoS) requirements by improving
the data delivery performance through multipath. In this paper,
we propose a QoS-aware dynamic multipath routing scheme for
enhancing QoS of high-bandwidth applications in an SDN-
enabled network. The proposed scheme consists of three phases –
ﬂow splitting, multipath routing, and ﬂow reordering. In the ﬁrst
phase, we propose a ﬂow splitting scheme to decide how to split the
incoming ﬂows to enable multipath routing in the network. In the
second phase, we design a cost function for routing the splittable
subﬂows and formulate a min-cost routing problem as an integer
linear program (ILP). To solve the problem in polynomial time,
we propose a greedy heuristic approach. Finally, in the third
phase, we propose a ﬂow reordering scheme for the received
subﬂows through multiple paths to maintain the desired ﬂow
sequence at the destination. The experimental results show that
the proposed scheme achieves higher network throughput by 22%
compared to the benchmark schemes. Further, the proposed
scheme achieves a reduction in QoS violated ﬂows by 24%
compared to the benchmark schemes."
88,Energy-and-delay-aware scheduling and load balancing in vehicular fog networks,"Abstract
Roadside units (RSUs) play an important role in the request fulﬁllment of vehicles. In rural areas, RSUs are powered by
renewable energy sources like solar energy. Hence, the request fulﬁllment of vehicles must be done in such a way that the
energy consumption across RSUs is minimized. The requests are categorized into traditional application (low computation)
requests and smart application (high computation) requests. To avoid excessive computation at RSUs, low computation
requests are scheduled across RSUs while high computation requests are scheduled across fog servers for processing. In
this paper, we propose an online energy-efﬁcient Inter-RSU Scheduling Algorithm (ee-IRSA) and a distributed Ant Colony
Optimization-based Load balancing technique (d-ACOL) for optimizing the request fulﬁllment of traditional and smart
application requests, respectively. ee-IRSA ensures minimum and uniform energy consumption across RSUs while d-ACOL
ensures minimum queue waiting time of requests across fog servers. In addition, a second-price auction game-based relay
vehicle selection technique is proposed which further minimizes the energy consumption of RSUs. Simulation results show
that ee-IRSA with relay vehicle selection reduces the energy consumption by 33%, and d-ACOL reduces the queue waiting
time by an average of 48% as compared to other load balancing techniques."
88,Federated Learning-based Air Quality Prediction for Smart Cities using BGRU Model,"ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) has become very popu-
lar due to its applications in various fields such as industry,
commerce, and education. Cities become smart cities by uti-
lizing lots of applications and services of IoT. However, these
intelligent applications and services significantly threaten
the environment regarding air pollution. Therefore, high
accuracy in air pollution monitoring and future air quality
predictions have become our primary concern to save hu-
man beings from health issues coming from air pollution. In
general, deep learning (DL) and federated learning (FL) tech-
niques are suitable for solving various forecasting problems
and dealing with the high volatile air components in het-
erogeneous big data scenarios. This ambiance of DL and FL
motivates us to exploit the DL-based Bidirectional Gated Re-
current Unit (BGRU) method for future air quality prediction
using big data and federated learning (FL) to train our model
in a distributed, decentral, and secure ways. This paper pro-
poses a novel distributed and decentralized FL-based BGRU
model to accurately predict air quality using the smart city’s
big data. The effectiveness of the FL-based BGRU Model is
estimated with other machine learning (ML) models by using
various evaluation metrics.

88,MobiCache: A Mobility-aware Caching technique in Vehicular Edge Computing,"ABSTRACT
Vehicular edge computing (VEC) brings computational re-
sources at the edge of vehicular networks (VANETs). In VEC,
the roadside unit (RSU) across the road segment acts as an
edge server. The vehicle having less computational capability
offloads high computation tasks to its nearby RSU for pro-
cessing. There is a significant energy consumption occurs
at the RSU in computing each high computation task. To
minimize the energy consumption, a caching technique is
used at RSUs. The greatest challenge of caching in VEC is the
mobility of vehicles. In this poster, we propose a Mobility-
Aware Caching technique (MobiCache) in VEC. MobiCache
uses an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework
to find the best routes for migrating the popular cache con-
tents of RSUs according to the mobility pattern of vehicles.
Simulation results show that our proposed caching strategy
reduces the energy consumption by an average of 39.54% as
compared to other existing caching techniques."
88,User authentication using Blockchain based smart contract in role-based access control,"Abstract
Since the last few decades, information security has become a significant challenge for organizations’ system administrators.
However, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model has emerged as a viable solution for organizations to meet the security
requirement due to its less administrative overhead. Blockchain technology is distributive and can be used effectively in user
authentication and authorization challenges. This paper proposes an RBAC model using a blockchain-based smart contract for
managing user-role permissions in the organization. We design a threat and security model to resist attacks such as man-in-the-
middle attacks in an organization scenario. The proposed approach uses the Ethereum blockchain platform and its smart contract
functionalities to model user-resource communications. The proposed method is tested on Ropsten Ethereum Test Network and
evaluated to analyze user authentication, verification, cost, and security."
88,A QoS-aware Routing based on Bandwidth Management in Software-Defined IoT Network,"Abstract—The burgeoning demands of the Internet of Things
(IoT) applications such as video/audio streaming in surveil-
lance, disaster recovery, multimedia, and healthcare paves
the need to provide better Quality of Service (QoS) delivery.
The growth in the amount of data generated by multimedia
applications increases congestion in the network. Software-
Deﬁned Networking (SDN) is an emerging approach that
centrally controls the network and solves the congestion prob-
lem in the network. SDN has many advantages that help
in network management, trafﬁc shaping, and routing in the
IoT network to manage the data generated from a diverse
range of applications. In this paper, we propose a congestion
technique using Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB) to manage
the bandwidth in the Software-Deﬁned IoT (SDIoT) network.
Further, we propose a routing scheme to compute optimal
routing shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm by selecting
the min-cost path based on the priorities of trafﬁc ﬂows.
The results illustrate that the proposed approach achieves a
reduction in end-to-end delay by 38%, 44% and higher average
throughput by 29%, 43% in comparison with the benchmark
schemes – SDN with HTB and the Delay Minimization method,
respectively."
88,A policy based framework for quality of service management in software defined networks,"Abstract
Growth in multimedia traffic over the Internet increases congestion in the network architecture. Software-Defined Network-
ing (SDN) is a novel paradigm that solves the congestion problem and allows the network to be dynamic, intelligent, and it 
centrally controls the network devices. SDN has many advantages in comparison to traditional networks, such as separation 
of forwarding and control plane from devices, global centralized control, management of network traffic. We design a policy-
based framework to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) of multimedia traffic flows in a potential SDN environment. We 
phrase a max-flow-min-cost routing problem to determine the routing paths and presented a heuristic method to route the 
traffic flows in the network in polynomial time. The framework monitors the QoS parameters of traffic flows and identifies 
policy violations due to link congestion in the network. The introduced approach dynamically implements policy rules to SDN 
switches upon detection of policy violations and reroutes the traffic flows. The results illustrate that the framework achieves 
a reduction in end-to-end delay, average jitter, and QoS violated flows by 24%, 37%, and 25%, respectively, as compared to 
the Delay Minimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach has achieved better results when compared to SDN 
without policy-based framework and reduced end-to-end delay, average jitter, and QoS violated flows by 51%, 62%, and 
28%, respectively."
88,Motion and Region Aware Adversarial Learning for Fall Detection with Thermal Imaging,"Abstract—Automatic fall detection is a vital technology for
ensuring the health and safety of people. Home-based camera
systems for fall detection often put people’s privacy at risk.
Thermal cameras can partially or fully obfuscate facial features,
thus preserving the privacy of a person. Another challenge is the
less occurrence of falls in comparison to the normal activities
of daily living. As fall occurs rarely, it is non-trivial to learn
algorithms due to class imbalance. To handle these problems,
we formulate fall detection as an anomaly detection within an
adversarial framework using thermal imaging. We present a
novel adversarial network that comprises of two-channel 3D
convolutional autoencoders which reconstructs the thermal data
and the optical ﬂow input sequences respectively. We introduce
a technique to track the region of interest, a region-based
difference constraint, and a joint discriminator to compute the
reconstruction error. A larger reconstruction error indicates the
occurrence of a fall. The experiments on a publicly available
thermal fall dataset show the superior results obtained compared
to the standard baseline."

SAtellite-based Marine Process Understanding, Development, Research and Applications (SAMUDRA) for blue economy,
a technology development program of the Space Applications Centre, is an umbrella program covering research and
applications geared toward physical and biological oceanography making use of current and future satellite observations
for developing the nation’s blue economy. The main motivation behind this project was to develop satellite and numerical
model-based information and value-added products and to demonstrate the implementation of developed applications for
operational requirements. The program also aimed at
improving existing methodologies for various applications
by utilizing space-based inputs. Several ﬁeld campaigns

Climate change (CC) is one of the most challenging problems of today which need to be 
understood. CC impact studies at the urban centres are the need of the hour. Mumbai is one 
of the most vulnerable port cities in the world and one of the most densely populated cities 
in the world. The city is vulnerable to CC-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm 
surge, flooding, and coastal erosion. In this study, it is tried to do the spatial integration 
of vulnerability from these hazards to portray the overall CC-induced impacts in Mum-
bai city. This study portraits the overall vulnerability of the Mumbai megacity, consider-
ing SLR, long-term coastal erosion, and flooding. This integrated vulnerability assessment 
reveals that 123.35 km2 (24%) of the Mumbai regions is demarcated as composite vul-
nerable regions. They are mostly around the coastal tracts. Within the vulnerable regions, 
inland flood-affected areas from the past floods area are 37.13 km2, which is around 30% 
of the demarcated most vulnerable regions. Remaining vulnerable areas are falling in built 
up, barren, forest, vegetation, and mangrove regions. The most worrying impact would be 
in the 44 km2 of the built-up areas, which is around 35% of the vulnerable regions. It pulls 
the city to one of the most vulnerable cities of the world due to the exposure of the higher 
population. Rest of all the classes can cope up as they are naturally covered, not covered, 
and the human population is not residing over those regions currently. Since the city is 
expanding rapidly, other LULC classes apart from built-up land have to be converted based 
on the need. Available barren land can be kept for rehabilitation in the future. This study 
provides vital information about the CC-induced vulnerability of Mumbai city."
89,"A new insight to vulnerability of Central Odisha coast, India using","Abstract
The occurrence of the PHAILIN, HUDHUD cyclones in the Bay of Bengal region highlights the importance of continuous
monitoring of this area from the coastal vulnerability perspective. The increase in the magnitude and frequency of coastal
disasters is estimated to cause disastrous effects on the ever-increasing coastal population as well as the natural resources that
are available in these regions. In this paper, the coastal vulnerability of a part of the Odisha coast, including the districts of
Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur, has been assessed on a relatively finer scale. These districts are reported to be the most vulnerable
areas along the Odisha coast. A set of Physical–geological parameters and socio-economic factors are used to derive the
vulnerability using AHP, and vulnerability maps are prepared to demarcate areas with different vulnerability. The Coastal
Vulnerability Index (CVI) finally is grouped into the three vulnerability classes for the final coastal vulnerability map.
Depending on this classification, approx. 35% of the coastline comes under high vulnerability, 39% under Medium and 26%
under low vulnerability class. The coastline adjoining, Teisimouza, Barunei, Paradip, are the highly vulnerable zones whereas the
shoreline between Jatardharmohan and Saharabedi comes under intermediate vulnerability zone. The results obtained can be used
for prioritization of the most sensitive areas in this coastal belt for better strategic management."

89,"Decadal shoreline assessment using remote sensing along the central Odisha coast, India","Abstract
One of the major requirements of planning
coastal protection works is to understand the processes of
erosion, deposition, sediment transport, ﬂooding and sea
level changes which continuously alter the shoreline. Sig-
niﬁcant erosion can affect the stability and productivity of
aquatic environment which may have severe implications
for coastal inhabitants. The middle coastal plains of Odisha
State on the east coast of India were investigated for
morphological assessment of shoreline. Accurate demar-
cations of shorelines were carried out at parts of Odisha
coast speciﬁcally along Gahirmatha, Paradip and coast
above Devi River to quantify erosion and accretion at
annual to decadal scale for the years 1990, 2000 and 2012.
Satellite-derived remote sensing data (Landsat and IRS P6)
were used in the study. Digital shoreline analysis system
discovered the eroded and accreted parts of the study area.
Gahirmatha and coast above Devi River experienced heavy
erosion during 2000–2012 compared with 1990–2000,
whereas
Paradip
coast
has
comparatively
undergone
accretion during 2000–2012. Some accreted spots are
identiﬁed nearby river mouths, which are attributed to
heavy accretion of eroded materials by the action of sedi-
ment transport. The detailed analysis reveals a maximum
erosion of 124, 33 and 154 m in a decade at Gahirmatha,
Paradip and coast above Devi River, respectively. Southern
parts of Gahirmatha coast showed highly dynamic behavior
near Hukitola Bay and Barrier Island and are acting as a
natural breakwater to conserve the shoreline. This region
had undergone severe geomorphologic changes due to
natural as well as human interventions and poses a threat.
This coast exhibits unique reasons for erosion with various
degrees of combinations of sediment depletion, human
activities, high frequency of cyclones and ﬂoods, sea level
rise, etc. This study concludes that the shoreline of Odisha
coast is under heavy erosion and needs scientiﬁc and
management attention."

The advancement of remote sensing technology and the analysing capability of Geographical Information 
System (GIS) can very well be used in the science of Archaeology.  Though these subjects look apart, they 
can be studied in conjunction with each other. The applications of remote sensing are vast and the field of 
archeology need not be left out in that. These techniques contribute to explore and understand the past. The 
improvement in the spatial and radiometric resolution helps in demarcating the sites of archeological 
importance and GIS helps to analyze with utmost accurate quantitative information. Mapping of 
geomorphological features, palaeo-channels, shift of shorelines, changes in the topographical features, 
identifying the potential archeological site from the spectral signatures are promising to use the latest remote 
sensing technology for the historic subject. In addition to the image interpretation techniques, vegetation 
marks, anomalous landforms, shifting of river mouths, palaeo coastlines help the archeologists for supporting 
their hypothesis. Synoptic coverage of images provides an opportunity to link it with historic evidences in a 
larger scale. Earlier archeological studies at Dwarka, Poompuhar, Tranqubar, Hampi etc used remote sensing 
and GIS. In this study, the power of remote sensing and GIS at the archeological studies at Gujarat and 
Tamilnadu will be described. The possibility of linking of Gulf of Kutch and Gulf of Khambhat in the past is 
explained with the support of digital elevation model from remote sensing data.  The historic Adam’s bridge 
and the mapping of it through remote sensing are also explained. This paper introduces remote sensing 
capability to Archeologists which can be used for their archeological explorations."

Coastal erosion is one of the major problems of the coastal zone. The erosion is triggered by various reasons such as 
high wave energy, reduction of sediments, natural disasters and climate change etc. In the era of industrialization, major 
infrastructure developments are happening along the coast. Prior to the initiation of those projects, it is important to 
understand the coastal processes of erosion, deposition, sediment-transport, flooding and sea-level-changes of the region 
which continuously alters the shoreline. These processes disturb the stability and productivity of aquatic environment 
and may have severe implications for proprietors. This study attempts morphological assessment of shoreline in the 
middle coastal plains of Odisha state on the east coast of India.  Shorelines changes study is carried out at Dhamra and 
Maipura Coast to quantify erosion and accretion during years 1990 – 2012.  Satellite derived remote sensing data of 
LANDSAT and IRS P6 for the years 1990, 2000 and 2012 were used in this study. Dhamra coast has been modified in 
between these years due to anthropogenic disturbance such as port development. Maipura coast which has large 
mangrove cover, Bhitarkanika national park carries its ecological importance. These coasts experienced erosion during 
2000-2012 compared to 1990-2000. Accretion is noticed in the nearby river mouths. Temporal variation of sediments and 
frequent flood events will also be discussed in the paper. The detailed analysis reveals that the maximum erosion of 227 
m, 47 m in a decade at Dhamra and Maipura coasts respectively.  Area of Dhamra coast was under accretion during 
1990-2000 and this area experienced erosion near Dhamra port just after the development of port in 2007. This study 
concludes that shoreline of study area is under high risk of erosion and inundation due to natural as well as 
anthropogenic activities in the area."

The opening and closure of coastal tidal inlets play a major role in regulating the water and sediment exchange between 
the river and ocean as well as in the interruption of the longshore sediment transport. The present work is an effort to 
understand the seasonal variations in the morphology of tidal inlets located on the east coast of India, which is often 
prone to cyclonic storms. An area comprising of two adjacent inlets located within 5 km, but with a different coastal 
orientation and estuary configurations is considered in this study. The two inlets considered in this study show different 
opening and closure conditions albeit similar offshore and hinterland conditions. A desktop study on the variations of 
general morphology changes of these two inlets is carried out using satellite images and GIS. Field investigations are 
carried out on the hydrodynamics inside the inlet comprising of water level variations and flow dynamics. Nearshore 
wave information is obtained by transforming the offshore waves using a calibrated global numerical model. This study 
includes field investigations in one of the bay area as well as in the coastal regions to understand the morphodynamics of 
these two inlets. This study would be one of the few works that would be addressing the inlet dynamics including field

90,Knowledge Tracing Based Wheel Spinning Detection Model in Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Abstract—The recent spread of Intelligent Tutoring Systems
(ITS) provides students with access to adaptive learning. How-
ever, existing ITS systems face significant challenges in student
supervision, primarily in designing robust detection models to
characterize the students’ learning state and to prevent students
from getting stuck in wheel spinning. To this end, this paper
proposes a wheel spinning detection model based on Mediating
Deep Knowledge Tracing (MDKT). First, the detection model
applies “student question mastery” as a mediator variable to
improve its interpretability. Specifically, we utilize a Classification
and Regression Tree (CART) in the detection model, which
enhances the model compatibility with a variety of data by
incorporating explicit features (e.g., hint usage). In addition, we
employ deep knowledge tracing to merge implicit time-dependent
features (e.g., students’ knowledge proficiency and forgetting) so
as to improve the detection accuracy. Finally, an interpretable
neural network based on logistic regression is applied to deter-
mine the probability of a student experiencing wheel spinning
behavior. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
interpretability of our wheel spinning detection model."
90,Cloud-Edge-Client Collaborative Learning in Digital Twin Empowered Mobile Networks,"Abstract— Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a key enabler
for the intelligent-oriented evolution of mobile networks. With
the rise of privacy concerns for enabling intelligent applications
in DT-empowered mobile networks (DTMNs), federated learning
has garnered wide attention due to its potential on breaking
down data silos. However, the data privacy of federated learning
is greatly threatened by emerging gradient leakage attacks, and
the need for frequent knowledge exchange limits its training
efficiency over resource-constrained DTMNs. To circumvent such
dilemmas, this work first proposes a privacy-enhanced federated
learning framework based on cloud-edge-client collaborations.
Particularly, model splitting between clients and edge servers
makes gradient leakage attacks computationally prohibitive, and
cloud-side partial model aggregation provides hierarchical data
utility. To improve the training efficiency of the proposed learning
framework, we further establish its communication and compu-
tation cost models, and develop a DT-assisted multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning-based resource scheduler for joint client
association and channel assignment. Finally, as a case study of
intelligent applications in DTMNs, a human-robot collaborative
nursing task is designed to evaluate the practical performance of
our proposed scheduler. Experimental results show its superiority
in saving training costs and preserving learning accuracy."
90,Cross-View Human Intention Recognition for Human-Robot Collaboration,"Abstract
Benefiting from the promise of sixth generation 
(6G) wireless networks, multimodal machine learn-
ing based on exploiting complementarity among 
video, audio, and haptic signals, becomes a key 
enabler for human intention recognition, which 
is critical to realize effective human-robot collab-
oration in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, as 
multimodal human intention recognition is limited 
by expensive equipment and a demanding envi-
ronment, it is hard to strike an efficient trade-off 
between inference accuracy and system overhead. 
Naturally, how to induce more intention semantics 
from readily available videos emerges as a funda-
mental issue for human intention recognition. In 
this article, we use cross-view human intention rec-
ognition to solve the above issue and demonstrate 
the effectiveness of our method with well-designed 
evaluation metrics. Specifically, we first compen-
sate for the scarcity of intention semantics in the 
body view by adding a face view. Second, we 
deploy the cross-view generative model to capture 
intention semantics induced by the mutual gen-
eration of two views. Finally, in the human-robot 
collaboration experiments, our method gets closer 
to human performance regarding response time 
and inference accuracy."
90,Cross-Modal Object Detection Via UAV,"Abstract—UAV-based object detection aims at locating and
recognizing targets in aerial images, which is widely applied to
trafﬁc surveillance, disaster rescue and anomaly monitoring.
However, due to expensive sensors and complicated architectures,
it is unrealistic to deploy precise but heavy multi-modal object
detectors into UAV nodes. To get over the dilemma, inspired by
model compression and cross-modal signal processing techniques,
this paper proposes a cross-modal knowledge distillation (CKD)
enabled object detection paradigm, which achieves comparable
detection performance with multi-modal techniques, yet requires
less computational resource. On the one hand, in order to
avoid transferring redundant feature knowledge, we design a
Selective Feature Imitation (SFI) to selectively shorten the distance
between cross-modal features according to their types. On the
other hand, in order to transfer the most valuable prediction
knowledge, we design an Adaptive Prediction Imitation (API). It
evaluates the quality of prediction knowledge, and then adaptively
adjusts the distillation intensity for cross-modal prediction.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset have shown
the performance improvement of the proposed scheme."
90,Edge-Based Cross-Modal Communications for Remote Healthcare,"Abstract—Medical robots with audio-video-haptic streams,
as indispensable devices for remote healthcare, are playing
ever-increasing roles in mitigating the spread of infectious dis-
eases. However, existing medical robots are far from precise
and efﬁcient because of the following two technical challenges,
including i) how to ensure the haptic ﬁdelity for precise manip-
ulation, and ii) how to alleviate the impact of haptic streams on
the quality of visual navigation for efﬁcient operation. To this
end, this work explores the beneﬁts of edge-based cross-modal
communications (CMCs), which take full advantage of potential
correlations among different modalities’ streams, to realize high
reliability and throughput. Speciﬁcally, to compensate for the
reliability loss caused by wireless transmission, a semantic-
aided cross-modal reconstruction framework is ﬁrstly designed
at edge nodes for high haptic ﬁdelity. Then, a user experience-
driven stream scheduling strategy is developed to enhance the
visual quality by fully leveraging edge computing and network
slicing. In particular, different from traditionally interrupting
audio/video stream transmission to prioritize haptic streams,
we jointly schedule resources to different modalities’ streams
via estimating haptic arrival time. Finally, as a classical case
study, we independently construct a remote throat swab sampling
platform based on CMCs to evaluate practical performance, and
numerical results indicate the signiﬁcant improvements in terms
of various metrics."
90,Haptic Signal Reconstruction in eHealth Internet of Things,"Abstract—With the haptic technology continuously enlarging
the eHealth Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem, hap-
tic perception service which requires effective haptic signal
reconstruction for immersive experience has become an indis-
pensable function. However, the majority of existing haptic
signal reconstruction methods are generally inefﬁcient because of
undergoing extremely complex operations or inefﬁcient feature
representations. To resolve this dilemma, this article proposes
a long short-term memory-based force reconstruction network
(LSTM-FRN) by designing a novel sparse attention module for
low-latency reconstruction and a novel metric learning-based
constraint for high-precision reconstruction, yielding an excel-
lent tradeoff between the computational complexity and feature
representation. To train our network, we construct a large-scale
data set of synchronous needle motion signals and haptic signals
in acupuncture needle insertion. Finally, we build an interactive
needle insertion training system (HapAR-NITS) by integrating
augmented reality (AR), the LSTM-FRN-based haptic recon-
struction as well as a skill assessment subsystem. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed multiple technolo-
gies enable our HapAR-NITS to achieve satisfying immersive
experience and manipulation effects."
90,A Virtual and Non-contact Bounce System Based on Ultrasonic Haptic Technology,"Abstract—Haptics 
has become an important research 
direction at the present stage. It is an inevitable trend to 
integrate haptic feedback into human-computer interaction 
technology in the future. However, traditional contact haptic 
feedback technology has disadvantages such as fixed equipment 
and limited space. In order to overcome this difficulty, this 
paper mainly studies the non-contact haptic feedback, and 
proposes a virtual bounce system based on ultrasonic haptic. 
First of all, we analyze the principle of the main modules of the 
system to provide a theoretical basis for the system design. 
Secondly, in the design, we combine tactile stimuli with visual 
stimuli to enhance the visualization and comfort of users during 
operation. Then, we analyze the performance of the system 
through experiment. The results show that the virtual bounce 
system proposed in this paper can free users from the shackles 
of devices, improve the interaction comfort and immersive 
experience of users."
90,A Solution of Human-Computer Remote Interaction with Tactile Feedback,"Abstract—In human-computer interaction, we need to use
human’s multiple sensory channels and motion channels to
improve its naturalness and efﬁciency. These channels include
voice, handwriting, posture, vision, expression, etc. Visual-based
human-computer interaction systems are often mentioned in the
literature. The system uses a camera to monitor and track the
operator’s posture, and sets corresponding commands to control
the movement of the robot. On top of that, we add tactile feedback
to allow the robot to accomplish more tasks. In the vision
system, ﬁrst we obtain color images and depth images through a
depth camera. Secondly, we estimate the human posture through
OpenPose. Finally, we map the motion of the human arm to
the motion of the robotic arm. In the tactile system, ﬁrst we
control the movement of the magic hand through the exoskeleton.
Secondly, we obtain the force values of the ﬁngers through the
magic hand. Finally, we provide force feedback to each ﬁnger
through the exoskeleton."
91,Premature jump-down mimicks nonlinear damping in,"Abstract
Recent experiments on nano-resonators in a bistable regime use the ‘jump-down’ point be-
tween states to infer mechanical properties of the membrane or a load, but often suggest the
presence of some nonlinear damping. Motivated by such experiments, we develop a mechanical
model of a membrane subject to a uniform, oscillatory load and linear damping. We solve this
model numerically and compare its jump-down behaviour with standard asymptotic predictions
for a one-dimensional Duffing oscillator with strain stiffening. We show that the axisymmetric,
but spatially-varying, problem can be mapped to the Duffing problem with coefficients deter-
mined rationally from the model’s Partial Differential Equations. However, we also show that
jump-down happens earlier than expected (i.e. at lower frequency, and with a smaller oscilla-
tion amplitude). Although this premature jump-down is often interpreted as the signature of
a nonlinear damping in experiments, its appearance in numerical simulations with only linear
damping suggests instead that indicate that the limitations of asymptotic results may, at least
sometimes, be the cause. We therefore suggest that care should be exercised in interpreting the
results of nano-resonator experiments.

Mechanical logic gates, whose embodiments were demonstrated in the past 
with rigid bodies connected with kinematic joints, are revisited in this work 
using compliant mechanisms. In particular, an OR gate is designed using 
pinned-pinned bistable arches. The compliant OR gate consists of five bistable 
arches arranged in such a way that a central arch acts as the output with 0 and 1 
stable states while two pairs of arches, with their own 0 and 1 states, act as 
inputs. The arch-profiles of all arches are designed so that the forces of 
switching and switching back between the two stable states and the travel 
between the two stable configurations are as per the desired functionality. An 
analytical method, which is based on linear superposition of buckling mode 
shapes of a straight pinned-pinned column, was used to design the arch-
profiles. Finite element analysis was used to validate the OR logic behaviour of 
the entire setup. A macro-scale prototype was made using 3D printing to 
demonstrate the working of the OR logic. Since mechanical gates are useful at

Arch-proﬁles of bistable arches, in their two force-free equilibrium states, are related to each other. This bilat-

91,A Two-Terminal Bistable Electrothermally Actuated Microswitch,"Abstract—An improved design of an electrothermally actuated
two-terminal bistable microswitch is the focus of this paper.
The proposed design has bimodal bistability which is obtained
by using a pair of arches, a V-beam electrothermal actuator,
and a novel initially retracting actuator. All these elements are
monolithically integrated in a single planar releasable layer. The
salient feature of the design is the usage of only a single pair of
electrodes to switch between ON and OFF states, even though there
are two actuators. In order to reduce the stress, the two actuators
are mechanically decoupled but are electrically coupled to satisfy
the two-terminal actuation. The switch design is experimentally
veriﬁed by realizing on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using
a single-layer micro-fabrication technique. An actuation voltage

The boundary conditions, as-fabricated shape, and height-to-depth ratio of an
arch characterize its bistability. We investigate this by modeling planar arches
with torsion and translational springs at the pin joints anchored to the ground.
A pinned-pinned arch, a special case of the model, has superior bistable char-
acteristics as compared to a ﬁxed-ﬁxed bistable arch, which is also a particular
case of the model. Arches with revolute ﬂexures at the ends retain bistable
characteristics of the pinned-pinned arches while being amenable for easy fabri-
cation. However, equilibrium equations for such arches become intractable for
analytical solution unlike the extreme cases of ﬁxed-ﬁxed and pinned-pinned
arches. Therefore, a semi-analytical method for analysis and shape-synthesis
of bistable arches with general boundary conditions is developed in this work.
This is done by numerically determining critical points in the force-displacement
curve. These critical points correspond to switching and switch-back forces and
travel between the two states thereby enabling synthesis for desired behavior.
We present design and optimization examples of bistable arches with a vari-
ety of boundary conditions and as-fabricated shape without prestress. We also
propose two approaches to design a new class of asymmetric bistable arches."

sign a bistable pinned-pinned arch with torsion springs at the pin (revo-
lute) joints. Finite, but not zero, values of torsion spring constants oﬀer
the dual advantage of being amenable to monolithic compliant bistable
arches wherein torsion springs are realized with equivalent revolute ﬂex-
ures; and giving enhanced range of travel between the stable states and
reduced switching forces. However, the equilibrium equations become in-
tractable for analytical solution unlike the extreme cases of ﬁxed-ﬁxed

designing novel bistable arches is presented here by determining critical
points in the force-displacement curve. First, the equilibrium equations
for post-buckling analysis are derived by writing the deﬂected proﬁle as
a linear combination of the buckling mode shapes of the corresponding
straight beam with torsion springs at the pinned ends. These equations
are then used to ﬁnd the critical points with maximum, minimum, and
zero forces. The critical points not only provide an approximate view of
the bistable force-displacement curve but also enable synthesis of arches
with desired behaviour. By using this semi-analytical method, we present
an example of an arch with reduced switching force, large switch-back
force, and enhanced travel between the two stable states."
91,1,"ABSTRACT 
In this paper, the load-deformation behaviour of a countersink screw lap joint is modelled 
using a spring-mass model to aid the analysis of aerospace structures. We do this by 
capturing the elasticity of the joint using linear translational springs. The stiffnesses of these 
springs are derived by modelling the stretching, bearing, shearing, and bending in the joint. 
The joint stiffness is then obtained by finding the combined effective stiffness of these 
springs. Furthermore, a finite element model (FEM) is used to numerically compute the joint 
stiffness of the model. We show that the analytical method is in good agreement with the 
finite element model."
91,"Title should be in Times New Roman font, size 14","Abstract 
 
In this paper, an initially straight beam with torsional springs at its two hinged 
ends is subjected to an axial force and its buckling mode shapes are found. Any 
shape which is a linear combination of the modes is taken as the as-fabricated 
stress-free form and then subjected to a transverse actuating force. Post-buckling 
analysis is used to compute the force-displacement characteristic of such a beam 
and thereby check if bistability exists. Two special cases of the torsion spring 
constants being very large and zero are presented. The former is a known result 
where a cosine curve is the fundamental buckling mode that does not give bistability 
unless its asymmetric second mode shape is avoided by a physical constraint. When 
the spring constant is zero, a single sine curve profile, which is the fundamental 
mode, can be made bistable without having to physically constrain the asymmetric 
buckling modes. This is realized when pinned-pinned boundary condition is used, 
which further allows the element to have enhanced range of travel between its two 
stable states, reduced switching force, and provision for secondary lateral actuation. 
To realise a monolithic compliant bistable element without any kinematic joints, 
torsion springs are substituted with equivalent revolute flexures. Physical 
embodiments of three types of bistable curved beams, namely, fixed-fixed, pinned-
pinned, and revolute flexure-based, are presented."

The concept of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has recently emerged as a new research area within the domain 
of digital twin technology. HDT refers to the replica of a physical-world human in the digital world. Currently, research 
on HDT is still in its early stages, with a lack of comprehensive and in-depth analysis from the perspectives of universal 
frameworks, core technologies, and applications. Therefore, this paper conducts an extensive literature review on HDT 
research, analyzing the underlying technologies and establishing typical frameworks in which the core HDT functions 
or components are organized. Based on the findings from the aforementioned work, the paper proposes a generic 
architecture for the HDT system and describes the core function blocks and corresponding technologies. Subse-
quently, the paper presents the state of the art of HDT technologies and their applications in the healthcare, indus-
try, and daily life domains. Finally, the paper discusses various issues related to the development of HDT and points

92,Adapting Image Classification Adversarial Detection Methods for Traffic Sign Classification in Autonomous Vehicles: A Comparative Study,"Abstract— Autonomous driving systems critically depend on
accurately classifying traffic signs, a task that is jeopardized
by adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on the relatively
unexplored domain of Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) in the
context of detecting adversarial attacks. We conduct a rigor-
ous evaluation of six prominent adversarial example detection
methods, each representing a distinct detection category and
well-regarded within the research community. Our methodology
involves adapting these techniques, originally developed for
general image classification (IC), to the unique challenges posed
by traffic sign images, characterized by their complexity due to
factors like varying environmental conditions and a large number
of classes. Our study reveals insights into their effectiveness, with
the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) method outperforming others
with 83.42%, 86.42%, and 99.96% detection rates; 0.08%, 0.05%,
and 0.04%, false positive rates; and 0.02sec, 0.01sec, and 0.02sec
detection times for Chinese, Belgium and German traffic sign
datasets, respectively. NSS’s superiority is crucial for autonomous
vehicles. Our study also sheds light on the often-neglected aspect
of detection time in IC, which plays a vital role in ensuring
operational efficiency and safety for autonomous vehicles. Our
research highlights the need for customized defense strategies
tailored to the TSC domain, considering our evaluation’s findings.
By identifying promising techniques for detecting adversarial
attacks in TSC, we contribute to enhancing the safety and robust-
ness of autonomous driving systems. This study fills a critical
knowledge gap, providing valuable insights into understanding
and defending against adversarial attacks, specifically in the TSC
context.

92,Biosignal Contrastive Representation Learning for Emotion Recognition of Game Users,"Abstract—Biosignal representation learning (BRL) plays a
crucial role in emotion recognition for game users (ERGU).
Unsupervised BRL has garnered attention considering the diffi-
culty in obtaining ground truth emotion labels from game users.
However, unsupervised BRL in ERGU faces challenges, including
overfitting caused by limited data and performance degradation
due to unbalanced sample distributions. Faced with the above
challenges, we propose a novel method of biosignal contrastive
representation learning (BCRL) for ERGU, which not only serves
as a unified representation learning approach applicable to vari-
ous modalities of biosignals but also derives generalized biosignals
representations suitable for different downstream tasks. Specifi-
cally, we solve the overfitting by introducing perturbations at the
embedding layer based on the projected gradient descent (PGD)
adversarial attacks and develop the sample balancing strategy
(SBS) to mitigate the negative impact of the unbalanced sample
on the performance. Further, we have conducted comprehensive
validation experiments on the public dataset, yielding the follow-
ing key observations: 1) BCRL outperforms all other methods,
achieving average accuracies of 76.67%, 7"
92,Improving completeness and consistency of co-reference annotation standard,"Abstract
As the processing power of mobile terminals increases, wireless network applications such as voice assistants can put more
context-sensitive tasks on the mobile terminals, thus reducing the wireless network bandwidth needed and the cost of data
storage in the cloud. Co-reference annotation, identifying the same semantics in context, is one of the critical techniques in
these tasks. However, there are some problems with the existing co-reference annotation standards. First, the annotation is
incomplete. Second, the types of annotated mentions are inconsistent. Third, there are currently no metrics for the above
characteristics. Analyzing the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a new co-reference annotation standard. The
new standard can annotate more semantics and co-reference relations and only adopts two types of mentions for annotation.
Meanwhile, this paper presents a performance evaluation corpus and designs three performance metrics for evaluating the
new standard according to the completeness of semantic annotation, the completeness of co-reference annotation, and the
consistency of mention. The experiment shows that the new standard outperforms all the baseline methods and achieves
0.95 in the completeness of semantic annotation, 0.68 in the completeness of co-reference annotation, and 0.57 in the
consistency of types of mentions."
92,Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Inference Task Scheduling and Offloading for Maximum Inference Accuracy under Time and Energy Constraints,"Abstract: The journey towards realizing real-time AI-driven IoT applications is facing a significant
hurdle caused by the limited resources of IoT devices. Particularly for battery-powered edge devices,
the decision between performing task inference locally or by offloading to edge servers, all while
ensuring timely results and conserving energy, is a critical issue. This problem is further complicated
when an edge device houses multiple local inference models. The challenge of effectively allocating
inference models to tasks between local models and edge server models under strict time and energy
constraints while maximizing overall accuracy is recognized as a strongly NP-hard problem and has
not been addressed in the literature. Therefore, in this work we propose MASITO, a novel multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning framework designed to address this intricate problem. By dividing
the problem into two sub-problems namely task scheduling and edge server selection we propose
a cooperative multi-agent system for addressing each sub-problem. MASITO’s design allows for
faster training and more robust schedules using cooperative behavior where agents compensate
for each other’s sub-optimal actions. Moreover, MASITO dynamically adapts to different network
configurations which allows for high-mobility edge computing applications. Experiments on the
ImageNet-mini dataset demonstrate the framework’s efficacy, outperforming genetic algorithms
(GAs), simulated annealing (SA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in scheduling times by
providing lower times ranging from 60% up to 90% while maintaining comparable average accuracy
in worst-case scenarios and superior accuracy in best-case scenarios."
92,Hybrid metaheuristics for selective inference task offloading under time and energy constraints for real-time IoT sensing systems,"Abstract
The recent widespread of AI-powered real-time applications necessitates the use of edge computing for inference task
ofﬂoading. Power constrained edge devices are required to balance between processing inference tasks locally or ofﬂoad to
edge servers. This decision is determined according to the time constraint demanded by the real-time nature of applications,
and the energy constraint dictated by the device’s power budget. This problem is further exacerbated in the case of systems
leveraging multiple local inference models varying in size and accuracy. In this work, we tackle the problem of assigning
inference models to inference tasks either using local inference models or by ofﬂoading to edge servers under time and
energy constraints while maximizing the overall accuracy of the system. This problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard and
therefore, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGSTO) to solve this problem. We leverage the speed of simulated
annealing (SA) with the accuracy of genetic algorithms (GA) to develop a hybrid, fast and accurate algorithm compared
with classic GA, SA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Experiment results show that HGSTO achieved on-par or
higher accuracy than GA while resulting in signiﬁcantly lower scheduling times compared to other schemes."

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effective-
ness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
However, the
lack of tourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist at-
traction presentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we
constructed a supervised fine-tuning dataset for the culture and tourism do-
main, named Cultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowl-
edge base QA data, travelogues data, and tourism diversity QA data. Ad-
ditionally, we propose TourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned
with Cultour, to improve the quality of the information provided about at-
tractions and travel planning. To evaluate the performance of TourLLM,
we employed both automatic and human evaluation, and we proposed a
human evaluation criterion named CRA (Consistency, Readability, Avail-
ability). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the re-
sponses generated by the TourLLM. Our proposed Cultour is accessible at
https://github.com/mrweiqk/Cultour."

92,ReLU-KAN: New Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Abstract
We propose a novel KAN architecture that replaces the original basis function
(B-spline) with a new one more suitable for parallel computation. The proposed
basis function is composed solely of matrix addition, dot product, and ReLU
activation, enabling efficient GPU parallelization. Unlike the static B-splines,
novel basis function incorporates two trainable hyperparameters that allow it to
dynamically adapt its shape and position to the specific fitting task. This adap-
tive capability gives ReLU-KAN a significant advantage in modeling complex
functions. Experimental results on a four-layer network show a 20-fold speedup in
backpropagation and a the accuracy is improved by two to three orders of magni-
tude compared to the original KAN. Notably, ReLU-KAN preserves the original
model’s ability to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The source code is available at

92,Blockchain-based optimized edge node selection and privacy preserved framework for federated learning,"Abstract
Federated learning is a distributed paradigm that trained large-scale neural network models with the participation of
multiple edge nodes and data remains on their devices, only sharing the local model updates. With this feature, federated
learning is considered a secure solution for data privacy issues. However, the typical FL structure relies on the client–server
architecture, which leads to the single-point-of-failure (SPoF) attack, and the random selection of edge devices for model
training compromised the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, adversaries try to initiate inference attack i.e., attack on
privacy leads to gradient leakage attack. Hence, we proposed a blockchain-based optimized edge node selection and
privacy-preserved framework to address the aforementioned issues. We have designed three kinds of smart contracts (1)
registration of edge nodes (2) forward bidding to select optimized edge devices for FL model training, and (3) payment
settlement and reward smart contracts. Moreover, fully homomorphic encryption with the Cheon, Kim, Kim, and Song
(CKKS) method is implemented before transmitting the local model updates to the server. Finally, we evaluated our
proposed method on the benchmark dataset and compared it with other state-of-the-art studies. Consequently, we have
achieved a higher accuracy and privacy-preserved FL framework with a decentralized nature."
92,Anomaly detection and defense techniques in federated learning: a comprehensive review,"Abstract
In recent years, deep learning methods based on a large amount of data have achieved sub-
stantial success in numerous fields. However, with increases in regulations for protecting 
private user data, access to such data has become restricted. To overcome this limitation, 
federated learning (FL) has been widely utilized for training deep learning models without 
centralizing data. However, the inaccessibility of FL data and heterogeneity of the client 
data render difficulty in providing security and protecting the privacy in FL. In addition, 
the security and privacy anomalies in the corresponding systems significantly hinder the 
application of FL. Numerous studies have been proposed aiming to maintain the model 
security and mitigate the leakage of private training data during the FL training phase. 
Existing surveys categorize FL attacks from a defensive standpoint, but lack the efficiency 
of pinpointing attack points and implementing timely defenses. In contrast, our survey 
comprehensively categorizes and summarizes detected anomalies across client, server, and 
communication perspectives, facilitating easier identification and timely defense measures. 
Our survey provides an overview of the FL system and briefly introduces the FL security 
and privacy anomalies. Next, we detail the existing security and privacy anomalies and the 
methods of detection and defense from the perspectives of the client, server, and communi-
cation process. Finally, we address the security and privacy anomalies in non-independent 
identically distributed cases during FL and summarize the related research progress. This 
survey aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of security and privacy 
research in FL to help understand the progress and better apply FL in additional scenarios.

92,Energy-Aware Selective Inference Task Offloading for Real-Time Edge Computing Applications,"ABSTRACT IoT has recently witnessed a boom in AI deployment at the edge as a result of the newly
developed small size Machine Learning (ML) models and integrated hardware accelerators. Although it
brings huge benefits such as privacy-preserving and low-latency applications, it still suffers from typical
resource limitations of edge devices. A new approach aims to deploy multiple inference models varying in
size and accuracy onboard the edge device which could alleviate some of these limitations. This dynamic
system can be leveraged to provide real-time energy efficient application by smartly allocating inference tasks
to inference local models or offload to edge servers based on current constraints. In this work, we tackle the
problem of efficiently allocating inference models for a given set of inference tasks between local inference
models and edge server models in parallel under given time and energy constraints. This problem is considered
strongly NP-hard and therefore we propose LITOSS, a 2-stage framework in which we use a lightweight
Genetic Algorithm-based schemer for task scheduling along with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for
improving edge server selection. We perform experiments using a raspberry pi with a set of edge servers.
Results show that our framework performed relatively faster compared to other meta-heuristic schemes such
as LGSTO, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) while providing higher
average accuracy. We also show that using an RL agent to select the best subset of available edge servers
increased, or maintained in worst cases, the average accuracy while reducing the average scheduling times."

92,MCformer: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting With Mixed-Channels Transformer,"Abstract—The massive generation of time-series data by large-
scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates the exploration
of more effective models for multivariate time-series forecasting.
In previous models, there was a predominant use of the channel
dependence (CD) strategy (where each channel represents a
univariate sequence). Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
primarily rely on the channel independence (CI) strategy. The
CI strategy treats channel multichannel series as separate single-
channel series, expanding the data set to improve generalization
performance and avoiding interchannel correlation that disrupts
long-term features. However, the CI strategy faces the challenge
of interchannel correlation forgetting. To address this issue, we
propose an innovative Mixed Channels strategy, combining the
data expansion advantages of the CI strategy with the ability
to mitigate interchannel correlation forgetting. Based on this
strategy, we introduce MCformer, a multivariate time-series
forecasting model with mixed channel features. The model blends
a speciﬁc number of channels, leveraging an attention mechanism
to effectively capture interchannel correlation information when
modeling long-term features. Experimental results demonstrate
that the Mixed Channels strategy outperforms pure CI strategy
in multivariate time-series forecasting tasks."
92,"A tree-based corpus annotated with Cyber-Syndrome, symptoms, and acupoints","abstract, virtual, digital space based on various infrastructures, equipment, software, and hardware. The 
emergency of cyberspace has modified how humans interact, reshaping traditional communication media such 
as cinema, television, music, and the telephone. In cyberspace, information can be exchanged regardless of 
time and space, and the information exchanged has the advantages of time-domain (fast update), interactivity 
(human-to-human and human-to-information interaction), diversity of forms (e.g. pictures, videos, voice, etc.), 
and outstanding personalization. As a result, it attracts many users to participate in it. People also spend more 
and more time in cyberspace. As the size of cyberspace users continues to expand and the time spent in cyber-
space gradually increases, Cyber-Syndrome deserves the growing attention of more and more people.
In 2018, our group defined the concept and connotation of Cyber-Syndrome. Namely, Cyber-Syndrome is 
a physical, social, and mental disorder that affects humans due to misuse of technology or excessive interaction 
with cyberspace2 For example, the occurrence of computer neck due to prolonged low-headed use of electronic 
devices; Computer spondylosis is caused by continuous Internet access and improper posture for a significant 
period; Prolonged intensive, repetitive, and excessive finger movements can cause wrist joint paralysis and pain, 
increase the incidence of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, etc. There are many types of Cyber-Syndrome and a variety 
of pathogenic factors, such as occupation, family environment, and personal habits that can catalyze the onset of 
Cyber-Syndrome. Cyber-Syndrome threatens people’s physical and mental health and can be life-threatening in 
severe cases. However, Cyber-Syndrome has not been systematically outlined, numerous scientific papers have 
experimentally demonstrated that prolonged or excessive Internet use can lead to Cyber-Syndrome, and elec-
tronic clinical records have shown that some Cybe-Syndrome causation is related to inappropriate interactions 
in cyberspace, and different Cyber-Syndrome have different clinical manifestations. Currently, These data and 
information exist in an unstructured form and a fragmented state.

proposed NLP models4 Therefore, we aim to create a golden corpus annotated with Cyber-Syndrome, signs, and 
symptoms. Scholars can use NLP techniques to extract relevant information, enrich the knowledge system of 
Cyber-Syndrome, and raise awareness of Cyber-Syndrome for better adaptation to cyberspace.
Besides, how to effectively treat Cyber-Syndrome is becoming a common problem for global cyberspace 
users. Disease treatment is divided into two perspectives: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western 
medicine, which are two completely different systems, from the way of thinking to the treatment methods are 
not the same. Since Cyber-Syndrome is formed by long-term chronic accumulation, treatment with TCM is 
more suitable for the prevention and treatment of Cyber-Syndrome. The theory of meridians and acupoints is 
one of the fundamental theories of TCM. There are unique spots on the meridians that are neither isolated from 
the body’s surface but are closely connected and interconnected with deep tissues and organs, i.e. acupoints. 
On the one hand, it reflects disease and pain; on the other hand, it can undergo stimulation to prevent and treat 
disease. Not all diseases can be cured by acupoint therapy, but acupoints have a remarkable effect in alleviating 
the symptoms of diseases. Therefore, we established a tree-based corpus by acquiring a corpus of acupoints and 
automating the mapping of acupoints that can alleviate the symptoms of Cyber-Syndrome.
This paper integrates the disease corpus included in Cyber-Syndrome to construct a Cyber-Syndrome corpus 
and constructs an acupoint corpus to alleviate the Cyber-Syndrome symptoms from the perspective of TCM. 
The CS-A corpus connects the Cyber-Syndrome corpus and the acupoint corpus using the hierarchical structure 
of a tree, and manually annotates key entities such as Cyber-Syndrome, symptoms, and acupoints, as well as the 
relationships that exist between the entities. This paper presents the annotation process and guidelines in detail 
and consistently analyzes the annotation results with 86.05% agreement rate.
Methods
Data sources and preparation. 
Cyber-Syndrome.  Prolonged or excessive interaction with cyberspace 
can easily result in physiological and psychological disorders of users, which we call Cyber-Syndrome. To facili-
tate the study of Cyber-Syndrome, we generalized the diseases belonging to Cyber-Syndrome from the published 
studies. We constructed a Cyber-Syndrome lexicon to prepare data for the pre-annotation of the CS-A corpus. 
We systematically searched the Science Citation Index Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. 
By conducting the meta-analysis of clinical trial results, scholars are able to collect statistics and analyze a large 
number of individual studies to get more objective findings, which is the highest level of the evidence-based 
medicine hierarchy. Based on the meta-analysis results, we summarized the various diseases encompassed by 
Cyber-Syndrome, mainly divided into physiological and psychological disorders.
Physiological disorders are usually the result of a malfunction of a body organ, non-functioning or changes 
in the actual cellular structure over a while that cause illness. Psychological disorders are characterized by a 
clinically significant impairment in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior. It is usually 
associated with distress or impairment in critical areas of functioning. We compiled a list of physiological dis-
orders (see Table 1) and a list of psychological disorders (see Table 2) encompassed by the Cyber-Syndrome 
through the results of a meta-analysis of the literature. To improve the consensus of Cyber-Syndrome inter-
nationally, a coarse-grained classification of physiological and psychological disorders of Cyber-Syndrome is 
made by utilizing the ICD-11 issued by the World Health Organization (i.e., the root nodes of various disorders 
in the ICD-11). Meanwhile, each file of the Cyber-Syndrome corpus was named using the unique code of MeSH 
(Medical Subject Headings), published by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and is currently the most 
authoritative and commonly used standard medical subject headings.
Apart from Table 1, which presents the set of physiological disorders obtained by meta-analysis, other 
pieces of evidence from the literature also provide the basis for physiological disorders due to excessive inter-
action with cyberspace. For example, the skin diseases it causes include erythema [D004890], acne rosacea 
[D012393], pruritus [D011537], seborrheic dermatitis [D012628], atopic dermatitis [D003876], acne vul-
garis [D000152], etc.5 Mental, behavior, or neurodevelopmental disorders include mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) [D060825], Alzheimer’s disease [D000544], amnesia [D000647], and so on6 Disorders of the

that solves the problems of network navigability and provides enhanced service discovery and composition.
It aims to socialize the IoT devices and allow them to interact just like humans by creating multiple social
relationships. In SIoT scenarios, a device can offer multiple services, and different devices can offer the same
services with different parameters and factors of interest, which leads to data sparsity and sheer volume of
services. However, this sheer volume of available services makes it difficult for devices to navigate and select
the ones that best fit their needs or preferences. On the other hand, the heterogeneous nature and dynamic
connectivity of SIoT networks raise the cold start problem in service recommendations. Few works explored
the integration of trust-aware approaches with latent feature mining in the SIoT recommendation systems.
To address these challenges, we proposed a hybrid latent feature mining and trust-aware model to provide
a tailored service recommendation in the SIoT environment. Experimental results conducted on a public
dataset reveal the increase of service recommendation accuracy and highlight the proposed framework’s
effectiveness in meeting recommendation needs within the scope of SIoT environment."
92,Efficient fog node placement using nature-inspired metaheuristic for IoT applications,"Abstract
Managing the explosion of data from the edge to the cloud requires intelligent supervision, such as fog node deployments,
which is an essential task to assess network operability. To ensure network operability, the deployment process must be
carried out effectively regarding two main factors: connectivity and coverage. The network connectivity is based on fog
node deployment, which determines the network’s physical topology, while the coverage determines the network acces-
sibility. Both have a signiﬁcant impact on network performance and guarantee the network quality of service. Determining
an optimum fog node deployment method that minimizes cost, reduces computation and communication overhead, and
provides a high degree of network connection coverage is extremely hard. Therefore, maximizing coverage and preserving
network connectivity is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose a fog deployment algorithm that can effectively
connect the fog nodes and cover all edge devices. Firstly, we formulate fog deployment as an instance of multi-objective
optimization problems with a large search space. Then, we leverage Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) to tackle the
deployment problem and prove that MPA is well-suited for fog node deployment due to its rapid convergence and low
computational complexity, compared to other population-based algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on
a different benchmark of generated instances with various fog scenario conﬁgurations. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-
the-art methods, providing promising results for optimal fog node deployment. It demonstrates a 50% performance
improvement compared to other algorithms, aligning with the No Free Lunch Theorem (NFL Theorem) Theorem’s
assertion that no algorithm has a universal advantage across all problem domains. This underscores the signiﬁcance of
selecting tailored algorithms based on speciﬁc problem characteristics."

(HAR) is a critical research domain in activity perception.
However, achieving high efficiency and long sequence recog-
nition remains a challenge. Despite the extensive investigation
of temporal deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and
transformers, their extensive parameters often pose significant
computational and memory constraints, rendering them less
suitable for resource-constrained mobile health applications. This
study introduces HARMamba, an innovative light-weight and
versatile HAR architecture that combines selective bidirectional
State Spaces Model and hardware-aware design. To optimize real-
time resource consumption in practical scenarios, HARMamba
employs linear recursive mechanisms and parameter discretiza-
tion, allowing it to selectively focus on relevant input sequences
while efficiently fusing scan and recompute operations. The model
employs independent channels to process sensor data streams,
dividing each channel into patches and appending classification
tokens to the end of the sequence. It utilizes position embedding to
represent the sequence order. The patch sequence is subsequently
processed by HARMamba Block, and the classification head fi-
nally outputs the activity category. The HARMamba Block serves
as the fundamental component of the HARMamba architecture,
enabling the effective capture of more discriminative activity
sequence features. HARMamba outperforms contemporary state-
of-the-art frameworks, delivering comparable or better accuracy
with significantly reducing computational and memory demands.
It’s effectiveness has been extensively validated on 4 publically

93,Mobilytics: Mobility Analytics Framework for Transferring Semantic Knowledge,"Abstract—The proliferation of sensor-equipped smartphones has led to the generation of vast amounts of GPS data, such as
timestamped location points, enabling a range of location-based services. However, deciphering the spatio-temporal dynamics of
mobility to understand the underlying motivations behind travel patterns presents a significant challenge. This paper focuses on how
individuals’ GPS traces (latitude, longitude, timestamp) interpret the connection and correlations among different entities such as
people, locations or point-of-interests (POIs), and semantic contexts (trip-purpose). We introduce a mobility analytics framework,
named Mobilytics designed to identify trip purposes from individual GPS traces by leveraging a “mobility knowledge graph” (MKG) and
a deep learning architecture that automatically annotates the GPS log. Additionally, we propose a novel “transfer learning” approach to
explore movement dynamics in a geographically distant area by leveraging knowledge obtained from a comparable region, such as an
academic campus. In terms of major contributions and novelty, this is the first work to present end-to-end daily mobility trip purpose
extraction and mobility knowledge transfer for trip annotation and POI-tagging where the labeled data are insufficient. Experimental
results on real-life datasets of five different regions demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Mobilytics framework which outperforms
the baselines for trip-purpose extraction and POI annotations by a significant margin (≈18% to ≈30%). Moreover, the analysis on
huge volume of simulated traces (10,000 users) illustrates the scalability and robustness of the framework."
93,PromptFix: Few-shot Backdoor Removal via Adversarial Prompt Tuning,"Abstract
Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have at-
tracted enormous attention over the past few
years with their unparalleled performances.
Meanwhile, the soaring cost to train PLMs
as well as their amazing generalizability have
jointly contributed to few-shot fine-tuning
and prompting as the most popular training
paradigms for natural language processing
(NLP) models. Nevertheless, existing studies
have shown that these NLP models can be back-
doored such that model behavior is manipu-
lated when trigger tokens are presented. In this
paper, we propose PromptFix, a novel back-
door mitigation strategy for NLP models via
adversarial prompt-tuning in few-shot settings.
Unlike existing NLP backdoor removal meth-
ods, which rely on accurate trigger inversion
and subsequent model fine-tuning, PromptFix
keeps the model parameters intact and only
utilizes two extra sets of soft tokens which ap-
proximate the trigger and counteract it respec-
tively. The use of soft tokens and adversarial
optimization eliminates the need to enumerate
possible backdoor configurations and enables
an adaptive balance between trigger finding and
preservation of performance. Experiments with
various backdoor attacks validate the effective-
ness of the proposed method and the perfor-
mances when domain shift is present further
shows PromptFix’s applicability to models pre-
trained on unknown data source which is the
common case in prompt tuning scenarios.

93,Clock against Chaos: Dynamic Assessment and Temporal Intervention in Reducing Misinformation Propagation,"Abstract
As social networks become the primary sources of informa-
tion, the rise of misinformation poses a significant threat to
the information ecosystem. Here, we address this challenge
by proposing a dynamic system for real-time evaluation and
assignment of misinformation scores to tweets, which can
support the ongoing efforts to counteract the impact of misin-
formation public health, public opinion, and society. We use a
unique combination of Temporal Graph Network (TGN) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture both structural
and temporal characteristics of misinformation propagation.
We further use active learning to refine the understanding of
misinformation, and a dual model system to ensure the accu-
rate grading of tweets. Our system also incorporates a tem-
poral embargo strategy based on belief scores, allowing for
comprehensive assessment of information over time. We fur-
ther outline a retraining strategy to keep the model current and
robust in the dynamic misinformation landscape. The evalu-
ation results across five social media misinformation datasets
show promising accuracy in identifying false information and
reducing propagation by a significant margin."
93,1,"Abstract—With the increasing availability of diverse data
types, particularly images and time series data from medical
experiments, there is a growing demand for techniques designed
to combine various modalities of data effectively. Our motivation
comes from the important areas of predicting mortality and
phenotyping where using different modalities of data could sig-
nificantly improve our ability to predict. To tackle this challenge,
we introduce a new method that uses two separate encoders, one
for each type of data, allowing the model to understand complex
patterns in both visual and time-based information. Apart from
the technical challenges, our goal is to make the predictive
model more robust in noisy conditions and perform better
than current methods. We also deal with imbalanced datasets
and use an uncertainty loss function, yielding improved results
while simultaneously providing a principled means of modeling
uncertainty. Additionally, we include attention mechanisms to
fuse different modalities, allowing the model to focus on what’s
important for each task. We tested our approach using the
comprehensive multimodal MIMIC dataset, combining MIMIC-
IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. Our experiments show that our
method is effective in improving multimodal deep learning for
clinical applications. The code will be made available online.

93,WordGame: Efficient & Effective LLM Jailbreak via,"Abstract
The recent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
revolutionized every industry at an unprecedented pace. Alongside this progress
also comes mounting concerns about LLMs’ susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks,
which leads to the generation of harmful or unsafe content. While safety alignment
measures have been implemented in LLMs to mitigate existing jailbreak attempts
and force them to become increasingly complicated, it is still far from perfect. In
this paper, we analyze the common pattern of the current safety alignment and show
that it is possible to exploit such patterns for jailbreaking attacks by simultaneous
obfuscation in queries and responses. Specifically, we propose WordGame attack,
which replaces malicious words with word games to break down the adversarial
intent of a query and encourage benign content regarding the games to precede the
anticipated harmful content in the response, creating a context that is hardly covered
by any corpus used for safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
WordGame attack can break the guardrails of the current leading proprietary and
open-source LLMs, including the latest Claude 3, GPT 4, and Llama 3 models
more effectively than existing attacks efficiently. Further ablation studies on such
simultaneous obfuscation in query and response provide evidence of the merits
of the attack strategy beyond an individual attack. Warning: The paper contains
unfiltered text generated by LLMs which can be offensive.

93,Uncovering Human Traits in Determining Real and Spoofed Audio: Insights from Blind and Sighted Individuals,"ABSTRACT 
This paper explores how blind and sighted individuals perceive 
real and spoofed audio, highlighting diferences and similarities 
between the groups. Through two studies, we fnd that both groups 
focus on specifc human traits in audio–such as accents, vocal 
infections, breathing patterns, and emotions–to assess audio au­
thenticity. We further reveal that humans, irrespective of visual 
ability, can still outperform current state-of-the-art machine learn­
ing models in discerning audio authenticity; however, the task 
proves psychologically demanding. Moreover, detection accuracy 
scores between blind and sighted individuals are comparable, but 
each group exhibits unique strengths: the sighted group excels at 
detecting deepfake-generated audio, while the blind group excels 
at detecting text-to-speech (TTS) generated audio. These fndings 
not only deepen our understanding of machine-manipulated and 
neural-renderer audio but also have implications for developing 
countermeasures, such as perceptible watermarks and human-AI 
collaboration strategies for spoofng detection.

Teaching is one of many professions for which personalized feed-

their data in practice remain. In this paper, we present ClassInSight, 
a tool that visualizes three levels of teachers’ discussion data and 
structures refection. Through 22 refection sessions and interviews 
with 5 high school science teachers, we found themes related to 
dissonance, contextualization, and sustainability in how teachers 
engaged with their data in the tool and in how their professional

93,Pruning as a Domain-specific LLM Extractor,"Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhib-
ited remarkable proficiency across a wide ar-
ray of NLP tasks. However, the escalation in
model size also engenders substantial deploy-
ment costs. While few efforts have explored
model pruning techniques to reduce the size
of LLMs, they mainly center on general or
task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal
performance due to lacking specificity on the
target domain or generality on different tasks
when applied to domain-specific challenges.
This work introduces an innovative unstruc-
tured dual-pruning methodology, D-PRUNER,
for domain-specific compression on LLM. It ex-
tracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-
agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights
that are pivotal for general capabilities, like lin-
guistic capability and multi-task solving, and
domain-specific knowledge. More specifically,
we first assess general weight importance by
quantifying the error incurred upon their re-
moval with the help of an open-domain cali-
bration dataset. Then, we utilize this general
weight importance to refine the training loss,
so that it preserves generality when fitting into
a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently
approximating weight importance with the re-
fined training loss on a domain-specific cali-
bration dataset, we obtain a pruned model em-
phasizing generality and specificity. Our com-
prehensive experiments across various tasks
in healthcare and legal domains show the ef-
fectiveness of D-PRUNER in domain-specific
compression. Our code is available at https:

93,Deriving Entity-Specific Embeddings from Multi-Entity Sequences,"Abstract
Underpinning much of the recent progress in deep learning is the transformer architecture, which takes as
input a sequence of embeddings E and emits an updated sequence of embeddings E′.
A special [CLS]
embedding is often included in this sequence, serving as a description of the sequence once processed and
used as the basis for subsequent sequence-level tasks. The processed [CLS] embedding loses utility, however,
when the model is presented with a multi-entity sequence and asked to perform an entity-specific task. When
processing a multi-speaker dialogue, for example, the [CLS] embedding describes the entire dialogue, not any
individual utterance/speaker. Existing methods toward entity-specific prediction involve redundant computation or
post-processing outside of the transformer. We present a novel methodology for deriving entity-specific embeddings
from a multi-entity sequence completely within the transformer, with a loose definition of entity amenable to
many problem spaces. To show the generic applicability of our method, we apply it to widely different tasks:
emotion recognition in conversation and player performance projection in baseball and show that it can be used to
achieve SOTA in both. Code can be found at https://github.com/c-heat16/EntitySpecificEmbeddings."
93,Embedding and Clustering Multi-Entity Sequences,"ABSTRACT Core to much of modern deep learning is the notion of representation learning, learning
representations of things that are useful for performing some task(s) related to those things. Encoder-only
language models, for example, learn representations of language useful for performing language-related
tasks, often classification. While fruitful in many applications, inherent is the assumption that only one
classification is to be made for a particular input. This poses challenges when multiple classifications are
to be made about different portions of a single record, such as emotion recognition in conversation (ERC)
where the objective is to classify the emotion in each utterance of a dialog. Existing methods for this task
typically either involve redundant computation, non-trivial post-processing outside of the core language
model backbone, or both. To address this, we generalize recent work for deriving player-specific embeddings
from multi-player sequences of events in sport for domain-agnostic application while also enabling it to
leverage inter-entity relationships. Seeing the efficacy of the method in regression and classification tasks,
we explore how it can be used to cluster player representations, proposing a novel approach for distribution-
aware deep-clustering in the absence of labels. We demonstrate how the proposed methods yield state-
of-the-art performance on the disparate tasks of ERC in Natural Language Processing (NLP), long-tail
partial-label-learning (LT-PLL) in Computer Vision (CV), and player form clustering in sports analytics.

93,WildGraph: Realistic Graph-based Trajectory Generation for Wildlife,"ABSTRACT
Trajectory generation is an important task in movement studies; it
circumvents the privacy, ethical, and technical challenges of collect-
ing real trajectories from the target population. In particular, real
trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical
and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this
paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajecto-
ries, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples.
We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement
characteristics of the real dataset, and recursively refine localized
regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path
into a prototype network of H31 regions and leverages a recurrent
variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over
the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates
realistic months long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60.
Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demon-
strate that our proposed method improves the generalization of
the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work, while
achieving superior or comparable performance in several bench-
mark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository:

93,Data Disparity and Temporal Unavailability Aware Asynchronous Federated Learning for Predictive Maintenance on Transportation Fleets,"Abstract
Predictive maintenance has emerged as a critical application
in modern transportation, leveraging sensor data to forecast
potential damages proactively using machine learning. How-
ever, privacy concerns limit data sharing, making Federated
learning an appealing approach to preserve data privacy. Nev-
ertheless, challenges arise due to disparities in data distribu-
tion and temporal unavailability caused by individual usage
patterns in transportation. In this paper, we present a novel
asynchronous federated learning approach to address sys-
tem heterogeneity and facilitate machine learning for predic-
tive maintenance on transportation fleets. The approach intro-
duces a novel data disparity aware aggregation scheme and a
federated early stopping method for training. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on two indepen-
dent real-world datasets from the transportation domain: 1)
oil dilution prediction of car combustion engines and 2) re-
maining lifetime prediction of plane turbofan engines. Our
experiments show that we reliably outperform five state-of-
the-art baselines, including federated and classical machine
learning models. Moreover, we show that our approach gen-
eralises to various prediction model architectures."
93,PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character,"Abstract
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an established task with the objective of identifying the text present in an
image. While many off-the-shelf OCR models exist, they are often trained for either scientific (e.g., formulae) or
generic printed English text. Extracting text from chemistry publications requires an OCR model that is capable in
both realms. Nougat, a recent tool, exhibits strong ability to parse academic documents, but is unable to parse tables
in PubMed articles, which comprises a significant part of the academic community and is the focus of this work.
To mitigate this gap, we present the Printed English and Chemical Equations (PEaCE) dataset, containing both
synthetic and real-world records, and evaluate the efficacy of transformer-based OCR models when trained on this
resource. Given that real-world records contain artifacts not present in synthetic records, we propose transformations
that mimic such qualities. We perform a suite of experiments to explore the impact of patch size, multi-domain
training, and our proposed transformations, ultimately finding that models with a small patch size trained on multiple
domains using the proposed transformations yield the best performance. Our dataset and code is available at
https://github.com/ZN1010/PEaCE."
93,Applications of Representation Learning Methods in,"ABSTRACT
In the realm of sports analytics, players, teams, and managers have primarily been evaluated through a set of summary
counting statistics. Typically, these statistics describe the number of times various events occurred on the ﬁeld of play, perhaps
dividing one quantity by another and/or applying some statistical adjustment. Recent works have proposed viewing the game
as a sequence of events towards identifying speciﬁc items of interest, such as the players being in a certain formation on the
ﬁeld. However, this sequential, contextual understanding of the game is abandoned once the item of interest is identiﬁed.
We speculate performance can be gained by leveraging this sequential, contextual understanding of the game. In this work
we demonstrate how a rich, event-by-event understanding of a sport, in this case professional baseball, can provide utility
in the tasks of player performance projection and clustering. In the process of doing so, we also demonstrate how ﬁndings
in the domain of sports can translate to state-of-the-art advances in more traditional disciplines of study - speciﬁcally, the
natural language processing task of emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) and the computer vision task of long-tail
partial-label-learning (LT-PLL)."
93,Automated Multi-Task Learning for Joint Disease,"Abstract
Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become a rich source of information with
the potential to improve patient care and medical research. In recent years, machine
learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients’ future
health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning
(MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction
performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for
EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts
to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce
human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated
approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of
task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search
space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate
model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution.
Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed AutoDP framework. It achieves significant performance improvements
over both hand-crafted and automated state-of-the-art methods, also maintains a
feasible search cost at the same time.

93,WildGEN: Long-horizon Trajectory Generation for Wildlife,"ABSTRACT
Trajectory generation is an important concern in pedestrian, ve-

enrich the training corpus in relation to deep learning applications,
and may be used to facilitate simulation tasks. This is especially
significant in the wildlife domain, where the cost of obtaining addi-
tional real data can be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and
bear ethical considerations. In this paper, we introduce WildGEN: a
conceptual framework that addresses this challenge by employing a
Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs) based method for the acquisition
of movement characteristics exhibited by wild geese over a long
horizon using a sparse set of truth samples. A subsequent post-
processing step of the generated trajectories is performed based on
smoothing filters to reduce excessive wandering. Our evaluation is
conducted through visual inspection and the computation of the
Hausdorff distance between the generated and real trajectories. In
addition, we utilize the Pearson Correlation Coefficient as a way to
measure how realistic the trajectories are based on the similarity of
clusters evaluated on the generated and real trajectories."

knowledge extraction framework does not require huge amounts
of labelled tweets of different categories (our method uses only 50-
labelled tweets for each of 15 misinformation categories, in stark
contrast to existing approaches that typically rely on 10,000 or
more labelled tweets), and (ii) our module outperformed baselines

94,Impact of Electrode Patterns Variation on the Response Characteristic of Leaf Wetness Sensors,"Abstract—Prediction of plant diseases is essential to reduce crop
loss. Early disease prediction models have been investigated for
this purpose, where data on leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one
of the key components. Leaf wetness sensors (LWSs) are used to
better understand how foliar wetness affects plant disease cycles
and epidemic development. LWS can be fabricated on printed
circuit boards (PCBs), where interdigitated electrode patterns are
widely used. However, it is important to understand the efﬁcacy
of these patterns for in-situ measurements. For this purpose, in
this work, we have fabricated three different patterns viz. circular,

dry-to-wet range, which is about 2 and"
94,Investigating an Impact of Leaf Bending Radius and Angle for Flexible Leaf Wetness Sensor,"Abstract—It is pivotal to monitor and examine the plant disease during in situ measurements
to abate the crop loss. For this purpose, leaf wetness sensors (LWS) are widely used. How-
ever, for the LWS during in situ measurements, operational exposure is always a concern
considering the plant growth at different stages. During the plant growth, the stem angle
changes and even the leaf canopy bends either inward or outward due to environmental
factors or physical trauma. Thus, LWS placed on the leaf canopy may produce erroneous
results. In this letter, we have examined the effect of leaf bending radius (outward or inward) and angle (from
0° to 90°) on the ﬂexible LWS fabricated on the polyamide substrates. LWS comprises of interdigitated electrodes
(IDEs) having interelectrode spacing 0.05 cm. Fabricated LWS are 3.5 cm long and"
94,Environmental and Soil Parameters for Germination of Leaf Spot Disease in the Groundnut Plant Using IoT-Enabled Sensor System,"Abstract—Groundnut cultivation faces persistent challenges from
leaf spot disease, which affects crop yield and quality. This letter
investigates the inﬂuence of environmental and soil parameters on the
germination of leaf spot disease in groundnut plants where the Internet
of Things (IoT)-enabled sensor system is used to collect the data. A
sensor array consisting of soil moisture, soil temperature, leaf wetness
sensor (LWS), ambient temperature, and ambient humidity sensors
are deployed to monitor critical environmental and soil factors. The
aforementioned sensors collectively provide comprehensive insights
into the conditions conducive to disease germination. Real-time data collection is achieved by deploying the IoT-enabled
system, which collects the soil moisture, soil temperature, LWS, ambient temperature, and ambient humidity information
and uploads them on the Thingspeak cloud. Field measurements indicates that the temperature (27 °C–32 °C), the length
of LWS (0–10 h), high humidity (73% RH or more), soil moisture (4%–6%), and soil temperature (19 °C–20 °C) all have
a signiﬁcant impact on the germination of leaf spot disease infection. These results are incorporated into the creation of
the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, where accuracy of about 85.51% is achieved. The values of precision, recall, and
F1-score are 87.54%, 84.21%, and 85.84%, respectively, achieved for the proposed MLP model. Further, the presence of
the disease has been validated by collecting the images during the in-situ measurements. The ﬁndings enhance our under-
standing of disease dynamics and offer practical implications for precision agriculture and disease management strategies."
94,Impact of Annealing on Soil Moisture Sensing Properties of Graphene Oxide,"Abstract— Soil moisture is one of the important parameters 
for precise irrigation models. In this work, we have fabricated 
the graphene oxide (GO) based soil moisture sensor and 
considered the effect of the annealing on the soil moisture 
sensing properties. For this purpose, first, we have prepared 
the sensor where we have taken three derivatives of the GO 
viz. GO prepared at room temperature (25 0C), GO annealed 
at 50 oC, and 90 oC. Further, these three forms of GO are drop 
casted on the IDEs fabricated on the silicon substrates and 
explored the sensor’s transfer function characteristics. Lab 
measurements results indicate that the fabricated sensors offer 
a response of about ≈ 384 %, ≈ 306 %, and ≈ 224 %, when the 
gravimetric water content (GWC) is varied from"
94,Extracting Leaf Wetness Duration using Baseline Correction through Group-Sparse Total Variation Method for LW Sensor,"Abstract— Today’s sensor-driven technological era has 
enabled modernization in the agriculture sector. Plant 
disease detection technologies play a pivotal role in 
considering crop loss due to fungal diseases, weeds, or pests. 
To detect plant-fungal disease, it is essential to measure the 
leaf wetness duration (LWD) on the leaf, for which leaf 
wetness sensors (LWS) are widely used. In this work, an in-
house, capacitive electronic leaf wetness sensor has been 
used along with interface electronics and deployed close to 
the mango plant. Further, the data are collected for about 
one week and applied Group-Sparsity Total Variation (GS-
TV) pre-processing data algorithms to extract the LWD 
information from the self-collected data. We found that GS-
TV outperforms extracting LWD when compared with the 
other data pre-processing methods such as TV, Savitzky-
Golay Filter, 1-dimension median filter, and Wavelet-based 
considering the accuracy. To benchmark the measured LWD 
from the fabricated LWS, we also deployed commercially 
available Phytos-31 LWS. Field measurement results 
indicate that developed LWS measures LWD with a 
maximum discrepancy of about ± 30 minutes compared with 
commercially available LWS."

94,Experimental Investigation of Leaf Wetness Sensing Properties of MoS<sub>2</sub> Nanoflowers-Based Flexible Leaf Wetness Sensor,"Abstract—To abate crop loss, it is important to explore the plant disease management systems, where leaf wetness
sensors (LWS) are widely used. The leaf wetness duration (LWD) extracted from the LWS is related to plant diseases. In
this work, we have fabricated the LWS on the polyamide ﬂexible substrate where Molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2) is used
as the sensing ﬁlm to explore the leaf wetness sensing mechanism. Further, we have passivated the MoS2 with the help
of acrylic protective lacquer (APL) conformal coating (MoS2 + APL), which reduce the interaction of the water molecules
with the sensor. Lab measurements indicated that fabricated LWS on the ﬂexible substrate with MoS2 and MoS2 + APL
as the sensing ﬁlm offers a response of about ≈40 000% and ≈250%, respectively, at 500 Hz excitation frequency when
the entire sensing area is ﬁlled with the water molecule. The response time of the MoS2 and APL-coated ﬂexible sensor is
about 180 s. Fabricated LWS sensors offer hysteresis of about ± 4% in wetness. Further, we have identiﬁed that oxidation
of the sulphur in the MoS2 plays an important role in the leaf wetness sensing mechanism. Furthermore, we understood
that MoS2 when passivated with APL coating, the oxidation effect is reduced and the sensor response is negligible."
94,Attention-Based Multi-Input Multi-Output Neural Network for Plant Disease Prediction Using Multisensor System,"Abstract—Disease detection and prevention in plants
are crucial for generating healthy crops and securing the
livelihood of farmers. Leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
temperature, and relative humidity (RH) are essential parame-
ters that lead to the germination of fungal diseases in plants.
In this work, an in-house-developed leaf wetness sensor
(LWS) is used to capture LWD, and commercial temperature
and humidity sensors are used to record the ambient
temperature and humidity, respectively. Subsequently, these
sensors are interfaced with an in-house-developed Internet of
Things (IoT)-enabled electronics and deployed (three sensor
nodes) in the ﬁeld. We have proposed an attention-based multi-input multi-output neural network (A-MIMONN) to predict
diseases using self-collected data. The data for training the model are collected from the three sensors nodes, each
comprising of temperature, humidity, and LWSs. The designed network is an ensemble of various submodels, trained
individually using data from different sensor nodes. The ﬁndings of these individually trained networks are then combined
to give the ﬁnal output. The network is designed to achieve better results by employing the attention mechanism,
reinforcing the inﬂuence of the most important feature on the predicted results. The average accuracy of the model
was found to be about 94%. The model displayed a high average precision of 96% and a high average recall value of 97%.
The average F1 score of 97% indicated an excellent balance of precision and accuracy."
94,Field Evaluation of Smart Sensor System for Plant Disease Prediction Using LSTM Network,"Abstract—Leaf wetness duration (LWD), soil moisture,
soil temperature, ambient temperature, and relative humidity
information are the essential factors that leads to germination
of plant disease. In this work, an internet of things (IoT)
enabled leaf wetness sensor (LWS) and soil moisture sen-
sor (SMS) is developed. Subsequently, commercial soil tem-
perature (ST), relative humidity (RH) and ambient temperature
(AT) are used for plant disease prediction. The developed LWS
offers a response of about 250% when exposed to air and
water and response time of about 20 seconds and attributes
a hysteresis of about ±3 %. Acrylic protective lacquer (APL) coating of about 25-75 μm thin is deposited on LWS and
it is observed that the sensor capacitance changes only by 2% when temperature varies from 20 ◦C to 65 ◦C. Likewise,
fabricated SMS offers a response of 10 kHz (F) with only a 2% change in frequency when temperature varies from
20 ◦C to 65 ◦C and works with an accuracy of ±3%. Further, aforementioned sensors along with in-house developed IoT-
enabled system has been deployed under ﬁeld conditions for about four months. In this work, we considered Powdery
mildew (D1), Anthracnose (D2), and Root rot (D3) disease on the Mango plant. Further, we have implemented the Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) network which performs better compared to the existing methods discussed on plant disease
management. The proposed network achieves an accuracy of 96%, precision-recall and F1 score of 97%, 98%, and 99%,
respectively."
94,"IoT Enabled, Leaf Wetness Sensor on the Flexible Substrates for <italic>In-Situ</italic> Plant Disease Management","Abstract—Early plant disease detection and providing the
control measures have become highly desirable to improve
crop yield. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one of the essential
parameters related to the development of fungal disease on
the leaf canopy. To measured LWD, the leaf wetness sen-
sor (LWS) is widely used. Commercially available LWS are
made on printed circuit board (PCB) technology, which has
an operational issue during ﬁeld deployment such as weight
of the sensor, contact resistance between the sensor and the
leaves, form factor and most importantly, affordability. To mit-
igate the issues associated with the commercially available
LWS, in this work, we have fabricated the in-house IoT-enabled
and affordable electronic leaf wetness sensor on the ﬂexible
substrates, which is used for integrated plant disease management. Fabricated LWS comprises the interdigitated
electrodes (IDEs) on the polyimide ﬂexible substrate. The lab measurement results indicate that fabricated LWS on the
ﬂexible substrates offers a response of about 36000% when LWS is exposed to water w.r.t air. The observed response
time of the fabricated LWS is about 10 seconds and hysteresis of about ± 4 %. Further, sensor capacitance changes only
by 6% over a temperature range from 20 ◦C to 65 ◦C. Furthermore, three fabricated sensors LWS and in-house developed
internet of things (IoT) enabled systems are deployed on the Ocimum tenuiﬂorum (Tulsi) medical plant. Field measurement
indicates that measured LWD using the fabricated ﬂexible LWS and commercially available LWS (Phytos 31:LWS-L12),
METER Group, Inc. USA) shows the absolute difference of 30 minutes."
95,CAN RADAR BACKSCATTER RATIO BE USED TO ESTIMATE NDVI AND ACT AS ,"ABSTRACT: 
The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from optical satellite images plays a very important role in determining 
the state of plants' health. Also, it is an important parameter needed in various statistical/process-based models. However, the use of 
optical images is sometimes limited because of atmospheric conditions and cloud cover. On the other hand, synthetic aperture radar 
(SAR) remote sensing has been widely used for crop monitoring due to its high-resolution imaging and all-weather data acquisition 
capabilities. So, if the SAR backscatter response (σ0) and NDVI data could be correlated, it is possible to estimate NDVI (during 
complete or partial stages of crop development) under overcast situations. In this study, three different experiments have been 
performed to establish the relationship between NDVI-σ0VV, NDVI-σ0VH, and NDVI-σ0VV/σ0VH. Here, time-series σ0 (in VV and VH 
polarizations) and NDVI were extracted from Sentinel-1 and Senitnel-2, respectively. Based on the analysis, it is found that the NDVI 
is more closely correlated with the ratio σ0VV/σ0VH than it is with σ0VV and σ0VH when data points from the start of cropping season up 
to the start of the maturity stage of the crop, were considered (referred to as experiment 2 and experiment 3). This is opposed to 
experiment 1, which took into account all data points related to the crop's development i.e. start of cropping season up to the harvesting 
stage of the crop. The best results were obtained from experiment 3 in which higher-order polynomial regressions were developed 
between NDVI and σ0VV/σ0VH. A significant correlation ranging from R2 = 0.81 to 0.98 were observed for NDVI-σ0VV/σ0VH. The study 
was conducted on selected farms located in the same agro-climatic zone during the Rabi season of 2018-19."
95,Estimation of Wheat Crop Height Using Multivariate Regression and Sentinel-1-Derived Radar Backscatter Response,"ABSTRACT 
In this study, we used time-series radar backscatter 
response in VV and VH polarizations (i.e. σ°VV and 
σ°VH) and ground-based wheat height data to establish 
the multivariate regression models for wheat height 
estimate. For generating time-series σ°VV and σ°VH, the 
C-band Sentinel-1 satellite data were used. The ground 
height observation was obtained from the farm having 
Durum wheat variety HI 8759 (also known as Pusa 
Tejas). We experimented with five different 
multivariate regression models (MVRM) using 
combinations of independent variables i.e. σ°VV, σ°VH, 
σ°VV/σ°VH ratio, and days after sowing (DAS). Based 
on the combination of variables, the five models can be 
depicted as MVRM1 (σ°VV, σ°VH, and DAS), MVRM2 
(σ°VH and DAS), MVRM3 (σ°VV and DAS), MVRM4 
(σ°VV and σ°VH) and MVRM5 (σ°VV/σ°VH ratio and 
DAS). Based on statistical observation, it is found that 
although the model R2 for MVRM1 and MVRM2 was 
about 0.90, the condition number is very high in both 
cases, which causes multicollinearity. This leads to 
model overfitting. On the other hand, model R2 
obtained for MVRM3, MVRM4, and MVRM5 are 
0.94, 0.65, and 0.93 respectively and all the models are 
free from multicollinearity as the condition number is 
low. Another observation shows that DAS is an 
important variable in the regression model along with 
the backscatter response. Overall, based on the 
statistical parameters, MVRM3 and MVRM5 were 
found suitable for wheat height estimation. This 
particular model was validated on an independent 
wheat farm and found encouraging results.

95,Machine Learning-Based Approach for Tillage Identification Using Sentinel-1 Data,"ABSTRACT 
Agriculture tillage is a fundamental practice in farming that 
involves preparing the soil for planting crops. It has been 
an essential technique used by farmers for centuries to 
improve soil conditions, increase crop yields, and enhance 
overall agricultural productivity. While tillage information 
can be acquired through manual field data collection, 
implementing 
this 
approach 
consistently 
and 
systematically over a wide area poses considerable 
challenges. Instead, remote sensing methods offer a viable 
option to comprehensively, promptly, and affordably 
investigate tillage activities. Hence, there is significant 
value in embracing a remote sensing approach to 
consistently and methodically monitor tillage practices 
across various fields. The objective of this research was to 
determine different types of tillage surfaces by analyzing 
the radar backscatter response received from the ground. 
The study used data from the Sentinel-1 satellite, 
specifically the Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) Ground 
Range Detected (GRD) dataset, which provided radar 
measurements in both VV and VH polarizations. To 
monitor tillage, we utilized supervised classification 
methods, namely decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), 
and support vector machine (SVM). Among these 
classifiers, the RF has the highest test accuracy of 0.86. The 
obtained results were validated using the ground 
observation data and found encouraging."
95,Detection of Cover Crop Using Time-Series Remote Sensing Observations,"ABSTRACT
Vegetation cover plays a crucial role in enriching the soil car-
bon content. The sequestered CO2 gets released due to ex-
posure of soil to the atmosphere by the process of volatiliza-
tion. Therefore, there is a need to monitor sustainable farm
management practises like cover cropping. Remote Sensing
coupled with artificial intelligence helps in non-invasive mon-
itoring of vegetation cover. The main objective of this study
is to detect the presence of cover crop using the time-series
of remote sensing observations. The study was carried out on
selected fields from the Europe region. A total of 60 fields
from four countries, namely, France, Germany, Poland, and
Spain during 2019–2021 were selected. In this study we pro-
posed a two-step approach for cover crop detection. The first
step involves separating vegetation period from fallow/bare
soil and snow cover. The second step has mainly focused on
the vegetation period to initially separate main crop period
and subsequent detection of cover crop for the remainder of
the vegetation period. Combination of index based threshold-
ing and phenology indicators was used for cover crop detec-
tion. The proposed approach was validated using the ground
reference data on presence or absence of a cover crop. Re-
sults showed an overall accuracy of 9"
95,Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon and Bulk Density for Carbon Stock Assessment in Croplands Using the Sentinel-1 and 2 Observations,"ABSTRACT
Remote sensing coupled with machine learning is useful for
non-invasive monitoring and prediction of Soil Organic Car-
bon (SOC) and carbon stock. The use of Sentinel-1 and 2
datasets was attempted in this work for SOC, Bulk Density
(BD), and carbon stock estimation. The key objective of this
study is to estimate Soil Organic Carbon and Bulk Density
for carbon stock assessment in croplands using multi-spectral
and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite observations.
The fields from Colorado and Nebraska states are selected,
and assessment is performed after the harvest of the cropping
season in 2020. Soil samples were collected during 10-30
Oct 2020. Regression models were developed using bands
and indices derived from Sentinel-1 and 2 datasets as indepen-
dent variables, however SOC or BD were used individually as
dependent variables. Models were developed by considering
data from individual states and then combining all the data us-
ing Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Re-
gression (SVR). Results for the SOC estimation showed that
RFR performed better than SVR with individual state data.
Lowest RMSE achieved using the RFR were 0.114 and 0.159
for fields from Nebraska and Colorado states. However, SVR
outperformed over RFR in the case of BD estimation using
the combined data from both states (RMSE = 0.24). Further
comparison between estimated carbon stock and actual car-
bon stock at field level shows the good agreement over fields
from Colorado compared to Nebraska."
95,SOYBEAN CROP YIELD PREDICTION BY INTEGRATION OF REMOTE SENSING AND,"ABSTRACT:
The main objective of this study is the in-season forecasting of soybean crop yield using the integration of satellite remote sensing
and weather observations. The study was carried out in the Paran´a state of Brazil. The soybean crop in the study region is
sown during Oct.–Nov. month and harvested between Feb.–Mar. of the next year. Municipality-level soybean yield data for 15
municipalities was obtained from the AGROLINK portal of Brazil, from the 2005–06 season to the 2020–21 season. The crop
yield data constituted yearly municipality-wise yield in kg/ha. Remote sensing-based indicators such as the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Rainfall data from CHIRPS
was considered in the study. Regression modelling was carried out between municipality-level yield as the dependent variable
and features generated from remote sensing and weather observations as independent variables. Performance evaluation of tuned
random forest regression (RFR) and tuned support vector regression (SVR) were performed against multiple linear regression
(MLR). A comparison of results in terms of algorithms shows that RFR performed better than SVR and MLR. Further, a root-
mean-square-error (RMSE) of 414 kg/ha and an R2 value of 0.748 were achieved by the best RFR model. Validation of developed
RFR model was performed on the data from the new soybean season, i.e., 2020–2"

95,Detection Of Crop Water Stress In Maize Using Drone Based Hyperspectral Imaging,"ABSTRACT
Crop water stress is one of the major factors limiting crop pro-
ductivity. Maize (Corn) crop is very sensitive to water stress.
Efficient monitoring and detection of water stress is crucial
for precision irrigation and sustainable agriculture. The main
objective of this study is to detect water stress during grain-fill
stage in maize crops using hyperspectral (HS) observations.
Maize hybrid field trial plots were selected from Hyderabad
region, Telangana, India. HS images of the study area were
collected using a hexacopter drone mounted with line scan-
ning HS camera having spectral range of 450-950 nanometer
(nm). The line scanning HS drone observations were pro-
cessed for georeferencing, mosaicing, and ortho-rectification.
The study area was divided into two sub-plots, viz. control
(i.e., no stress) and water stress during grain-fill stage of the
crop. Each plot had 66 sub-plots, each representing a unique
variety. Visual spectral analysis was performed to identify
the differences and spectral regions suitable for water stress
detection. Analysis revealed that the visible region around
680 nm and the Red-Edge (RE) - Near-InfraRed (NIR) re-
gion were providing the differences between the no-stress and
water stressed plots. The optimal subset of wavelength re-
gions were identified using machine learning (ML) based fea-
ture selection. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) classifiers were used to assess the feasibility of
the chosen bands. SVM with top 10 bands in the range of
670–780 nm found most effective for detecting grain-fill wa-
ter stress in maize crop varieties."
95,Spatial Downscaling of Vegetation Optical Depth Using the Modis and Srtm Observations,"ABSTRACT
The optical satellite observations are affected by cloud cover.
Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) has the potential to provide
insights into plant water and vegetation structure. The main
objective of this study is to spatially downscale VOD using
a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and
Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) observations.
The study considered India geography and post-monsoon
cropping season (locally called Rabi season). Data for three
different Rabi crop seasons, i.e., 2017–18, 2018–19, and
2019–20, was used in the analysis. The VOD estimates at 25
km scale derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave
Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) were used for spatial
down-scaling.
Three day VOD composites were created
to cover the study area. MODIS products such as Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference
Water Index (NDWI), albedo (black and white sky), and Land
Surface Temperature (LST) were similarly acquired at a 3-
day interval by constructing a 3-day composite. In addition,
SRTM digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 90
m was used in this study. We carried out regression modeling
where VOD was used as a dependent variable, with NDVI,
NDWI, Albedo (black and white sky), LST, and elevation
as independent variables.
We compared three regression
algorithms, viz., Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Re-
gression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), using
the R-square (R2) as the assessment metric. A comparison
between the various regression techniques showed that the
SVR outperformed monthly and seasonal models. Further-
more, a comparison of monthly and seasonal models revealed
that the model generated with January data performed best,
with an R2 of 0.85, followed by R2 of 0.82, 0.80, and 0.78
for March, December, and February, respectively. The R2 for
the seasonal model was 0.83. Finally, for the wheat crop time
series of down-scaled VOD and Sentinel 2 based NDVI was
compared to gain insights on seasonal variations in VOD. We
found that down-scaled VOD and NDVI have a significant
agreement."

was conducted over India during the post-monsoon (i.e., Rabi) season Daily SMAP soil moisture (SM) data was composited to 3
days to cover the entire study area. MODIS data for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference
Water Index (NDWI), Albedo, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were similarly obtained by constructing a three day composite.
SMAP soil moisture was used as a dependent variable, whereas, MODIS NDVI, NDWI, Albedo, LST, and SRTM elevation were
used as independent variables in a regression analysis for downscaling of SMAP soil moisture. The coefficient of determination
(R2) was used to evaluate the performance of multi-variate linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random
forest regression (RFR). Each method was used to test the performance of monthly and seasonal models. RFR outperformed MLR
and SVR for monthly and seasonal models. Furthermore, a comparison of monthly and seasonal models revealed that the model
created on Jan. data performed best (R2=0.80), while R2 of 0.73, 0.61, 0.75, and 0.76 were attained using RFR for seasonal, Dec.,
Feb., and Mar. models, respectively. In addition, in-situ soil moisture data was used to validate downscaled soil moisture (1 km).
Comparison between downscaled soil moisture and in-situ soil moisture showed good agreement with a difference ranging between
-9.3 to 7.4 %."
95,ESTIMATION OF NDVI FOR CLOUDY PIXELS USING MACHINE LEARNING,"ABSTRACT:
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a useful index for vegetation monitoring. However, due to cloud cover the
observations of NDVI are discrete and vary in the intensity. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the NDVI during cloud cover
using alternative sources of satellite observations. The main objective of this study is to estimate NDVI during cloudy conditions
using moderate resolution multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. Two approaches were identified: 1)
pixel replacement and 2) machine learning based regression analysis to estimate cloud free NDVI. Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day NDVI composite, Sentinel-1 SAR and cloud masked Sentinel-2 multi-spectral observations were
collected for entire cropping season. The satellite observations were selected only for agricultural areas by applying the agriculture,
non-agriculture land use land cover mask. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression
(RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used for NDVI estimation. Regression analysis was performed using Sentinel-2
NDVI as an independent variable and VV, VH, Cross Ratio (i.e., VV/VH), and MODIS NDVI as dependent variables. NDVI of
the cloudy pixel was estimated using the trained regression models over the agriculture areas. A regression model was trained and
applied to each Sentinel-2 tile that covers an area of 100 km x 100 km. The RFR and SVR showed the highest R2 of 0.73 and a
RMSE of 0.12. A visual comparison of time series graphs showed good alignment between actual (Sentinel-2) and predicted NDVI
and usual crop growth trend."
95,DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED SATELLITE DATA DOWNLOADING AND ,"ABSTRACT: 
 
Remote sensing satellites allow users to acquire detailed information about the Earth's surface on a temporal basis. Widen time-
series analysis at a large geographical scale involves a huge amount  (in Terabytes) of satellite data downloading and processing 
operations. Such processes need good computational power, large storage, and sophisticated tools. Maintaining such infrastructure 
can cost heavily to the research/commercial enterprises. To overcome such issues, Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a 
sophisticated cloud computing environment. We developed an in-house automated satellite data downloading and processing 
(ADDPro) pipeline on the AWS platform. The ADDPro pipeline employed Sentinel-2 satellite data to offer current and relative 
vegetation health information of the agriculture region on a temporal basis at the pan-India scale. Image compositing and multi-
sensor data fusion technique have been incorporated into the ADDPro pipeline to produce cloud-free raster (GeoTIFF) outputs. 
ADDPro pipeline also facilitates lossless raster data compression, which reduces AWS data transfer costs between regions. Data 
compression also aids in reducing raster publishing time on GeoServer. Operationally, AWS allows users to download only the 
bands required to generate a certain index (e.g. NDVI) rather than the entire Sentinel-2 data package. The entire ADDPro pipeline 
is extremely cost-effective, efficient, and scalable.

95,Impact of lockdown and crop stubble burning on air quality of India: a case study from wheat-growing region,"Abstract  The emergence of COVID-19 has brought 
the entire planet to a halt. Many countries, includ-
ing India, were compelled to shut down most urban, 
industrial, social and other activities as a result of 
the pandemic. Due to a series of complete lock-
downs imposed in India from March 24 to May 17, 
2020, and state-wise local level restrictions afterward, 
have resulted in significant reduction of emissions of 
numerous atmospheric pollutants. The objective of 
this study is to analyse the change in concentration 
of various pollutants such as nitrogen oxide ­(NO2), 
carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth 
(AOD) due to lockdown and also to quantify the con-
tribution of crop stubble burning to air pollution. The 
Sentinel-5P based ­NO2 and CO observations for 2019 
and 2020 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer (MODIS)-based AOD observations for 
2016–2020 were used for detecting the variations. 
The obtained results showed a significant decrease in 
­NO2 levels during various stages of lockdown. Small 
decrease in CO levels was observed across most part 
of the India. With a few exceptions, such as coastal 
and desert regions, there was a moderate decrease in 
AOD levels. Furthermore, to study the contribution 
of ­NO2, CO and AOD from crop stubble burning,

95,Simulation of Sentinel-2 data using Hyperspectral Data for Bare Surface Soil Moisture Estimation,"Abstract—Soil moisture is one of the driving variables for
precision irrigation management, drought assessment etc. Various
approaches for measuring and monitoring soil moisture have
been devised in the past, including laboratory techniques, point-
based sensors, and remote sensing. However, the use of simulated
optical data for bare surface soil moisture estimation is limited
to date. The main objective of this study is the assessment
of simulated Sentinel-2 data for bare surface soil moisture
estimation. Hyperspectral soil moisture data provided by [1] in
the spectral range of 450-950 nm over the test site in Germany
has been utilized in this study. Hyperspectral images (50 x 50
pixels) were captured using the Cubert UHD 285 hyperspectral
snapshot camera. The data available for public use consist of
mean spectra of soil surface (average of 50 x 50 pixels) in 125
spectral bands. Simulation of 8 bands (B2-B8A) of Sentinel-
2 covering the same spectral range as that of hyperspectral
camera was carried out using spectral response curve of Sentinel-
2. Random Forest Regression based model was developed using
all bands. Moreover, important features were selected based on
a percent increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE). Selected
bands include B2, B4, B5 and B7. Evaluation of models developed
using all the 8 bands and selected 4 bands was carried out using
the independant testing data based on Root Mean Sqaure Error
(RMSE). We have obtained an RMSE of"
95,Field Boundary Identification using Convolutional Neural Network and GIS on High Resolution Satellite Observations,"Abstract—With advent of constellation of high-resolution micro
satellites, the acquisition rate of earth observation has surpassed
the rate of data processing. In semi-arid rainfed agricultural
ecosystems area under crop varies across seasons. Due to small
land holdings it’s often difﬁcult to identify the ﬁeld level crop
cultivation information. Also, ﬁeld boundaries are important for
identiﬁcation of crop extent, crop insurance, crop loan, carbon
credit and to establish the credit score for the farm. Studies
have reported effective edge detection using Deep Learning based
classiﬁers. Geographic Information System (GIS) based topology
operations for vector geometry are effective in correction of
vector geometries.
This study describes ﬁeld boundary identiﬁcation approach
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on high resolution
satellite observations. A Holistically-nested Edge Detection algo-
rithm is used to identify the edge raster images. The pixel error
rate of 19% was obtained with 200 epochs and 131 training
images. Finally, the edge raster images were geo-referenced and
converted into vector polygon geometry. Topology operations
such as sliver polygon removal, overshoot and undershoot error
removal were applied to reﬁne the ﬁeld boundary output. The
accuracy assessment of identiﬁed ﬁeld boundaries was performed
with manually drawn ﬁeld boundaries. Key features such as area
of the polygon and centroid shift were compared between actual
and identiﬁed ﬁeld boundaries. We observed mean of difference
in area of 216 sq. meter and chentroid shift of"
95,Investigating the Performance of Hyperspectral and Simulated Sentinel-2 Data for Soybean Canopy Nitrogen Estimation,"ABSTRACT
Nitrogen (N) is one of the key nutrient element needed for
optimum crop growth and production. Deﬁciency of N leads
to a decrease in crop production and excess results in poor
root growth and leaching into groundwater thereby causing
environmental issues. Hence the optimum application of N
is needed which is possible by exactly estimating the avail-
able quantities of N in the plant. In this study, an attempt has
been made to estimate N in Soybean leaves using the hyper-
spectral and simulated Sentinel-2 observations. Spectral ob-
servations of ﬁfteen soybean leaf samples were collected us-
ing the EKO MS-720 Spectroradiometer. The instrument op-
erates in the spectral range of 350-1050 nm. and collects data
in contiguous 213 bands. Support Vector Regression-based
models were evaluated using three feature selection meth-
ods, 1) individual hyperspectral bands, 2) Normalized band
ratio’s and 3) simulated Sentinel-2 bands and indices. Model
performance was evaluated using R2. Analysis carried out
using the individual hyperspectral bands showed that bands
from the red and red-edge region are performing best with R2
between 0.872 and 0.876. However, NBR’s estimated from
band combinations in the red-edge region are performing best
with R2 between 0.938 – 0.956. Further, we identiﬁed a sub-
set of wavelengths to simulate Sentinel-2 spectral bands, re-
sults showed that red-edge and narrow NIR bands provide the
highest R2 between 0.878 and 0.893. We observed that in-
dices such as Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) and
Chlorophyll Index Red Edge (CIRE) are performing better
for N estimation with R2 of 0.946, 0.923, respectively. Based
on the observations we can conclude that red, red-edge and
narrow NIR region is useful for Soybean N estimation."
95,"Assessing InSAR Coherence for Quantification of Agriculture Area Affected by Rainfall Events in Gujrat, India","ABSTRACT 
In the present study, InSAR coherence products extracted 
from Sentinel-1 were used for the quantification of the 
agricultural region affected by normal to large excess rainfall 
events that occurred in the districts of Gujrat, India in July 
and August 2020. In this analysis, the coherence values 
retrieved during co-event (i.e. during rainfall) were 
comparatively found lower than the pre-event (i.e. before 
rainfall) for all the sub-divisions of the districts. Here, the 
pre-event and co-event coherence histograms were drawn 
and their point of intersection was used to determine an 
optimal threshold value for coherence below which 
agriculture area was considered as affected due to rainfall. 
More than 80 % of the total study area was found affected 
due to rainfall events. The obtained outcomes were cross-
examined with the Landsat-8 images obtained for the study 
duration and the results were found encouraging."
95,Integration of Sentinel 1 and 2 Observations for Mapping Early and Late Sowing of Soybean and Cotton Crop Using Deep Learning,"ABSTRACT
The main objective of this paper is mapping of Soybean and
Cotton crop area using the integration of Sentinel-1 and 2 ob-
servations and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The present re-
search also attempted the identiﬁcation of early and late sow-
ing of Soybean and Cotton using time-series of Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and VH backscatter. The
study was carried out in Wardha district of Maharashtra, India
during Kharif 2019. The Sentinel-1 observations available
during 15 Jun. to 30 Nov. 2019 and Sentinel-2 maximum
NDVI and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) com-
posites during Aug. to Sept. and Oct. to Nov. 2019 were
used for Cotton and Soybean area mapping. We evaluated the
performance of tuned Random Forest (RF) and DNN for clas-
siﬁcation of Soybean and Cotton. Results showed that DNN
performs better with an overall accuracy of 89.15% and the F-
score of 0.856. Further, identiﬁcation of early and late sown
Soybean and Cotton was performed using short time-series
of VH backscatter and NDVI. Local minima along with sub-
sequent increase/decrease based approach was developed for
the separation of early and late sown crop. Visual comparison
with geo-tagged crop growth stage images shows good agree-
ment between estimated and actual sowing time window."
95,"Development of Geospatial Processing Frameworks for Sentinel-1, -2 Satellite Data","ABSTRACT 
To monitor changes in the landscapes at local to regional 
scales, a large amount of multi-temporal remote sensing 
products are required for the analysis. Due to the 
frequent need for remote sensing-based results, research 
as 
well 
as 
commercial 
organizations 
required 
automated, faster and more efficient methods for 
downloading 
and 
subsequently, 
processing 
the 
enormous amount of such remote sensing datasets. In 
this study, we have designed and developed geospatial 
data processing frameworks enriched with automated 
data search, download, and processing of Sentinel-1,-2 
data. The analysis-ready outputs i.e. Normalized 
Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI), 
Normalized 
Difference Water Index (NDWI) and radar backscatter 
(σ°) etc. are essential in operational remote sensing use 
cases such as crop area, crop health, crop loss mapping. 
The overall framework for Sentinel-1,-2 has been 
successfully implemented in the Python programming 
environment."
95,Monitoring and Analysis of Viirs Fire Events Data Over Indian States of Punjab and Haryana,"ABSTRACT
Paddy residue burning is common across Indo-Gagantic plane
i.e. Punjab and Haryana states of India. Rice-Wheat cropping
system is intensively followed across the Punjab and Haryana.
Every year, Rice is cultivated from May to Oct.followed by
the Wheat from Nov. to April. Most of the farmers burn the
leftover plant debris after Rice harvesting and clear the ﬁelds
for the next cropping season. The burning of crop residues re-
leases several particles and gases into the atmosphere which
causes huge air-pollution. There is an urgent need to moni-
tor such man-made burning to avoid/minimize the air-water
pollution. Satellites such as MODIS and VIIRS provide ac-
tive ﬁre events data daily. We have attempted to analyze the
data provided by VIIRS over Punjab and Haryana. This paper
attempts to answer a few research questions such as"
95,INVESTIGATING THE PERFORMANCE OF RANDOM FOREST AND SUPPORT,"ABSTRACT:
The current study focuses on the estimation of cloud-free Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) observations obtained from Sentinel-1 (A and B) sensor. South-West Summer Monsoon over the Indian sub-continent
lasts for four months (mid-June to mid-October). During this time, optical remote sensing observations are affected by dense cloud
cover. Therefore, there is a need for methodology to estimate state of vegetation during the cloud cover. The crops considered in
this study are Paddy (Rice) from Punjab and Haryana, whereas Cotton, Turmeric, and Banana from Andhra Pradesh, India. We have
considered, observations of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors with the same overpass day and non-cloudy pixels for each crop. We used
Google Earth Engine to extract surface reﬂectance for the Sentinel-2 and Ground Range Detected (GRD) backscatter for Sentinel-"

substantial loss to the infrastructure and crops of the region.
Countries across the globe are prone to such natural calamities.
In India, speciﬁcally coastal parts are vulnerable to tropical
cyclones. In 2018 east coast districts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra
Pradesh, India were affected by the three cyclones namely Titli
(11 Oct. 2018), Gaja (16 Nov. 2018) and Pethai (17 Dec. 2018)
causing severe damage to seasonal crops such as Rice, Coconut
and Areca Nut plantations. Traditional survey-based methods of
crop loss assessment are time-consuming and labor-intensive.
This study addresses the problem of near-real-time qualitative
crop loss assessment due to tropical Gaja cyclone using the
temporal data from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites. The crop damage
assessment study has been undertaken for Gaja cyclone in the
affected district of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. The major
crops cultivated in the district are Kharif Rice (locally called as
Samba and Late Samba) and Coconut plantations. The study
addresses qualitative loss assessment in terms of crop area
affected. As a ﬁrst step, we used time series data of Sentinel-"
95,OPERATIONAL NEAR REAL TIME RICE AREA MAPPING USING MULTI-TEMPORAL,"ABSTRACT:
Spatio-temporal crop phenological information helps in understanding trends in food supply, planning of seed/fertilizer inputs, etc. in
a region. Rice is one of the major food sources for many regions of the world especially in monsoon Asia and accounts for more
than 11% of the global cropland. Accurate, on-time and early information on spatial distribution of rice would be useful for stake-
holders (cultivators, fertilizer/pesticide manufacturers and agriculture extension agencies) to effectively plan supply of inputs, market
activities. Also, government agencies can plan and formulate policies regarding food security. Conventional methods involves manual
surveying for developing spatio-temporal crop datasets while remote sensing satellite observations provide cost effective alternatives
with better spatial extent and temporal frequency. Remote sensing is one of the effective technologies to map the areal extent of the
crops using optical as well as microwave/Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) sensors. Cloud cover is the major problem faced in using
the optical datasets during monsoon (June to Sept. locally called Kharif season). Hence, Sentinel-1 C-band (center frequency: 5.405
GHz) RADAR sensor launched by European Space Agency (ESA) which has an Interferometric Wide-swath mode (IW) with dual
polarization (VV and VH) has been used for rice area mapping. Limited studies have attempted to establish operational early season
rice area mapping to facilitate local governance, agri-input management and crop growers. The key contribution of this work is towards
operational near real time and early season rice area mapping using multi-temporal SAR data on GEE platform. The study has been
carried out in four districts viz., Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari and West Godavari from Andhra Pradesh (AP), India during the period
of Kharif 2017. The study region is also called as coastal AP where rice transplanting during the Kharif season is carried out during
mid Jun. till Aug. and harvesting during Oct. to mid Dec. months. The training data for various classes viz, Rice, NonRice-Agriculture,
Waterbodies, Settlements, Forest and Aquaculture have been obtained from GEE, Global Land Cover (GLC) layers developed by ESA
and ﬁeld observations. We have evaluated the performance of Random Forest (RF) classiﬁer by varying the number of trees and in-
crementally adding the SAR images for model training. Initially the model has been trained considering two images available from
mid June 2017. Further, various models have been trained by adding one consecutive image till end of August 2017 and classiﬁcation
performance has been evaluated on validation dataset. The classiﬁed output has been further masked with agriculture non-agriculture
layer derived from global land-cover layer obtained from ESA. Analysis shows that incremental addition of temporal observations
improves the performance of the classiﬁer. The overall classiﬁcation accuracy ranges between 78.11 to 87.00%. We have found that
RF classiﬁer with 30 trees trained on six images available from mid June till end August performed better with classiﬁcation accuracy
of 87.00%. However, accuracy assessment performed using independent stratiﬁed random sampling approach showed the classiﬁcation
accuracy of 84.45%. An attempt is being made to follow the proposed approach for current (i.e. 2018) season and provide incremental
rice area estimates in near real-time."
96,Development of an Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting System Based on a Current Transformer for Use in Industrial Electric Motors,"Abstract—Predictive maintenance systems for industrial elec-
tric motors are being developed using electronic sensors and
wireless communication systems incorporated into ultra-low
consumption electronic circuits. If the electronic circuit is ultra-
low consumption, a simple low-capacity rechargeable battery can
power the system for years. However, the use of batteries on a
large scale contributes to environmental pollution. To eliminate
the use of batteries, several energy harvesting techniques are
being used to make the electronic sensors self-sustaining. In
this sense, this paper presents the development of an electro-
magnetic energy harvesting system based on an off-the-shelf
Current Transformer (CT), with the energy management done
via Integrated Circuit (IC), for use in an Internet of Things
(IoT) vibration monitoring system for industrial electric motors.
A process was carried out to maximize energy generation through
the design of a resonant frequency tuning capacitor, optimization
of the electronic circuit for energy harvesting by adjusting a
shunt resistor, and energy management based on the LTC3108
IC. The resulting energy harvesting system could generate a

96,DOI: 10.53660/CLM -1667 -23I13  ,"ABSTRACT 
This paper improvies the traditional FOTA system to a more robust one named ANFUOTA. This technique 
is only applicable to systems without embedded operating systems and to microcontrollers without multiple 
flash memory bank. This novel system is capable of updating the firmware in an asynchronous mode via 
networks WSN/WSAN kind and furthermore, it guarantees that the system never be without a valid 
firmware or rather, it is immune of communication failure or loss of packets and even feeding loss, 
independently of the updating phase. Even during the memory rewriting, in case it happens a feeding failure, 
the system will begin all over again the recording in the next rebooting. The used technique foresses an 
updating via networks WSN kind in an asynchronous mode and the firmware can be received in a 
distributed way in time and in many pieces or capable of being continuous. During this phase, the system 
remains online and doesn't enter in recording mode, keeping its activity on network. The system guarantees 
immunity in face of feeding loss and loss of packets by the network in all phases of updating, enabling 
updating all devices in network, simultaneously."

96,Advances in Agriculture Robotics: A State-of-the-Art Review and Challenges Ahead,"Abstract: The constant advances in agricultural robotics aim to overcome the challenges imposed
by population growth, accelerated urbanization, high competitiveness of high-quality products,
environmental preservation and a lack of qualiﬁed labor. In this sense, this review paper surveys
the main existing applications of agricultural robotic systems for the execution of land preparation
before planting, sowing, planting, plant treatment, harvesting, yield estimation and phenotyping.
In general, all robots were evaluated according to the following criteria: its locomotion system,
what is the ﬁnal application, if it has sensors, robotic arm and/or computer vision algorithm,
what is its development stage and which country and continent they belong. After evaluating
all similar characteristics, to expose the research trends, common pitfalls and the characteristics
that hinder commercial development, and discover which countries are investing into Research
and Development (R&D) in these technologies for the future, four major areas that need future
research work for enhancing the state of the art in smart agriculture were highlighted: locomotion
systems, sensors, computer vision algorithms and communication technologies. The results of this
research suggest that the investment in agricultural robotic systems allows to achieve short—harvest
monitoring—and long-term objectives—yield estimation."
96,Advances in Forest Robotics: A State-of-the-Art Survey,"Abstract: The development of robotic systems to operate in forest environments is of great relevance
for the public and private sectors. In this sense, this article reviews several scientiﬁc papers, research
projects and commercial products related to robotic applications for environmental preservation,
monitoring, wildﬁre ﬁreﬁghting, inventory operations, planting, pruning and harvesting. After
conducting critical analysis, the main characteristics observed were: (a) the locomotion system is
directly affected by the type of environmental monitoring to be performed; (b) different reasons for
pruning result in different locomotion and cutting systems; (c) each type of forest, in each season and
each type of soil can directly interfere with the navigation technique used; and (d) the integration
of the concept of swarm of robots with robots of different types of locomotion systems (land, air or
sea) can compensate for the time of executing tasks in unstructured environments. Two major areas
are proposed for future research works: Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart forest and navigation
systems. It is expected that, with the various characteristics exposed in this paper, the current robotic
forest systems will be improved, so that forest exploitation becomes more efﬁcient and sustainable."
96,Development of a Smart Traffic Light Control System With Real-Time Monitoring,"Abstract—From its emergence to the present day, trafﬁc light
control systems have been widely used to monitor and control the
ﬂow of vehicles. However, with the increasing number of public
(bus) and private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and truck), urban cen-
ters are becoming more and more populous. Such phenomenon
leads to trafﬁc congestion and increases environmental and noise
pollution. In order to stem the rise of such problems, large cities
are adopting technological solutions, materializing the concept of
smart cities. While observing trafﬁc management systems them-
selves, several hardware and software solutions have been studied
and implemented around the world. This article aims to con-
tribute to trafﬁc signals improvement by developing a centralized
trafﬁc light control system, using a unique wireless communica-
tion network. In order to prove the system’s effectiveness, the
most common types of urban intersections were analyzed. Direct
control routines were implemented for network trafﬁc lights, pro-
viding a complete control system for extraordinary events, such
as closing roads due to accidents or public events. Finally, safety
routines were formulated to report the operating status of the
trafﬁc light system lamps to a central management. With the aid
of a logic analyzer connected to the outputs for each focal group,
it was possible to set up an operating stages timing diagram of
each trafﬁc light. Thus, the system validation was achieved based
on theoretical and practical timing diagrams similarities."

This article focuses on the economic sanctions and the listing process in the light 
of due process of law, as well as the legitimacy of the European Union to impose 
such sanctions under international law. It has a qualitative approach, using the 
methodology of documental analysis (particularly the documents from the Euro-
pean Union Council and Commission) and bibliographical research. Since 2014 
the European Union has imposed restrictive measures against the Russian Feder-
ation in response to the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as ‘destabi-
lization’ of Ukraine.  Due to the imposition of these measures, 159 persons were 
subject to assets freezing and visa bans; 41 entities had their assets frozen in the 
EU; also including economic sanctions such as the limitation of Russian state-
owned financial institutions to the European capital markets; and the access to 
‘sensitive’ technologies, particularly in the energetic and military industries. As a 
conclusion, the listing process has improved considerably in the past years to 
align itself with the principle of due process. Critically, it is indicated the need to 
allow the targets to be heard and present their defense before any measures taken 
and in urgent matters which by its nature demand inaudita alteram parte decisions,

96,"Modeling, Simulation and Implementation of Locomotion Patterns for Hexapod Robots","Abstract—The legged robots can insert themselves in environ-

of be inserted, as is the case of obstacles of large dimensions,
terrain loose or steep slopes [1]–[5]. The objective of this work is
to develop the modeling of hexapods robots and simulate them in
a virtual environment of mechanical systems (according to Fig.
1), which makes possible performance analysis of several model
criteria and determine the virtual path built by the robot [6]. The
present work implemented the robot simulation in the Simulink
simulation environment, using SimMechanics [7]. A computer
program [8] was developed to make changes in the mechanical
structure, in the simulation parameters, to evaluate the stability
of the type of locomotion, the direct visualization of the position,
speed, acceleration, and force applied to each foot of the robot.
With the implementation of the stability determination algorithm,
it was possible to verify that, for different locomotion patterns,
there was an improvement in the stability, starting from the
metachronal wave to tetrapod and tripod gaits, and there was
also a consecutive decrease in the minimum torque required to
the servo motors [9]."

that improve the population living conditions. Most trafﬁc light
controller systems are locally programmed. In this case, to control
all trafﬁc lights in a city, besides to be a slow task, it is not
possible to determine the trafﬁc light’s operating state. In some
cases a centralized control is used, allowing information exchange
with all trafﬁc lights on the network. This paper seeks to study
and develop a trafﬁc light controller electronic circuit, with
centralized control topology, able to communicate with other
wireless network trafﬁc lights. All characteristics of the designed
circuit were evaluated by practical system control and monitoring
tests. Finally, the electronic circuit proved to be viable in terms
of smart cities applications."

97,ReCDA: Concept Drift Adaptation with Representation Enhancement for Network Intrusion Detection,"ABSTRACT
The deployment of learning-based models to detect malicious activ-
ities in network traffic flows is significantly challenged by concept
drift. With evolving attack technology and dynamic attack behav-
iors, the underlying data distribution of recently arrived traffic flows
deviates from historical empirical distributions over time. Existing
approaches depend on a significant amount of labeled drifting sam-
ples to facilitate the deep model to handle concept drift, which faces
labor-intensive manual labeling and the risk of label noise. In this pa-
per, we propose ReCDA, a Concept Drift Adaptation method with
Representation enhancement, which consists of a self-supervised
representation enhancement stage and a weakly-supervised classi-
fier tuning stage. Specifically, in the initial stage, ReCDA introduces
drift-aware perturbation and representation alignment to facilitate
the model in acquiring robust representations from drift-aware and
drift-invariant perspectives. Moreover, in the subsequent stage, a
meticulously crafted instructive sampling strategy and a robust
representation constraint encourage the model to learn discrim-
inative knowledge about benign and malicious activities during
fine-tuning, thereby enhancing performance further. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets under
varying degrees of concept drift. The experiment results demon-
strate the superior adaptability and robustness of the proposed
method.

97,Synergizing Foundation Models and Federated Learning: A Survey,"Abstract
The recent development of Foundation Mod-
els (FMs), represented by large language mod-
els, vision transformers, and multimodal mod-
els, has been making a significant impact on
both academia and industry. Compared with
small-scale models, FMs have a much stronger
demand for high-volume data during the pre-
training phase. Although general FMs can be
pre-trained on data collected from open sources
such as the Internet, domain-specific FMs need
proprietary data, posing a practical challenge
regarding the amount of data available due to
privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is
a collaborative learning paradigm that breaks
the barrier of data availability from different
participants. Therefore, it provides a promis-
ing solution to customize and adapt FMs to
a wide range of domain-specific tasks using
distributed datasets whilst preserving privacy.
This survey paper discusses the potentials and
challenges of synergizing FL and FMs and
summarizes core techniques, future directions,
and applications. A periodically updated paper

97,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS 1,"Abstract—The Internet is booming with information, and it
has become especially difficult for consumers to sift through the
information. Recommendation systems can effectively enhance
the consumer experience. However, model-based recommendation
systems require sufficient training data, so they perform poorly
in small-scale recommendation scenarios such as graduate school
recommendation. To this end, we focus on online recommendation
in graduate school application scenarios. We propose a Pre-
purify Temporal-decay Memory-based Collaborative Filtering
model called PTMCF, which firstly improves the data quality
based on the users’ background information by pre-purifying
the data to compensate for the poor performance caused by
the small dataset. At the same time, considering that user
preferences and the importance of information are constantly
changing, we propose incorporating Newton’s Law of Cooling
when constructing the user-item scoring matrix to assign time-
based weights. Experiments on a dataset collected from real-
world questionnaires show that pre-purify and temporal-decay
effectively improve recommendation quality and mitigate the
impact of data sparsity on memory-based collaborative filtering."
97,FourierKAN-GCF: Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network - An Effective and Efficient Feature Transformation for Graph Collaborative Filtering,"ABSTRACT
Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) has achieved state-of-the-art
performance for recommendation tasks. However, most GCF struc-
tures simplify the feature transformation and nonlinear operation
during message passing in the graph convolution network (GCN).
We revisit these two components and discover that a part of fea-
ture transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing
in GCN can improve the representation of GCF, but increase the
difficulty of training.
In this work, we propose a simple and effective graph-based
recommendation model called FourierKAN-GCF. Specifically, it
utilizes a novel Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to
replace the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a part of the feature
transformation during message passing in GCN, which improves the
representation power of GCF and is easy to train. We further employ
message dropout and node dropout strategies to improve the repre-
sentation power and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FourierKAN-
GCF over most state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
is available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/FKAN-GCF.

97,Blades: A Unified Benchmark Suite for Byzantine Attacks and Defenses in Federated Learning,"Abstract—Federated learning (FL) facilitates distributed train-
ing across different IoT and edge devices, safeguarding the privacy
of their data. The inherent distributed structure of FL introduces
vulnerabilities, especially from adversarial devices aiming to
skew local updates to their advantage. Despite the plethora
of research focusing on Byzantine-resilient FL, the academic
community has yet to establish a comprehensive benchmark suite,
pivotal for impartial assessment and comparison of different
techniques. This paper presents Blades, a scalable, extensible, and
easily conﬁgurable benchmark suite that supports researchers
and developers in efﬁciently implementing and validating novel
strategies against baseline algorithms in Byzantine-resilient FL.
Blades contains built-in implementations of representative attack
and defense strategies and offers a user-friendly interface that
seamlessly integrates new ideas. Using Blades, we re-evaluate
representative attacks and defenses on wide-ranging experimental
conﬁgurations (approximately 1,500 trials in total). Through our
extensive experiments, we gained new insights into FL robustness
and highlighted previously overlooked limitations due to the
absence of thorough evaluations and comparisons of baselines
under various attack settings. We maintain the source code and

97,HALO: HVAC Load Forecasting With Industrial IoT and Local&#x2013;Global-Scale Transformer,"Abstract—The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) is fostering
the use of intelligent controls for energy conservation. Yet,
the efﬁcacy of these strategies is largely tied to diverse load
forecasting algorithms. Given the signiﬁcant contribution of
heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to
global energy consumption, accurate forecasting of HVAC power
usage is crucial for improving overall energy efﬁciency. However,
real-world HVAC load forecasting, bolstered by various IoT
devices, is complicated by multiple factors: data variability,
power load ﬂuctuations, electronic phenomena (e.g., zero drifts),
and the increased time complexity and larger model sizes
required to manage accumulating historical data. To address
these challenges, we ﬁrst present an in-depth measurement
study on the characteristics of HVAC load at a minute scale
based on the HVAC data collected in six locations. We propose
HALO, a transformer-based framework speciﬁcally designed for
forecasting HVAC load. HALO incorporates an adaptive data
preprocessing stage and a local–global-scale transformer-based
load forecasting stage, enabling precise forecasting of HVAC load
and optimization of energy utilization. Evaluation based on real-
world data traces from a prototype application demonstrates
that the proposed framework signiﬁcantly outperforms existing
models."
97,Hyperdimensional Computing With Multiscale Local Binary Patterns for Scalp EEG-Based Epileptic Seizure Detection,"Abstract—Epilepsy is a common condition that causes frequent
seizures, signiﬁcantly impacting patients’ daily lives. Noninvasive
electroencephalogram (EEG) is an effective tool for detecting
seizure onset. Wearable EEG devices enable real-time monitoring
and timely intervention but pose new algorithmic challenges on
small model weight sizes and limited training data. Brain-inspired
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) presents a potential solution
for its small weight size and quick learning ability. Combining
local binary pattern (LBP) codes with HDC can capture dynamic
features in EEG time series. However, traditional LBP features
may not offer sufﬁcient robustness for trend modeling due to
their high localization on individual samples, particularly on
low-amplitude and nonstationary scalp EEG signals. To address
the above challenges, this article proposes a multiscale LBP-
based HDC (MSLBP-HDC) approach for scalp EEG analysis.
Unlike traditional LBP-based HDC focusing only on the local
change trend, the designed MSLBP-HDC extracts dynamic
features at different time resolutions to detect abnormal cortical
oscillations. The lengths of multiple temporal scales in MSLBP-
HDC are determined based on the duration of spikes. Our results
demonstrate that MSLBP-HDC has the highest speciﬁcity for
all test seizure types and achieves competitive macroaveraging
accuracy with the smallest model weight size in detection,
compared to advanced deep learning, support vector machine,
and HDC methods. Regarding few-shot learning performance,
MSLBP-HDC outperforms existing approaches and achieves high
accuracy using only 1% of the training data. Moreover, feature
interpretability analysis from space and time domains highlights
that MSLBP-HDC successfully extracts seizure-relevant features
rather than noise or artifacts, ensuring the algorithm’s reliability."

guage input, struggling to understand sentences with the same semantic

ical question: Can 3D vision-language models truly understand
natural language? To test the language understandability of 3D-VL

formance when presented with different language style variants. Impor-
tantly, these variants are commonly encountered in applications requir-
ing direct interaction with humans, such as embodied robotics, given
the diversity and unpredictability of human language. We propose a 3D
Language Robustness Dataset, designed based on the characteristics of
human language, to facilitate the systematic study of robustness. Our
comprehensive evaluation uncovers a significant drop in the performance
of all existing models across various 3D-VL tasks. Even the state-of-the-
art 3D-LLM fails to understand some variants of the same sentences.
Further in-depth analysis suggests that the existing models have a frag-
ile and biased fusion module, which stems from the low diversity of the
existing dataset. Finally, we propose a training-free module driven by
LLM, which improves language robustness. Datasets and code will be
available at github: https://github.com/VincentDENGP/3D-LR."
97,MENTOR: Multi-level Self-supervised Learning for Multimodal Recommendation,"ABSTRACT
With the increasing multimedia information, multimodal recom-
mendation has received extensive attention. It utilizes multimodal
information to alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommenda-
tion systems, thus improving recommendation accuracy. However,
the reliance on labeled data severely limits the performance of mul-
timodal recommendation models. Recently, self-supervised learning
has been used in multimodal recommendations to mitigate the label
sparsity problem. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods cannot
avoid the modality noise when aligning multimodal information due
to the large differences in the distributions of different modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multi-level sElf-supervised learNing for
mulTimOdal Recommendation (MENTOR) method to address the
label sparsity problem and the modality alignment problem. Specifi-
cally, MENTOR first enhances the specific features of each modality
using the graph convolutional network (GCN) and fuses the visual
and textual modalities. It then enhances the item representation
via the item semantic graph for all modalities, including the fused
modality. Then, it introduces two multilevel self-supervised tasks:
the multilevel cross-modal alignment task and the general feature
enhancement task. The multilevel cross-modal alignment task aligns
each modality under the guidance of the ID embedding from multi-
ple levels while maintaining the historical interaction information.
The general feature enhancement task enhances the general feature
from both the graph and feature perspectives to improve the robust-
ness of our model. Extensive experiments on three publicly available
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/MENTOR.

Internet of Things (IoT) is generating a massive amount of data.
This has the potential to revolutionise fields like healthcare, en-
vironmental management, and city planning. However, to unlock
this potential, we need machine learning (ML) to transform raw
sensor data into actionable insights. Machine learning offers
a powerful way to turn sensor data into something we can
understand and use. However, several challenges stand in the
way of bringing these ideas to life: (1) Limited Resources: Devices
often have limited computing power, memory, and battery life.
(2) Complex Systems: Building ML models for sensor systems
can be intricate. (3) Real-World Testing: Designing effective
studies and collecting reliable data (ground truth) can be difficult.

97,FACC: A Flexible and Asynchronous Updating Strategy for Cooperative Edge Caching,"ABSTRACT
Recently, cooperative edge caching effectively reduces redundant
transmissions and user plane latency by deploying potentially re-
quested videos in edge nodes. Many existing works focused on
designing accurate and diverse video selection strategies. However,
they ignored that the edge nodes’ heterogeneous requirements of
replacement timings also impact the caching performance. In this
paper, we propose FACC, a cooperative caching framework in which
each edge node can flexibly select variable replacement timings
and asynchronously update cached videos. We formulate the asyn-
chronous cache replacement problem as an integer programming
problem with a semi-Markov property. To solve this problem, we
propose HiMAPPO, a multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement
learning algorithm. It has been validated that FACC can effectively
improve the edge hit rate and significantly reduce replacement
costs compared with existing approaches on a real-world dataset.

97,A Coverage-Aware Task Allocation Method for UAV-Assisted Mobile Crowd Sensing,"Abstract—Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is an emerging
paradigm that engages participants collaboratively in completing
sensing tasks. The mobility and intelligence of mobile devices offer
an efﬁcient solution for large-scale sensing applications, such as
in smart cities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), considered as
mobile devices, can be integrated into MCS to collaborate with
human participants in order to meet the task sensing coverage
requirement. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-assisted task allo-
cation method (U-TAM) that allocates tasks to human participants
and UAVs concurrently. Distinct from existing methods, U-TAM
prioritizes minimizing the privacy leakage of human participants
while maximizing sensed coverage. To achieve this, it initially
predicts their trajectories using a deep reinforcement learning
approach, relying solely on the information provided by their start
and destination locations. In addition to the predicted trajectories,
the proposed U-TAM allocates tasks to human participants based
on their tolerance levels and limited budget. This approach aligns
with the Pareto optimal theory, seeking to balance the trade-off
among participants’ tolerance level, limited budget, and the re-
quirement for task sensing coverage. In the meantime, the UAVs
sense data efﬁciently from areas that are not sensed by human
participants or other UAVs. To this end, we propose a multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning framework for multi-UAV trajectory
planning, which integrates the greedy method into deep Q-learning.
We evaluate the proposed method using simulation and a small-

their physical and mental health status has been extensively studied across various research domains, such as public health, medicine,
and data science. Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children’s health and aid in the development
of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context
data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges
have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and
learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal
features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design
requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains
(e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers
in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children’s health status from multi-level perspectives.
Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature

97,On Quotients of Stochastic Networks Over Finite Fields,"Abstract—This article studies the set stability of stochas-
tic ﬁnite-ﬁeld networks (SFFNs) via the quotient-transition-
system (QTS)-based method. The QTS is constructed to
preserve the complete probabilistic transition information
of the original SFFN and has a comparatively smaller net-
work scale. First, with respect to the initial partition of
the state set, we obtain the smallest QTS by calculating
the coarsest equivalence relation. Then, the stability rela-
tionship between SFFN and its corresponding QTS is ex-
plored. In particular, the smallest QTS corresponding to
a synchronous n-node SFFN has no greater than n + 1
nodes. This formal simplicity gives a solid foundation for
the subsequent research. Moreover, we establish a visu-
alization interface “quotient generator” to obtain the quo-
tients for any SFFN. After that, we explore the necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions for the set stability in distribution
and the ﬁnite-time set stability with probability one of the
SFFNs based on the QTS. Finally, an example concerning a
27-state SFFN is presented to demonstrate the theoretical
results, indicating that its synchronization analysis can be
completely characterized by the stability of a 4-node QTS.
Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among the num-
ber of iterations to obtain the smallest QTS, the number of
nodes in the obtained QTS, and the types of SFFNs."

Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system heterogeneity

methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can
extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our
study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings
and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client
performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in
contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradient distributions indicate
the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo
Aggregation that leverages internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients
from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity
in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients.
Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous
FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand
their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results
validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer
gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogeneous FL.

98,A novel approach to identify problematic call center conversations,"Abstract—Voice based call centers enable customers to query
for information by speaking to agents in the call center. Most
often these call conversations are recorded for analysis with the
intent of trying to identify things that can help improve the
performance of the call center to serve the customer better.
Today the recorded conversations are analyzed by humans by
listening to call conversations, which is both time consuming,
fatigue prone and not accurate. Additionally, humans are able
to analyze only a small percentage of the total calls because of
economics. In this paper, we propose a visual method to identify
problem calls quickly. The idea is to sieve through all the calls and
identify problem calls, these calls can then be further analyzed
by human. We ﬁrst model call conversations as a directed graph
and then identify a structure associated with a normal call. All
call conversations that do not have the structure of a normal call
are then classiﬁed as being abnormal. In this paper, we use the
speaking rate feature to model call conversation because it makes
it easy to spot potential problem calls. We have experimented on
real call center conversations acquired from a call center and the
results are encouraging."

mathematical framework to determine the angular velocity of the rotors, the total current consumed by the rotors and the
hovering power consumption of the UAV, wherein the UAV hovers at the optimal height depending upon the NOMA or OMA
data transmission scheme. We propose a graphical methodology to compute the battery life of the UAV. The simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method of UAV-assisted NOMA and OMA data transmission coupled with the wide elliptical
beam signiﬁcantly reduces the communication power requirements to meet the desired QoS requirements of the ground users as
compared to the conventional UAV-assisted NOMA and OMA transmission schemes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology
considerably enhances the battery life of the UAV, thereby resulting in a greater hovering time of the UAV compared to the
conventional UAV-assisted NOMA and OMA transmission schemes.

the users. Thereafter, we investigate a framework to design a
wide elliptical beam to serve the users under the coverage of the
UAV. Next, in this paper, we present an exhaustive mathematical
framework to determine the angular velocity of the rotors, the
total current consumed by the rotors and the hovering power
consumption of the UAV, wherein the UAV hovers at the optimal
height depending upon the NOMA or OMA data transmission
scheme. We propose a graphical methodology to compute the
battery life of the UAV. The simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed method of UAV-assisted NOMA and OMA data
transmission coupled with the wide elliptical beam significantly
reduces the communication power requirements to meet the
desired QoS requirements of the ground users as compared to
the conventional UAV-assisted NOMA and OMA transmission
schemes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology considerably
enhances the battery life of the UAV, thereby resulting in a greater
hovering time of the UAV compared to the conventional UAV-
assisted NOMA and OMA transmission schemes."
99,Traffic-Aware Optimal Multi-Beam Resource Allocation in 5G Networks Impaired by Rain and Foliage,"Abstract— In this letter, we study a traffic-aware multi-beam
optimal resource allocation strategy for fixed home users who
are serviced through the utilization of simultaneous multiple
beams generated by next-generation node B (gNB). The strategy
takes into account the effects of rain and foliage attenuation.
We propose a graphical methodology that is combined with a
closed-form expression to compute the optimal coverage radius of
gNB. Afterwards, the k-means clustering algorithm is utilized to
determine an optimal location for the gNB. In this study, we also
present an approach that employs non-linear programming
(NLP) to allocate power and bandwidth among individual beams,
with an objective of satisfying the traffic requirements of each
user. From the results, it is evident that our proposed approach
exhibits superior performance in scenarios characterized by rain
and foliage attenuation, in comparison to alternatives relying on
genetic algorithms and surrogate optimization. approaches."
99,Cluster Based Concurrent Data Collection with Fault Tolerance for Shared IoT Applications,"Abstract—Sharing IoT device infrastructure by multiple enti-
ties or applications for their respective sensing and monitoring
needs is an effective way to reduce the upfront setup cost,
ownership costs, and also to prevent over provisioning. Con-
current data collection in such a shared environment is a major
challenge, given the number of devices and multiple processes
relying on that data. Most of the existing works in this direction
typically consider network scenarios where devices can reach
the base station(s) directly. As this assumption is not always
valid, few other works focused on concurrent data collection
over multiple-hops. In such a shared multi-hop environment,
the chances of device failures are high, especially considering the
power constraints of devices. To address the issue of reliability in
data collection, this paper presents a cluster-based fault tolerant
network structure for concurrent data collection. The proposed
work aims to minimize the delay and handles the topology
changes in case of faults, and also lowers the transmission count.
The validity of the proposed work is shown via analytical and
simulation results."
99,A Novel Technique to Parameterize Congestion Control in 6TiSCH IIoT Networks,"Abstract—The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to
the use of interconnected smart devices, sensors, and other
technologies to create a network of intelligent systems that can
monitor and manage industrial processes. 6TiSCH (IPv6 over
the Time Slotted Channel Hopping mode of IEEE 802.15.4e)
as an enabling technology facilitates low-power and low-latency
communication between IoT devices in industrial environments.
The Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy networks (RPL),
which is used as the de-facto routing protocol for 6TiSCH
networks is observed to suffer from several limitations, es-
pecially during congestion in the network. Therefore, there
is an immediate need for some modifications to the RPL to
deal with this problem. Under traffic load which keeps on
changing continuously at different instants of time, the proposed
mechanism aims at finding the appropriate parent for a node
that can forward the packet to the destination through the
least congested path with minimal packet loss. This facilitates
congestion management under dynamic traffic loads. For this,
a new metric for routing using the concept of exponential
weighting has been proposed, which takes the number of packets
present in the queue of the node into account when choosing
the parent at a particular instance of time. Additionally, the
paper proposes a parent selection and swapping mechanism
for congested networks. Performance evaluations are carried
out in order to validate the proposed work. The results show
an improvement in the performance of RPL under heavy and
dynamic traffic loads."
99,ARCE: Adaptive Real-time Convergence Estimation for Wireless Networks Time Synchronization,"Abstract—Real-time convergence-estimation for time synchro-
nization of wireless sensor networks remains unexplored by
researchers. This work proposes a novel real-time convergence
estimation using an adaptive real-time convergence estimation
(ARCE) algorithm. The algorithm is based on synchronization
error and distribution of both synchronous and asynchronous
time synchronization algorithms. The actual distributions of syn-
chronization error are analyzed and evaluated using signiﬁcant
amount of experimental results. According to the experimental
results and simulations, the ARCE can effectively detect the
convergence state for all the comparisons. Therefore, the ARCE
can be used to develop an adaptive time synchronization protocol
based on synchronization error distribution, which could be
robust and scalable for a large-scale and random-deployed
wireless networks."

Abstract—Internet of Things (IoT) with edge computation

tomation system. However, there is a continued effort to increase
the reliability of the system with minimal downtime. This can
be achieved through a modular, re-conﬁgurable, and integrable

sensor/actuator network and applications. The lowermost layer
allows to reconﬁgure the communication related parameters and
the middle layer consists of a Software-Deﬁned Network (SDN)

by considering the optimal conﬁguration parameters among
the layers. As a top-layer, a priority forwarding mechanism is
designed for SDN core communication in case the sensor and

of services is necessary. This article proposes a programmable

99,Parameter-Sharing-Based Average-Consensus Time Synchronization in IoT Networks,"Abstract—Average-consensus protocol is one of the ways to
develop distributed time-synchronization algorithms in Internet
of Things (IoT) networks. However, the large number of iteration
leads to a common time notion issue in nodes. This poses a
critical challenge in the convergence of the time-synchronization
algorithm and resulting asymptotic convergence in the average
consensus protocol. In this article, a parameter-sharing-based
average-consensus time-synchronization (PACTS) algorithm is
proposed. For fast convergence, the proposed PACTS quickly
forwards the time information to multihop nodes and employs
multihop average-consensus instead of single-hop average con-
sensus. Speciﬁcally, a node asynchronously and periodically
broadcasts the relative clock offset estimation of neighbors with
its local time information. Meanwhile, the relative clock off-
set estimation of the multihop node is calculated and used to
estimate the average value. Consequently, an average consensus
among local multihop nodes is obtained. As a result, the iteration
number and convergence time are signiﬁcantly reduced over
the network. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the
proposed PACTS algorithm has low complexity, high accuracy,
and quick convergence."
99,RIS-assisted Task Offloading for Wireless Dead Zone to Minimize Delay in Edge Computing,"Abstract—End-users under poor wireless network coverage
generally suffer from underutilization of bandwidth. This ad-
versely affects the overall performance of task offloading to the
edge server. In this work, we study a Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS)-assisted wireless network that enables end-user’s
devices under weak signal reception areas to enhance their
offloading opportunities for delay minimization. It becomes a
challenging task to allocate uploading bandwidth allocation
for the offloaded tasks from end-user devices under different
signal coverage areas. We formulate the optimization problem
of bandwidth allocation for the offloaded tasks in the edge
server and the offloading decisions as a quadratically constrained
quadratic problem. We exploit a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)
method to solve the problem. Moreover, during optimization,
we minimize the adverse impact of bandwidth allocation for
poor end-users on good end-users performance. From extensive
simulation results, we show remarkably elevated improvement in
delay reduction with RIS assistance compared to other baselines,
increasing the number and ratio of end-user devices under good
and poor signal reception areas.

99,Mobility-aware Task Offloading in Fog-Assisted Networks,"Abstract—In a fog-computing assisted Internet of Things
network, end-devices typically ofﬂoad computation and storage-
intensive tasks to fog devices. It is primarily done to meet
the latency requirements of tasks, and QoS requirements of
the network. In addition to providing localized computing and
storage services, the fog network also needs to support end-device
mobility while handling ofﬂoaded tasks, especially, to mimic the
ubiquitous availability of the cloud. Most of the existing works
in this direction either recommend task migration or ofﬂoading
tasks by predicting the device’s location. Both these approaches
are shown to have their respective limitations, and, thus a
mobility-aware task ofﬂoading scheme is crucial to meet end-
device task requirements. In this paper, we present an approach
to handle the mobility of end-devices for effectively handling
ofﬂoaded tasks. The proposed mechanism is simple, effective, and
is not constrained by a device’s location, thereby lowering the
costs associated with mobility. Especially, the proposed scheme
entirely eliminates the cost induced during migration, since
effective task ofﬂoading can lessen the necessity to attempt task
migrations. The simulation result of the proposed scheme reduces
execution latency by 44%, saves upto 68% of network usage and
62% of computational cost at the cloud compared to the state-
of-the-art."

studies a tight synchronization between human and robot hands
to establish near to real-time maneuvering. We leverage the com-
puting resources of the participating units of the master domain
to determine the useful data by overserving and predicting the
immediate reaction of the human hand movement. Moreover,
we consider the unreliable wireless channels that lead to packet
error during data transmission from the master domain to the
controlled domain. In particular, by bringing the concept of
edge computing while utilizing the Raspberry Pis’s available yet
limited computing resources, we aim to determine the balance be-
tween useful data and redundant packets without any signiﬁcant
performance degradation. Finally, we implement the proposed
synchronization method of human-robot arm interactions in a
real testbed and compare the performance with baselines.

100,An Adaptive Symmetrical Load Balancing Scheme for Next Generation Wireless Networks,"Abstract: In dense Wi-Fi networks, achieving load balancing is critical to optimize network utilization
and provide equitable network consumption among the users. Traditional Wi-Fi networks have
issues in attaining effective load balancing. Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN) has presented a
viable solution by isolating the data plane and control plane, enabling more agile and cost-effective
networks. In this paper we put forward an Adaptive Symmetrical Load Balancing (ASLB) scheme
to ensure fairness of load symmetry in Software Deﬁned Wi-Fi Networks (SD-Wi-Fi), while also
optimizing the ﬂows transition process using an Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP). User activity
is monitored by access points (APs), which operate under OpenFlow standards. Three essential
features, packet volume, packet category and delay hindrance, are used for ﬂow assignment to various
controllers. The controllers are arranged in two tiers, universal and regional controllers. The universal
controller (UC) handles the workload statistics of regional controllers (RC) in the form of clusters.
Extensive simulations using OMNeT++ simulator are performed. The performance parameters taken
into consideration are throughput, delay, packet loss rate, network transition count and workload
distribution. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the ASLB technique effectively optimizes the network
utilization and ensures equitable network consumption among the end users. The proposed scheme
outperforms the Mean Probe Delay scheme (MPD), Channel Measurement-based Access Selection
scheme (CMAS), Received Signal Strength Indicator-based scheme (RSSI) and Distributed Antenna
Selection scheme (DASA), being 40% higher in throughput and 25% lower in delay."
100,Design and Analysis of Fractal-Shaped High-Impedance Surface Unit Cell Characteristics,"Abstract: Fractal geometries consistently provide solutions to several electromagnetic design prob-
lems. In this paper, fractal geometries such as Hilbert and Moore curves are used to design efﬁcient
High-Impedance Surfaces. Modern communication devices have many sensors that are needed to
communicate wirelessly. The critical component of wireless communications is antennas. Planar
microstrip patch antennas are popular due to their low proﬁle, compactness, and good radiation
characteristics. The structural disadvantages of microstrip antennas are that they have surface waves
that propagate over the ground plane. High-Impedance Surface (HIS) planes are a prominent solution
to minimize and eliminate surface waves. The HIS structures behave as active LC ﬁlters that suppress
surface waves at their resonance frequency. The resonance frequency of the structure is obtained by
its LC equivalent or by analyzing the reﬂection phase characteristics. This work presents conventional
HIS structures similar to mushroom HIS and fractal HIS such as Hilbert curve and Moore curve
HIS. The HIS reﬂection phase characteristics are obtained by applying periodic boundary conditions
with plane wave illumination. The results were obtained in terms of the reﬂection phase angle.
The conventional mushroom structures show narrow band characteristics at given dimensions of
10 mm × 10 mm and 20 mm × 20 mm. These structures are helpful in the replacement of PEC ground
planes for patch antennas under sub-6 GHz. The Hilbert and Moore fractals are also designed and
have a multiband response that can be useful for L, S, and C band applications. Another design
challenge of HIS is protrusions, which make design difﬁcult. The work also presents the effect of
having vias and the absence of vias on reﬂection phase characteristics. The response shows the least
and no signiﬁcant effect of vias under the x-band operation."
100,A Compact Circular Rectenna for RF-Energy Harvesting at ISM Band,"Abstract: With low-power gadgets proliferating, the development of a small, effective rectenna is
crucial for wirelessly energizing devices. A simple circular patch with a partial ground plane for
RF-energy harvesting at ISM (2.45 GHz) band is proposed in this work. The simulated antenna
resonates at 2.45 GHz with an input impedance of 50 Ωand a gain of 2.38 dBi. An L-section matching
a circuit with a voltage doubler is proposed to provide excellent RF-to-DC transformation efﬁciency
at low power input. The proposed rectenna is fabricated and the results show that the return loss
and realized gain have good characteristics at the ISM band with 52% of RF-to-DC transformation
efﬁciency, with an input of 0 dBm power. The projected rectenna is apt for power-up low sensor
nodes in wireless sensor applications."
100,TiWA: Achieving Tetra Indicator Wi-Fi Associations in Software Defined Wi-Fi Networks,"ABSTRACT With the rise in smart devices, challenges such as traffic management particularly in the
indoor scenarios have also increased. Wireless technologies seek to address these needs by using new radio
access technologies that offer faster connectivity and access to the Internet. While 4G and 5G provide
faster connectivity outdoor, Wi-Fi still remains the dominant technology in indoor scenarios due to its low
cost and easy deployment. However, the IEEE 802.11 standard does not address the fairness of load in
user-access point (AP) associations, resulting in unequal user distributions and subpar resource utilization.
Densification has been employed in the past to address the aforementioned issue, but it is costly as it requires
more hardware. Load balancing is necessary in high-density Wi-Fi networks in order to guarantee quality
of service (QoS). To avoid the densification and issues related to load balancing at the APs this paper
introduces tetra indicator Wi-Fi associations (TiWA), a combined SDN-based user association and channel
assignment solution for Wi-Fi networks. TiWA considers multi-criteria to make better association decisions.
The wireless stations from an overloaded OpenFlow enabled AP (OAP) are handed to an underloaded
OAP by considering multi-metrics such as the packet loss rate, received signal strength indicator (RSSI),
throughput and channel occupancy. Extensive experimentations on 5G EmPOWER platform show that
TiWA surpasses previous research methods based on load balancing in terms of aggregated throughput
by 39%, offering superior level of load fairness and supporting greater numbers of users and traffic prior to
hitting the point at which densification is required."
100,Joint Power Control and Phase Shift Design for Future PD-NOMA IRS-Assisted Drone Communications under Imperfect SIC Decoding,"Abstract: Intelligent reﬂecting surfaces (IRS) and power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-
NOMA) have recently gained signiﬁcant attention for enhancing the performance of next-generation
wireless communications networks. More speciﬁcally, IRS can smartly reconﬁgure the incident signal
of the source towards the destination node, extending the wireless coverage and improving the
channel capacity without consuming additional energy. On the other side, PD-NOMA can enhance
the number of devices in the network without using extra spectrum resources. This paper proposes
a new optimization framework for IRS-enhanced NOMA communications where multiple drones
transmit data to the ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices under successive interference cancellation
errors. In particular, the power budget of each drone, PD-NOMA power allocation of IoT devices,
and the phase shift matrix of IRS are simultaneously optimized to enhance the total spectral efﬁciency
of the system. Given the system model and optimization setup, the formulated problem is coupled
with three variables, making it very complex and non-convex. Thus, this work ﬁrst transforms
and decouples the problem into subproblems and then obtains the efﬁcient solution in two steps.
In the ﬁrst step, the closed-form solutions for the power budget and PD-NOMA power allocation
subproblem at each drone are obtained through Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the
second step, the subproblem of efﬁcient phase shift design for each IRS is solved using successive
convex approximation and DC programming. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the
proposed optimization scheme in comparison to the benchmark schemes."
100,New Method to Implement and Analysis of Medical System in Real Time,"Abstract: The use of information technology and technological medical devices has contributed
signiﬁcantly to the transformation of healthcare. Despite that, many problems have arisen in diagnos-
ing or predicting diseases, either as a result of human errors or lack of accuracy of measurements.
Therefore, this paper aims to provide an integrated health monitoring system to measure vital pa-
rameters and diagnose or predict disease. Through this work, the percentage of various gases in the
blood through breathing is determined, vital parameters are measured and their effect on feelings is
analyzed. A supervised learning model is conﬁgured to predict and diagnose based on biometric
measurements. All results were compared with the results of the Omron device as a reference device.
The results proved that the proposed design overcame many problems as it contributed to expanding
the database of vital parameters and providing analysis on the effect of emotions on vital indicators.
The accuracy of the measurements also reached 98.8% and the accuracy of diagnosing COVID-19 was
64%. The work also presents a user interface model for clinicians as well as for smartphones using
the Internet of things."
100,A Multi-Objective Optimization of Secure PullManufacturing Systems,"Abstract: This paper aims to optimize the losses of the current manufacturing systems to perform the
Just in Time (JIT) system and minimize the time, labor, and material in the manufacturing process.
Pull systems, which have a famous name of the Smart Kanban system, are one of the methodologies
to implement the JIT system. The setting of manufacturing system frameworks offers intriguing
capabilities to improve the performance of pull-controlled creation frameworks. Smart Kanban can
be utilized, rather than actual cards, and the data conversion about the manufacturing settings, is
accessible through sensors. Since a Just-in-Time system does not include a buffer, any interruption to
the system can cause the process to stop quite quickly, so security is necessary for the JIT improvement.
However, those systems have recently been unguarded to security threats as they introduce general-
purpose technologies. From the viewpoint of the system, a security measure is implemented for pull
system methods to check for potential threats and analyze vulnerabilities of the pull system. The
Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is used as a novel multiobjective technique to optimize different
types of cost and time. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has robust security
efﬁciency, as well as reduces cost and time consumption."

100,Correcting Errors in Color Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Fault Tolerance Technique,"Abstract: Security standards have been raised through modern multimedia communications technol-

gies are concerned with fault tolerance technique and information security. As a primary method,
there is widespread use of image encryption to protect image information security. Over the past few
years, image encryption has paid more attention to combining DNA technologies in order to increase
security. The objective here is to provide a new method for correcting color image encryption errors
due to the uncertainty of DNA computing by using the fractional order hyperchaotic Lorenz system.
To increase randomness, the proposed cryptosystem is applied to the three plain image channels: Red,
Green, and Blue. Several methods were compared including the following: entropy, correlation, key
sensitivity, key space, data loss attacks, speed computation, Number of Pixel changing rate (NPCR),
and Uniﬁed Average Change Intensity randomness (UACI) tests. Consequently, the proposed scheme
is very secure against a variety of cryptographic attacks."

100,Non-Linear Hopped Chaos Parameters-Based Image Encryption Algorithm Using Histogram Equalization,"Abstract: Multimedia wireless communications have rapidly developed over the years. Accordingly,
an increasing demand for more secured media transmission is required to protect multimedia
contents. Image encryption schemes have been proposed over the years, but the most secure and
reliable schemes are those based on chaotic maps, due to the intrinsic features in such kinds of
multimedia contents regarding the pixels’ high correlation and data handling capabilities. The novel
proposed encryption algorithm introduced in this article is based on a 3D hopping chaotic map
instead of ﬁxed chaotic logistic maps. The non-linearity behavior of the proposed algorithm, in
terms of both position permutation and value transformation, results in a more secured encryption
algorithm due to its non-convergence, non-periodicity, and sensitivity to the applied initial conditions.
Several statistical and analytical tests such as entropy, correlation, key sensitivity, key space, peak
signal-to-noise ratio, noise attacks, number of pixels changing rate (NPCR), uniﬁed average change
intensity randomness (UACI), and others tests were applied to measure the strength of the proposed
encryption scheme. The obtained results prove that the proposed scheme is very robust against
different cryptography attacks compared to similar encryption schemes."

exceptional space compliance, unique information, and processing capability of real mitochondrial
deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA). In this article, color image encryption employs a confusion process
based on a hybrid chaotic map, ﬁrst to split each channel of color images into n-clusters; then to
create global shuﬄing over the whole image; and ﬁnally, to apply intrapixel shuﬄing in each cluster,
which results in very disordered pixels in the encrypted image. Then, it utilizes the rationale of
human mitochondrial genome mtDNA to diﬀuse the previously confused pixel values. Hypothetical

document. When the original signer is not in his office or when he/she travels outside, he/she delegates his 
signing capability to a proxy signer and then the proxy signer generates a signing message on behalf of the 
original signer.During the transmission of data between the sender and receiver, errors may occur frequently. 
Therefore, the sender must re-transmit the data to the receiver in order to correct these errors, which makes the 
system very feeble. The techniques of proxy signature and fault tolerance are two important issues in modern 
communication.To communicate securelyover an unreliable public network, the two parties must be able to 
authenticate one another and agree on a secret encryption key. Authenticated key agreement protocols have an 
important role in building a secure communications network between the two parties. In this paper, we propose 
a secure proxy signature scheme with fault tolerance over an efficient and secure authenticated key agreement 
protocol based on factoring and the discrete logarithm problem."

Proxy signature scheme permits an original signer to delegate his/her signing capability to a 
proxy signer and then the proxy signer generates a signing message on behalf of the original 
signer. So far, the proxy signature scheme is only applied in a special duration, when the 
original signer is not in his office or when he travels outside.  The two parties must be able to 
authenticate one another and agree on a secret encryption key, in order to communicate 
securely over an unreliable public network. Authenticated key agreement protocols have an 
important role in building a secure communications network between the two parties. In this 
paper, we propose a secure proxy signature scheme over an efficient and secure authenticated 
key agreement protocol based on RSA cryptosystem."

mitigation and power factor improvement of an induction heating (IH) system. The latter employs
a high-frequency resonant inverter that is responsible for the generation of high-frequency harmonics,
which, in turn, deteriorates the power quality. This mitigation must be done in accordance with
harmonic regulations such as IEEE Std. 519-2014,IEC-555, and EN 61000-3-2, etc. Consequently,
an MVR is placed between the power supply and the IH system. The proposed novel MVR topology
overcomes the limitations of conventional Vienna rectiﬁers, such as their unbalanced voltage across
output capacitors, high ripple at the output DC bus, and high THD in the supply current, etc.
The efﬁcacy of the proposed model has been veriﬁed by a series of simulations in PSIM. It is

101,FISTNet: FusIon of STyle-path generative Networks for facial style transfer,"abstraction
that exhibits an artistic effect is not achieved by doing so. Some studies
used supplementary segmentation or added user interaction to generate
cartoon portraits, respectively [18].
2.2. Style transfer networks
The use of style transfer was introduced to overcome the issues asso-
ciated with non-photorealistic rendering. The traditional style transfer
was proposed to generate stylized images using image training pairs.
The use of such methods was able to create good results but was
limited to a specific style. Researchers then proposed the use of the
VGG network [19] for style transfer, which was considered to be good
for extracting semantic features. The use of the VGG network also
eliminated the issue of using training pairs. The use of neural style
transfer was a good idea to start [20], but when using multiple faces,
the style is transferred in a homogeneous manner that fails to produce
smooth shading or clear edges. The study [21] used convolutional
neural network (CNN) based feature maps and Markov Random Field
for local matching to transfer the style. However, the transference
yields semantically incorrect output. A deep analogy-based method
was proposed in [22] to produce semantically correct output while
extracting meaningful correspondences. But it was limited to a single
style only and at times displayed undesirable results.
A dedicated CNN was recently used in the study [23] to classify
between the comic and non-comic images to cope with the problem
of undesirable results, but it was still limited to a single style. An
alternate and popular approach for style transfer has been generative
adversarial networks (GANs) [24]. In recent times, several studies have
proposed the use of GANs to solve problems concerning pixel-to-pixel
image synthesis. At the start, the GANs were considered impractical
due to the need for a large set of paired images [25]. This fundamental
issue was addressed by the study CycleGAN [26], which proposed a
way for image translation while using unpaired images. The works
such as GDWCT [27] and UNIT [28] perform similarly to CycleGAN
while considering special characteristics like clear edges and high-level
abstraction.
2.3. Image-to-image translation
Image-to-image translation is another technique to perform facial
style transfer [29,30]. Such a method relies on the bi-directional map-
ping between the style domain and the facial image [26]. One of the
seminal works on facial style transfer was the cartoonGAN [6], which
proposed using content loss to preserve facial characteristics while
performing the style transfer but was limited to a single style.
Some studies use attention mechanisms to find appearance discrep-
ancies between key regions [11], while others use shared discriminator
layers to extract features common in both domains [31]. The study [32]
learns style and content image features to generate caricature-style im-
ages through facial deformation and image warping, respectively. The
problem with bi-directional mapping is that it requires a long training
time and generates low-resolution images [16]. Olivier et al. [33] fo-
cused on implementing an image-to-image translation method that can
adopt 3D facial geometry to neutralize expressive faces. Subsequently,
the method uses SpiralNet++ and FUNIT to deform and blendshapes on
facial images for style transfer. They referred to their method as Face-
TuneGAN. Chen et al. [23] extended the work of AnimeGAN [2] and
proposed AnimationGAN thet uses bottlenecks in the residual network
and hybrid attention mechanism to improve upon the toonification of
the facial images. However, it is still limited to the style transfer of a
single style in an implicit manner. Liu et al. [34], and Melnik et al. [35]
conducted an extensive survey that highlights the studies performed
for editing and generating faces using StyleGAN and manipulation
of facial attributes. Both studies extensively layout the tasks existing
works perform to manipulate facial attributes using image-to-image
translation methods.
2.4. StyleGAN
Recently, StyleGAN was proposed to generate high-resolution im-
ages while performing facial style transfer [9]. Since the inception of
StyleGAN, several studies have considered fine-tuning it to generate
plausible results with limited data. The study [36] used fine-tuned
StyleGAN to generate cartoon faces by extracting latent embedding
and fine-tuned the model to perform semantic alignment for toonifying
the facial image. Some works extended the toonifying approach by
training the model on extremely limited data [37], efficient use of
latent code [38], and embedding acceleration [39]. The study [40]
introduced the use of exemplar style images instead of features ex-
tracted from fine-resolution-layer to generate better facial style transfer
images. However, without valid supervision, the model alignment gets
weakened, resulting in an efficient color transfer but does not perform
well while preserving structural information. Some studies have pro-
posed the use of cascaded StyleGANs, i.e. using the first StyleGAN to
extract style codes and the second to generate the stylized image. These
studies produce fixed-size images that hinder the generation of dynamic
faces [15]. The StyleGAN3 [41] was proposed to solve the problem of
unaligned faces, but it is still limited to the fixed-size image. Recently,
a study [16] proposed DualStyleGAN that uses an extrinsic style path to
overcome the model alignment problem and prior facial destylization.
Our work is different from the aforementioned ones, as first, it uses
pretrained encoders to generate base and secondary style images, and
second, aims to preserve the facial structures and details. A comparison
of the results generated using the proposed work with the existing ones
is shown in Fig."

ChatGPT is another large language model (LLM) vastly available for the consumers on their devices but due to its performance 
and ability to converse effectively, it has gained a huge popularity amongst research as well as industrial community. Recently, 
many studies have been published to show the effectiveness, efficiency, integration, and sentiments of chatGPT and other 
LLMs. In contrast, this study focuses on the important aspects that are mostly overlooked, i.e. sustainability, privacy, digital

undergo Sustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and Ethics (SPADE) evaluation. This paper discusses in detail the issues and 
concerns raised over chatGPT in line with aforementioned characteristics. We also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in 
accordance with the SPADE evaluation. We support our hypothesis by some preliminary data collection and visualizations 
along with hypothesized facts. We also suggest mitigations and recommendations for each of the concerns. Furthermore, we 
also suggest some policies and recommendations for EU AI policy act concerning ethics, digital divide, and sustainability."
101,Generalized Adaptive Spreading Modulation: A Novel Waveform for Integrated Sensing and Communication Oriented Vehicular Applications,"Abstract—This study aims to present a comparative analysis
of existing waveforms for integrated sensing and communica-
tion (ISAC) in vehicular environments. A novel multicarrier
framework called generalized adaptive spreading modulation
(GASM) is proposed for ISAC-enabled vehicular environments.
The GASM waveform offers symbol spreading in both time and
frequency domains with tunable spreading parameters, which
allows the proposed GASM-based waveform to adapt according
to the rapid time-frequency variations of the fading channel. This
helps to combat the most common system impairments, such as
carrier frequency offset (CFO) and symbol timing offset (STO).
The GASM scheme is the generalization of various existing
waveforms, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM), fractional Fourier transform-based OFDM (FrFT-
based OFDM), and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing
(OCDM). The proposed GASM-based ISAC system is evaluated

101,Joint Optimization of Semi-Passive IRS Phase Shifts and NOMA Power Coefficients for Cooperative CRNs,"Abstract—We investigate the incorporation of an intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) into cooperative spectrum-sharing cog-
nitive radio networks (CRNs). The CRN consists of a primary
user (PU) and multiple secondary users (SUs). There are two
transmission phases. In the first phase, the primary transmitter
is assisted by an IRS to serve the primary user (PU). This
arrangement allows the primary network to allocate a part of
its spectrum to the users within the secondary network. In the
subsequent phase, the secondary transmitter (ST) employs a
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique
to simultaneously serve the PU and secondary users (SUs). By
utilizing a semi-passive IRS, both data transmission to the PU and
channel estimation of SUs are performed simultaneously during
the first transmission phase. The main objective is to improve the
weighted sum-rate of the CRN through a joint optimization of
the NOMA power coefficients and IRS phase adjustments during
the second transmission phase. We propose an effective algorithm
that breaks down the primary sum-rate maximization problem
into two sub-problems where IRS phase shifts are computed
once at the beginning of the algorithm. Through simulations, we
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields substantial gains
in the sum-rate performance compared to existing methods."
101,"JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. , NO. , 2023 1","Abstract—The speedy proliferation of cloud storage choices
has prompted consumers to choose the cloud as a preferred
platform for storing their collections of images. However, this
trend also invokes fundamental security issues regarding image
privacy and data breach scenarios. To address these issues,
consumers have recently used miscellaneous traditional image
encryption techniques, primarily concentrated on preventing
unauthorized access to cloud-stored images to defend the privacy
of the image data. Moreover, these methods prioritize privacy
preservation, they often neglect the importance of maintaining
the usability of the encrypted images; hence, a Thumbnail-
preserving encryption (TPE) was newly raised to preserve the
thumbnail unchanged post-encryption, thereby improving the
prevailing usability of the stored image. Hence, legitimate con-
sumers can conveniently preview and control the cipher image
without decryption. PwLMµ −TPE scheme greatly decreases
encryption durations by approximately 17 times compared to
existing methods, achieving an expansion ratio of around 2.1 for
encrypted images and 1 for decrypted images, while showing
SSIM and PSNR values close to 0.9 and infinity, respectively,
along with an NPCR value of nearly 99%. The scheme is
favourably adequate to resist cryptographic attacks and ensures
usability and privacy, making it particularly suitable for cloud-
based applications."

101,XAI Driven Intelligent IoMT Secure Data Management Framework,"Abstract—The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has 
transformed traditional healthcare systems by enabling real-time 
monitoring, remote diagnostics, and data-driven treatment. 
However, security and privacy remain significant concerns for 
IoMT adoption due to the sensitive nature of medical data. 
Therefore, we propose an integrated framework leveraging 
blockchain and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable 
secure, intelligent, and transparent management of IoMT data. 
First, the traceability and tamper-proof of blockchain are used to 
realize the secure transaction of IoMT data, transforming the 
secure transaction of IoMT data into a two-stage Stackelberg 
game. The dual-chain architecture is used to ensure the security 
and privacy protection of the transaction. The main-chain 
manages regular IoMT data transactions, while the side-chain 
deals with data trading activities aimed at resale. Simultaneously, 
the perceptual hash technology is used to realize data rights 
confirmation, which maximally protects the rights and interests of 
each participant in the transaction. Subsequently, medical time-
series data is modeled using bidirectional simple recurrent units to 
detect anomalies and cyberthreats accurately while overcoming 
vanishing gradients. Lastly, an adversarial sample generation 
method based on local interpretable model-agnostic explanations 
is provided to evaluate, secure, and improve the anomaly detection 
model, as well as to make it more explainable and resilient to 
possible adversarial attacks. Simulation results are provided to 
illustrate the high performance of the integrated secure data

However, emerging applications like industrial automation and

platforms with integrated sensing, computing, and communication 
(as-ISCC-IoRT) capabilities. The framework leverages a model-
driven methodology to dynamically harness the benefits of 
complementary techniques for improving localization accuracy 
and operational efficiency. First, three classical sensing algorithms 
are introduced to realize multi-target ranging and speed

101,Designing process and analysis of a new SOI-MESFET structure with enhanced DC and RF characteristics for high-frequency and high-power applications,"Abstract
This research introduces a new designing process and analysis of an innovative Silicon-on-
Insulator Metal-Semiconductor Field-Effect (SOI MESFET) structure that demonstrates
improved DC and RF characteristics. The design incorporates several modifications to con-
trol and reduce the electric field concentration within the channel. These modifications
include relocating the transistor channel to sub-regions near the source and drain, adjusting
the position of the gate electrode closer to the source, introducing an aluminum layer
beneath the channel, and integrating an oxide layer adjacent to the gate. The results show
that the AlOx-MESFET configuration exhibits a remarkable increase of 128% in breakdown
voltage and 156% in peak power. Furthermore, due to enhanced conductivity and a signifi-
cant reduction in gate-drain capacitance, there is a notable improvement of 53% in the cut-
off frequency and a 28% increase in the maximum oscillation frequency. Additionally, the
current gain experiences a boost of 15%. The improved breakdown voltage and peak power
make it suitable for applications requiring robust performance under high voltage and power
conditions. The increased maximum oscillation frequency and cut-off frequency make it
ideal for high-frequency applications where fast signal processing is crucial. Moreover, the
enhanced current gain ensures efficient amplification of signals. The introduced SOI MES-
FET structure with its modifications offers significant improvements in various performance
metrics. It provides high oscillation frequency, better breakdown voltage and good cut-off
frequency, and current gain compared to the traditional designs. These enhancements
make it a highly desirable choice for applications that demand high-frequency and high-

modern communication systems mainly focus on the use of
edge computing devices for enabling immersive applications and
services. Federated learning is one of the preferred solutions
but it stresses the computation capability of the edge devices
for immersive applications. Much research is now focusing on
split learning as an alternative due to its ability of performing
joint training with limited computing resources. However, split
learning is also vulnerable to data reconstruction, feature space
hijacking, and model inversion attacks, which are quite common
concerning immersive applications such as Metaverse. In this
regard, we propose a ZEro-Trust Attack (ZETA) framework for
data reconstruction and model inversion attacks for autonomous

for commercial transportation and data collection in many
applications. Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to
support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and
connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common
altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data
collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being
sent to central servers to protect users’ privacy and reduce
communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient
only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute
for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient
Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive
Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a
modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the
accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-to-
Interference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate.
Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically
allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency
between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD
algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by
achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The
proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL
execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy
consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques."

scheme in NOMA multi-UAV (M-UAV) networks by utilizing
IRSs. The proposed scheme focuses on ground user equipment
(GUE) UAV association, UAV power allocation and IRS passive
beamforming (BF), with the objective of enhancing the system’s
spectral efﬁciency (SE) under the assumption of imperfect
successive interference cancellation (i-SIC). To tackle the non-
linearity of the problem, we ﬁrst perform GUE UAV association
for available power allocation and BF. Then, we decouple the
joint transmit power and BF design problem into two parts.
Subsequently, an efﬁcient solution is achieved by employing a
combination of sequential quadratic programming, successive
convex approximation, and difference-of-convex programming
techniques. Through comprehensive numerical evaluations, we
validate the effectiveness of the mathematical solution and
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed optimization scheme
over benchmark schemes. The results showcase notable perfor-
mance improvements in terms of SE, thereby highlighting the
potential beneﬁts that can be achieved by leveraging the proposed
approach in NOMA M-UAV networks."

unprecedented upsurge. The increasing energy consumption
owing to the massive machine type communication is the
main challenge in radio access networks (RANs). Thus, energy
optimized mobile networks are very important for sustainable
future green communication. This paper presents an efﬁcient
approach for improving the efﬁciency of RAN by proposing
an active-IRS aided framework. The multiple active IRSs assist
the user communication by amplifying the incident signals

through a proposed power consumption model with minimum

the network through a proposed algorithm. The system rate
and energy performance is obtained for different values of IRS
power budget, output power and amplitude gain subject to
the constraint of maximum ampliﬁcation power. It is observed
that maximum ampliﬁcation power Pmax of 20 dBm yields
maximum achievable rate of 16.2 bits/s/Hz. Also, the gain in

102,Investigating the impact of coarse aggregate dosage on the mechanical performance of 3D printable concrete,"Abstract
The effect of the addition of coarse aggregate on the direction-dependent mechanical performance of 3D printed mortar 
has been investigated. Coarse aggregates in the size range of 4.75–9.5 mm were manually added during printing into 3D 
printed mortar in 5, 10, and 15 (wt.% of mortar) dosages. The spilt tensile test indicates that the strengths of 3D printed 
mortar containing coarse aggregate are direction-dependent due to modified interlayer properties. The results of this study 
indicated an improved bonding effect in 3D printed mortar due to cross-layer nesting of the aggregates. The effect of coarse 
aggregate addition resulted in up to 32 and 19% increase in split tensile strength in Z- and Y-loading directions, respectively, 
compared to casted specimens. However, coarse aggregate weakens the split tensile strength in X-direction loading, whereas 
compressive and flexural strengths both commonly decrease with increasing aggregate dosage after an optimum dosage of 
aggregate addition due to their anisotropic characteristics."

102,Experimental and numerical evaluation of multi-,"ABSTRACT    Three-dimensional  concrete  printing  (3DCP)  can  proliferate  the  industrialization  of  the  construction
sector,  which  is  notoriously  conservative  and  indolent  toward  changes.  However,  the  mechanical  behavior  of  3DCP
should be characterized and modeled considering the interfaces when its performance is thoroughly compared to that of
the existing concrete construction methods. This study presents an experimental and numerical investigation of uniaxial
compression  and  three-point  bending  (TPB)  tests  on  extruded  3DCP  beams  in  different  loading  directions.  The
orientation of translational and depositional interfaces with respect to the direction of loading influenced the strength.
Both the elastic and post-damage behavior of the 3DCP specimens were compared with those of the conventionally cast
specimen  under  quasi-static  loading  conditions.  Despite  the  higher  compressive  strength  of  the  casted  specimen,  the
flexural strength of the 3DCP specimens was higher. This study employed the finite element and cohesive zone models
of the appropriate calibrated traction-separation law to model fracture in the notched TPB specimens. Furthermore, the
real-time acoustic emission test revealed the nature of failure phenomenon of three-dimensional-printed specimens under
flexion,  and  accordingly,  the  cohesive  law  was  chosen.  The  predicted  load−displacement  responses  are  in  good
agreement with the experimental results. Finally, the effects of cohesive thickness and notch shape on the performance
under bending were explored through parametric studies."
102,Stability of three-dimensional printable foam concrete as,"ABSTRACT    Extrudability  is  one  of  the  most  critical  factors  when  designing  three-dimensional  printable  foam
concrete.  The  extrusion  process  likely  affects  the  foam  stability  which  necessitates  the  investigation  into  surfactant
properties  particularly  for  concrete  mixes  with  high  foam  contents.  Although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  on
traditional foam concrete in this context, studies on three-dimensional printed foam concrete are scarce. To address this
research gap, the effects of surfactant characteristics on the stability, extrudability, and buildability of three-dimensional
printed  foam  concrete  mixes  with  two  design  densities  (1000  and  1300  kg/m3)  using  two  different  surfactants  and
stabilizers (synthetic-based sodium lauryl sulfate stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt, and natural-based
hingot surfactant stabilized with xanthan gum) were investigated in this study. Fresh density tests were conducted before
and  after  the  extrusion  to  determine  stability  of  the  foam  concrete.  The  results  were  then  correlated  with  surfactant
qualities, such as viscosity and surface tension, to understand the importance of key parameters in three-dimensional
printing of foam concrete. Based on the experimental results, surfactant solu1tion with viscosity exceeding 5 mPa·s and
surface tension lower than 31 mN/m was recommended to yield stable three-dimensional printable foam concrete mixes.
Nevertheless, the volume of foam in the mix significantly affected the printability characteristics. Unlike traditional foam
concrete, the variation in the stabilizer concentration and density of concrete were found to have insignificant effect on
the fresh-state-characteristics (slump, slump flow, and static yield stress) and air void microstructure of the stable mixes."
102,"Printability, Thermal and Compressive Strength Properties of Cementitious Materials: A Comparative Study with Silica Fume and Limestone","Abstract: Over the past decade, 3D printing in the construction industry has received worldwide
attention and developed rapidly. The research and development of cement and concrete products
has also become quite well-established over the years, while other sustainable materials receive
considerably lower attention in comparison. This study aims to investigate the inﬂuence of the
two most commonly used sustainable cementitious materials i.e., silica fume and limestone powder,
on printability, thermal and mechanical properties of ﬂy ash–Portland cement blends. Ternary blends
containing Portland cement, ﬂy ash and silica fume or limestone powder are prepared, whereas phase
change material (PCM) is introduced to improve the thermal behavior. Based on the rheological
properties and concurrent 3D concrete printing, improved buildability of the modiﬁed mixtures is
linked to their static yield stress. Anisotropic mechanical properties are observed for 3D printed
specimens, while cast specimens exhibit a maximum 41% higher compressive strength due to better
material compaction. It is clear from the results that addition of silica fume and limestone powder
ranged from 5% to 10%, reducing the anisotropic mechanical properties (maximum 71% and 68%
reduction in anisotropic factor, respectively) in the printed specimens. The PCM addition ranged
from 5% to 10% and improved thermal performance of the mixtures, as measured by a decrease
in thermal conductivity (9% and 13%) and an increase in volumetric heat capacity (9% and 10%),
respectively. However, the PCM-containing mixtures show around 29% reduction in compressive
strength, compared to the control specimen, which necessitates new material design considering
matrix strengthening methods."
102,Influence of Sugarcane Bagasse Ash and Silica Fume on the Mechanical and Durability Properties of Concrete,"Abstract: Cement production is environmentally unsustainable due to the high anthropogenic carbon
emissions produced. Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), derived from the by-products of
different industries, have been deemed an effective way to reduce carbon emissions. The reduction in
carbon emissions is achieved by lowering the clinker factor of cement, through a partial replacement
with an SCM. Sugarcane Bagasse Ash (SCBA) is produced as an agricultural waste from the sugarcane
industry and has gained a lot of attention for being a feasible and readily available pozzolanic material,
underutilised as an SCM. This study evaluates alkali-activated sugarcane bagasse ash’s mechanical
and durability performance, at varied contents, in binary blended cement concrete and ternary
blended cement concrete containing silica fume (SF). Potassium Hydroxide (KOH), used as the alkali
activator, is intended to enhance the reactivity of the ash, with the possibility of a high-volume SCBA
content. The mechanical performance was investigated by compressive and split tensile strength
tests, and durability performance was investigated using the Oxygen Permeability Index (OPI) test.
In addition, a micro-CT porosity test was conducted to assess how the microstructure and porosity
of the concrete affect the mechanical and durability performance. The results indicated that using
SCBA in a ternary blend with SF can signiﬁcantly improve the overall performance and create less
porous concrete. At 30% SCBA and 10% SF replacement, the performance tests revealed the highest
mechanical strength and the lowest permeability, outperforming the control concrete and the binary
blended cement concrete containing only SCBA."

102,"Microbiologically Induced Concrete Corrosion: A Concise Review of Assessment Methods, Effects, and Corrosion-Resistant Coating Materials","Abstract: Microbiologically induced concrete corrosion (in wastewater pipes) occurs mainly because
of the diffusion of aggressive solutions and in situ production of sulfuric acid by microorganisms.
The prevention of concrete biocorrosion usually requires modiﬁcation of the mix design or the
application of corrosion-resistant coatings, which requires a fundamental understanding of the
corrosion process. In this regard, a state-of-the-art review on the subject is presented in this paper,
which ﬁrstly details the mechanism of microbial deterioration, followed by assessment methods to
characterize biocorrosion and its effects on concrete properties. Different types of corrosion-resistant
coatings are also reviewed to prevent biocorrosion in concrete sewer and waste-water pipes. At the
end, concluding remarks, research gaps, and future needs are discussed, which will help to overcome
the challenges and possible environmental risks associated with biocorrosion."
102,3D printability of ternary Portland cement mixes containing fly ash and limestone,"Abstract 
This paper reports the influence of limestone, by partial replacement of fly ash, on the fresh properties, printability, and interlayer 
bond strength of 3D printed high volume fly ash mortar. Limestone powders at replacement levels between 0-15% (mass basis) 
were used to proportion ternary binder formulations. The incorporation of limestone alters fresh properties like slump, slump flow, 
yield stress. It was observed from the results of 3D printing test that ternary mixes with limestone demonstrates higher buildability. 
Based on the material relative deformation at different times and concurrent printing, mix design was linked to the printing 
performance. However, interlayer bond strength was found to be decreased as the limestone dosage increased. Surprisingly, the 
bond strength measured using layer split tensile strength in the bottom layers of high buildable mixture was observed to be lower 
followed by middle and top layers. This is due to an overestimation of bond strength caused by X-directional porosity (i.e. printing 
direction) resulting from increased nozzle standoff distance induced by bottom layer suppression."
103,Sparse Sonomyography-Based Estimation of Isometric Force: A Comparison of Methods and Features,"Abstract—Noninvasive methods for estimation of joint and
muscle forces have widespread clinical and research applica-
tions. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a measure of
the neural activation of muscles which can be used to estimate
the force produced by the muscle. However, sEMG based mea-
sures of force suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio and limited
spatiotemporal speciﬁcity. In this paper, we propose a sono-
myography or ultrasound imaging-based ofﬂine approach for
estimating continuous isometric force from a sparse set of ultra-
sound scanlines. Our approach isolates anatomically relevant
features from A-mode scanlines isolated from B-mode images,
thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and
the computational complexity involved in traditional ultrasound-
based methods. We evaluate the performance of four regression
methodologies for force prediction using the reduced sonomyo-
graphic feature set. We also evaluate the feasibility of a practical
wearable sonomyography-based system by simulating the effect
of transducer placement and varying the number of transducers
used in force prediction. Our results demonstrate that Gaussian
process regression models outperform other regression methods
in predicting continuous force levels from just four equispaced
transducers in ofﬂine settings. We believe that these ﬁndings will
aid in the design of wearable, robust and computationally efﬁcient
sonomyography-based force prediction systems."
103,Classification Performance and Feature Space Characteristics in Individuals With Upper Limb Loss Using Sonomyography,"ABSTRACT
Objective: Sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, is an emerging
modality for upper limb prosthesis control. Although prior studies have shown that individuals with
upper limb loss can achieve successful motion classiﬁcation with sonomyography, it is important to
better understand the time-course over which proﬁciency develops. In this study, we characterized user
performance during their initial and subsequent exposures to sonomyography. Method: Ultrasound images
corresponding to a series of hand gestures were collected from individuals with transradial limb loss under
three scenarios: during their initial exposure to sonomyography (Experiment 1), during a subsequent exposure
to sonomyography where they were provided biofeedback as part of a training protocol (Experiment 2),
and during testing sessions held on different days (Experiment 3). User performance was characterized
by ofﬂine classiﬁcation accuracy, as well as metrics describing the consistency and separability of the
sonomyography signal patterns in feature space. Results: Classiﬁcation accuracy was high during initial
exposure to sonomyography (96.2 ± 5.9%) and did not systematically change with the provision of
biofeedback or on different days. Despite this stable classiﬁcation performance, some of the feature space
metrics changed. Conclusions: User performance was strong upon their initial exposure to sonomyography
and did not improve with subsequent exposure. Clinical Impact: Prosthetists may be able to quickly assess if
a patient will be successful with sonomyography without submitting them to an extensive training protocol,
leading to earlier socket fabrication and delivery."
103,Wearable Ultrasound System Using Low-Voltage Time Delay Spectrometry for Dynamic Tissue Imaging,"Abstract— Objective: Wearable ultrasound is emerging as a new
paradigm of real-time imaging in freely moving humans and has
wide applications from cardiovascular health monitoring to hu-
man gesture recognition. However, current wearable ultrasound
devices have typically employed pulse-echo imaging which re-
quires high excitation voltages and sampling rates, posing safety
risks, and requiring specialized hardware. Our objective was to
develop and evaluate a wearable ultrasound system based on time
delay spectrometry (TDS) that utilizes low-voltage excitation and
significantly simplified instrumentation.
Methods: We developed a TDS-based ultrasound system that
utilizes continuous, frequency-modulated sweeps at low excitation
voltages. By mixing the transmit and receive signals, the system
digitizes the ultrasound signal at audio frequency (kHz) sampling
rates. Wearable ultrasound transducers were developed, and the
system was characterized in terms of imaging performance, acous-
tic output, thermal characteristics, and applications in muscu-
loskeletal imaging.
Results: The prototype TDS system is capable of imaging up to
6 cm of depth with signal-to-noise ratio of up to 42 dB at a spatial
resolution of 0.33 mm. Acoustic and thermal radiation measure-
ments were within clinically safe limits for continuous ultrasound
imaging. We demonstrated the ability to use a 4-channel wearable
system for dynamic imaging of muscle activity.
Conclusion: We developed a wearable ultrasound imaging sys-
tem using TDS to mitigate challenges with pulse echo-based wear-
able ultrasound imaging systems. Our device is capable of high-
resolution, dynamic imaging of deep-seated tissue structures and
is safe for long-term use.
Significance: This work paves the way for low-voltage wearable
ultrasound imaging devices with significantly reduced hardware
complexity."
103,SonoMyoNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Isometric Force From Highly Sparse Ultrasound Images,"Abstract—Ultrasound imaging or sonomyography has been
found to be a robust modality for measuring muscle activity due
to its ability to image deep-seated muscles directly while pro-
viding superior spatiotemporal speciﬁcity compared with surface
electromyography-based techniques. Quantifying the morpholog-
ical changes during muscle activity involves computationally ex-
pensive approaches for tracking muscle anatomical structures or
extracting features from brightness-mode (B-mode) images and
amplitude-mode signals. This article uses an ofﬂine regression
convolutional neural network called SonoMyoNet to estimate con-
tinuous isometric force from sparse ultrasound scanlines. SonoMy-
oNet learns features from a few equispaced scanlines selected from
B-mode images and utilizes the learned features to estimate contin-
uous isometric force accurately. The performance of SonoMyoNet
was evaluated by varying the number of scanlines to simulate
the placement of multiple single-element ultrasound transducers
in a wearable system. Results showed that SonoMyoNet could
accurately predict isometric force with just four scanlines and is
immune to speckle noise and shifts in the scanline location. Thus,
the proposed network reduces the computational load involved in
feature tracking algorithms and estimates muscle force from the
global features of sparse ultrasound images."
103,Design and Psychophysical Validation of a Slip Induction Device for Sensorimotor Evaluation of Prehensile Grip,"Abstract—The purpose of this study was to investigate
the psychophysical understanding of a slip stimulus applied
at the fingertips. We hypothesized that the perception of
slip and its characteristics, such as slip distance and slip
speed depends on the interaction between slip direction, slip
distance, and slip speed. We developed a novel slip induction
device to simulate the artificial sense of slip for prehensile
grasps. We conducted a psychophysical experiment on eight
healthy subjects. The experiment was designed to evaluate
the effect of slip direction on slip perception as well as on
the perception of slip distance and slip speed. A series of
psychophysical questions were asked at the end of the slip
stimulus to record the subjective responses of the partici-
pants. The average perceptual accuracy (PA) (%) was used to quantify the subject responses. We showed that the
perception of slip during a prehensile grasp is independent of slip direction, but slip direction significantly modulates the
perception of slip distance and slip speed. We also observed that a significant interaction exists between slip distance
and slip speed in the upward slip direction. It was also observed that the average PA was significantly different for various
combinations of slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. This study clearly establishes an interaction
between the slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed for prehensile grasps. Our findings may have a direct impact on
grip function assessment and rehabilitation for individuals with sensorimotor deficits."
103,Sparse Wearable Sonomyography Sensor-Based Proprioceptive Proportional Control Across Multiple Gestures,"Abstract—Sonomyography (SMG) is a noninvasive tech-
nique that uses ultrasound imaging to detect the dynamic
activity of muscles. Wearable SMG systems have recently
gained popularity due to their potential as human–computer
interfaces for their superior performance compared with
conventional methods. This article demonstrates real-time
positional proportional control of multiple gestures using
a multiplexed eight-channel wearable SMG system. The
amplitude-mode ultrasound signals from the SMG system
were utilized to detect muscle activity from the forearm of
eight healthy individuals. The derived SMG signals were used
to control the on-screen position of the cursor. A target
achievement task was performed to analyze the performance
of our SMG-based human–machine interface. Our wearable SMG system provided accurate, stable, and intuitive control
in real time by achieving an average success rate greater than 80% with all gestures. Furthermore, the wearable SMG
system’s abilities to detect volitional movement and decode movement kinematic information from SMG trajectories
using standard performance metrics were evaluated. Our results provide insights to validate SMG as an intuitive
human–machine interface."
103,A Sonomyography-Based Muscle Computer Interface for Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury,"Abstract—Impairment of hand functions in individuals
with spinal cord injury (SCI) severely disrupts activities
of daily living. Recent advances have enabled rehabilita-
tion assisted by robotic devices to augment the residual
function of the muscles. Traditionally, electromyography-
based muscle activity sensing interfaces have been utilized
to sense volitional motor intent to drive robotic assistive
devices. However, the dexterity and ﬁdelity of control that
can be achieved with electromyography-based control have
been limited due to inherent limitations in signal quality.
We have developed and tested a muscle-computer inter-
face (MCI) utilizing sonomyography to provide control of a
virtual cursor for individuals with motor-incomplete spinal
cord injury. We demonstrate that individuals with SCI suc-
cessfully gained control of a virtual cursor by utilizing con-
tractions of muscles of the wrist joint. The sonomyography-
based interface enabled control of the cursor at multiple
graded levels demonstrating the ability to achieve accurate
and stable endpoint control. Our sonomyography-based
muscle-computer interface can enable dexterous control

103,Multilayer Label-Free Non-Faradic Electrochemical Impedance Immunosensor for Cortisol Detection,"Abstract—Cortisol, a well-known psychological stress
biomarker, produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) system, tends to intensify with stressors. Prolonged
overexpression of cortisol leads to chronic stress that
causes disparities in the proper functioning of the human
body. Thus, there is a huge demand for developing a rapid
cortisol detection system. Several point-of-care diagnostic
techniques are available for rapid cortisol detection, such
as electrochemical sensing, which works on changes in the
electrical properties due to the binding of an analyte with
a biorecognition element. Researchers have used different
electrochemical methodologies, such as cyclic voltamme-
try (CV), chronoamperometry, and faradic electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), for the detection of cortisol.
Still, the usage of external redox active reagents, low sen-
sitivity, limited dynamic range, and electrode fouling nature
limits their use. Hence, we reported a label-free and noninvasive cortisol detection using non-faradic EIS. A novel
multilayer immunosensor was fabricated on poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-
coated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass by functionalizing with cortisol antibodies. Specific and rapid detection of cortisol
was measured by monitoring the change in impedance in a dynamic range of 50–200 ng/mL. A robust correlation of
0.97 was observed between impedance values and cortisol concentration, highlighting the linearity and repeatability of
the sensor. We envision that the developed immunosensor has the potential for new developments in stress monitoring,
disease prognosis, and personalized care."

is
an
ultrasound-imaging-based
technique that measures muscle activity. Real-time imaging
of deep-seated muscle activity enables robust and intuitive
biomechatronic control. However, the form factor of clinical
ultrasound systems limits the practical utility of sonomyography.
Therefore, recent investigations aim towards developing wearable
ultrasound systems to utilize sonomyography for biomechatronic
interfacing. In this paper, a wearable, multiplexed sonomyog-
raphy transducer array for real-time sensing muscle activity
has been presented. The forearm-muscle activity was quantified
using a computationally inexpensive, correlation-based metric to
generate a sonomyography signal. The sonomyography signal was
then used to perform a human-computer interaction-based target
achievement task involving one degree of freedom control in real-
time. Results show that participants achieved the targets with
an average success rate of > 96 % for a target width of 10%,
with minimal training. The results demonstrate the potential
of a multiplexed sonomyography system for intuitive control of
biomechatronic interfaces.

103,Design and Optimization of a Wearable Sonomyography Sensor for Dynamic Muscle Activity Monitoring,"Abstract—Sonomyography is a non-invasive modality that uses
ultrasound for sensing muscle activity. The ability of this modality
to robustly sense muscle activity with good resolution makes
it suitable as a biomechatronic control interface. However, the
most sonomyography-based studies utilize B-mode ultrasound
imaging which require large form-factor clinical ultrasound
imaging devices. In order to extend the utility of sonomyography
techniques to wearable systems, the size of the ultrasound system
and associated sensors needs to be greatly reduced. In this
paper, we design and optimize the performance of a wearable
ultrasound sensor for muscle activity monitoring applications.
We fabricated a custom ultrasound transducer with a backing
layer by mixing varying amounts of Tungsten powder to epoxy
resin to optimize the bandwidth of the transducer. Our results
showed that increasing the proportion of Tungsten improves
the bandwidth of the transducers. Following optimization of
the transducer design, we developed a wearable sonomyography
sensor and demonstrated real-time measurement of dynamic
muscle activity during hand open-close movement."
103,ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING  SONOMYOGRAPHY  FOR UPPER ,"ABSTRACT 
Sonomyography (SMG), or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, is an emerging modality for upper 
limb prosthesis control with potential to significantly improve functionality. SMG enables spatiotemporal 
characterization of both superficial and deep muscle activity, making it possible to distinguish the independent 
contributions of individual muscles during functional movements. Early offline studies have shown that SMG is 
capable of accurately classifying motor intent among able-bodied individuals, but it has not yet been shown whether 
individuals with upper limb absence can successfully use this modality for prosthesis control. This paper describes 
our ongoing work towards implementing SMG control for individuals with upper limb absence in offline and real-
time settings. We provide strong evidence supporting the feasibility of using SMG to control upper limb prostheses."

103,Towards Deep Learning-Based Classification of Multiple Gestures using Sonomyography for Prosthetic Control Applications,"Abstract—Intuitive control of multi articulated prosthetic de-
vices remains a challenge due to inherent shortcomings in
surface electromyography-based control modalities. As a result,
sonomyography or ultrasound imaging-based methods of muscle
activity sensing and control of bionics devices have emerged
as an attractive alternative to traditional myoelectric control
methodologies. However, most sonomyography-based techniques
involve extraction and analysis of image features from B-mode
ultrasound images to predict gestures. Additionally, ultrasound
probe shift during the experiment has a detrimental effect on
prediction accuracies. Therefore, to address these challenges we
develop a deep-learning-based method to automatically identify
four hand gestures: hand open, power grasp, index pointing, and
tripod. Hand orientation variations were included by performing
lateral and transverse hand movement, wrist supination, and
pronation. We fine-tuned four deep-learning models (AlexNet,
ResNet18, DarkNet19, and VGG16) using 4000 2D ultrasound
images of forearm muscle deformation. Results show that a fine-
tuned VGG16 outperformed other architectures by achieving
98.7 % cross-validation accuracy."
103,Design and Characterization of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Transceiver-based Ultrasound Imaging System,"Abstract—Conventional pulse-echo based ultrasound imaging
systems utilize high-voltage and short-duration transmit signaling
and require high-speed digitization to measure the time-of-
flight of received echos. As a result, pulse-echo based imaging
systems require bulky and complex analog as well as digital
hardware. Frequency modulated continuous wave ultrasound
(FMCW) systems are an attractive alternative where low-voltage
continuous wave signaling is used for imaging. This paradigm
lowers peak power consumption and the received echos can be
demodulated to baseband frequency range and therefore digitized
at a significantly lower sampling rate. In this work, we design
and develop a FMCW-based ultrasound imaging device with
the complete transmit and receive signal chain. We have fully
characterized the electrical as well as acoustic parameters in
order to fully optimize ultrasound imaging performance. The
current consumption of our system is 80 mA and the optimum
sweep time has been found to be 20 ms for the sweep range
of 2-3 MHz. We demonstrate A-mode imaging with our FMCW
ultrasound imaging system and believe that our design can be
effectively utilized in wearable applications."
103,"A NOVEL METHOD FOR A CHIEVING DEXTEROUS, PROPORTIONAL ","ABSTRACT 
Although myoelectric upper limb prostheses have been 
commercially available for decades, many patients who 
receive these devices abandon them due to their limited 
functionality. Some of these functional limitations are related 
to the difficulties in sensing activity in different muscle 
compartments with surface electromyography. We believe it 
is possible to overcome the limitations of myoelectric control 
through use of sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing 
of 
muscle deformation. 
Sonomyography can better 
distinguish individual muscle activity and provides access to 
control signals that are directly proportional to muscle 
deformation, which has the potential to significantly improve 
prosthesis functionality. In this paper, we will describe our 
work towards developing a low-power wearable imaging 
system that will enable sonomyographically-controlled 
prostheses."
103,Sonomyography Combined with Vibrotactile Feedback Enables Precise Target Acquisition Without Visual Feedback,"Abstract— Upper limb prosthesis users currently lack haptic
feedback from their terminal devices, which signiﬁcantly limits
their ability to meaningfully interact with their environment.
Users therefore rely heavily on visual feedback when using
terminal devices. Previously, it has been shown that force-
related feedback from an end-effector or virtual environment
can help the user minimize errors and improve performance.
Currently, myoelectric control systems enable the user to
control the velocity of terminal devices. We have developed
a novel control method using ultrasound sensing, called sono-
myography, that enables position control based on mechanical
deformation of muscles. In this paper, we investigated whether
the proprioceptive feedback from muscle deformation combined
with vibrotactile haptic feedback can minimize the need for
visual feedback. Able bodied subjects used sonomyography to
control a virtual cursor, and performed a target acquisition
task. The effect of visual and haptic feedback on performance
of a target acquisition task was systematically tested. We found
that subjects made large errors when they tried to reacquire a
target without visual feedback, but in the presence of real-time
haptic feedback, the precision of the target position improved,
and were similar to when visual feedback was used for target
acquisition. This result has implications for improving the
performance of prosthetic control systems.

103,untitled,"Abstract—Objective: Sonomyography has been shown to
be a promising method for decoding volitional motor intent
from analysis of ultrasound images of the forearm muscu-
lature. The objectives of this paper are to determine the
optimal location for ultrasound transducer placement on
the anterior forearm for imaging maximum muscle deforma-
tions during different hand motions, and to investigate the
effect of using a sparse set of ultrasound scanlines for mo-
tion classiﬁcation for ultrasound-based muscle–computer
interfaces (MCIs). Methods: The optimal placement of the
ultrasound transducer along the forearm was identiﬁed us-
ing freehand three-dimensional reconstructions of the mus-
cle thickness during rest and motion completion. Based on
the ultrasound images acquired from the optimally placed
transducer, classiﬁcation accuracy with equally spaced
scanlines across the cross-sectional ﬁeld of view was deter-
mined. Furthermore, the unique contribution of each scan-
line to class discrimination using Fisher criterion (FC) and
mutual information (MI) with respect to motion discrim-
inability was determined. Results: Experiments with ﬁve
able-bodied subjects show that the maximum muscle defor-
mation occurred between 40%–50% of the forearm length
for multiple degrees-of-freedom. The average classiﬁcation
accuracy was 94% ± 6% with the entire 128-scanline image
and 94% ± 5% with four equally spaced scanlines. How-
ever, no signiﬁcant improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy
was observed with optimal scanline selection using FC and
MI. Conclusion: For an optimally placed transducer, a small
subset of ultrasound scanlines can be used instead of a
full imaging array without sacriﬁcing performance in terms
of classiﬁcation accuracy for multiple degrees-of-freedom.
Signiﬁcance: The selection of a small subset of transducer
elements can enable the reduction of computation, and sim-
pliﬁcation of the instrumentation and power consumption of
wearable sonomyographic MCIs, particularly for rehabilita-
tion and gesture recognition applications.

103,Evaluation of the Role of Proprioception During Proportional Position Control Using Sonomyography: Applications in Prosthetic Control,"Abstract— Prosthetics need to incorporate the users sense of
proprioception into the control paradigm to provide intuitive
control, and reduce training times and prosthetic rejection
rates. In the absence of functional tasks with a prosthetic,
virtual cursor control tasks have been used to train users
to control multiple degrees of freedom. In this study, A pro-
portional position signal was derived from the cross-sectional
ultrasound images of the users forearm. We designed a virtual
cursor control task with one degree of freedom to measure
the users ability to repeatably and accurately acquire different
levels of muscle ﬂexion, using only their sense of proprioception.
The experiment involved a target acquisition task, where the
cursors height corresponded to the extent of muscle ﬂexion.
Users were asked to acquire targets on a screen. Visual feedback
was disabled at certain times during the experiment, to isolate
the effect of proprioception. We found that as visual feedback
was taken away from the subjects, position error increased but
their stability error did not change signiﬁcantly. This indicates
that users are not perfect at using only their proprioceptive
sense to reacquire a level of muscle ﬂexion, in the absence of
haptic or visual feedback. However, they are adept at retaining
an acquired ﬂexion level without drifting. These results could
help to quantify the role of proprioception in target acquisition
tasks, in the absence of haptic or visual feedback.

103,Real-time non-uniform surface refinement model for lung adenocarcinoma surgery,"Abstract
Soft tissue models play a crucial role in virtual surgery. However, most existing methods use uniform meshes and overall 
refinement to construct inhomogeneous soft tissues for virtual lungs. This leads to a complex computation and poor model 
realism. Therefore, a real-time non-uniform surface refinement model (RNSM) for lung adenocarcinoma surgery is proposed 
in this paper. First, to better describe the inhomogeneous soft tissues, the tetrahedra are subdivided to different degrees 
depending on their densities, which reduce the model’s complexity while ensuring accuracy. Second, to improve the model 
accuracy, the model surface is subdivided using the Loop subdivision method. Finally, an optimal algorithm based on defor-
mation radius is designed to enhance the deformation in real-time, in which a linear attenuation method of physical quantities 
is used to simulate the deformation of the weak deformation regions directly, and the finite element method (FEM) is used 
for the strong deformation regions. The experimental results show that the model is more accurate and faster than the exist-
ing soft tissue models for lung adenocarcinoma surgery simulation."
103,RIS-assisted device-edge collaborative edge computing for industrial applications,"Abstract
In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a significant amount of perceived data is generated from massive IoT devices, which 
requires timely computing for value maximization. Multi-access edge computing (MEC), which deploys computing nodes 
close to the data source, is a promising computing paradigm for IIoT applications. However, due to the limited computa-
tion resource, it is challenging for edge nodes to provide a low delay to massive data. In addition, the wireless transmission 
environment varies with IoT devices over time. Some data even cannot be uploaded to the edge server due to the worse link 
quality. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which deploys passive reflecting elements between end users and base sta-
tion to reflect wireless signals, is a new technique for changing the wireless transmission performance via reconfiguring the 
phase shift of RIS. It is beneficial to apply RIS in MEC for reducing transmission delay and achieving green edge computing. 
This paper considers a RIS-assisted device-edge collaborative MEC for industrial applications. We propose to minimize 
the energy consumption of IoT devices constrained to the delay requirements via jointly optimizing the offloading decisions 
between end and edge computing nodes, the phase shift of RIS, CPU resource allocation of edge server, and transmission 
power of IoT devices. A distributed and cooperative scheme, called RIS-assisted DAEM, which includes the DAECO and 
DCEM algorithms for CO and PORA subproblems, respectively, is proposed to solve the formulated problem. The simulation 
results have illustrated the efficiency of the proposal for energy consumption reduction constrained to the delay requirements."
103,Point-attention Net: a graph attention convolution network for point cloudsegmentation,"Abstract
Point cloud classification and segmentation is a crucial yet challenging step towards 3D scene understanding. In response
to the fact that 3D point clouds cannot be directly applied to traditional 2D image convolutional neural networks and
sparse point cloud features are difficult to capture, an improved segmentation network Point-Attention Net is proposed. In
comparison with existing techniques, the proposed method models on point cloud directly, avoiding the extra computational
and memory cost of converting point cloud to other forms. It also employs a novel proportional discrete dilation model
for analyzing the features of a point cloud on different scales simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed method combines
the graph attention convolution and adaptive weight assignment techniques, yielding better segmentation performance on
the edge point cloud and more accurate analysis of the adjacency and spatial geometric distribution. Experimental results
show that our algorithm achieves 64.56 % and 74.1 % IoU on average on S3DIS and Semantic3D datasets respectively,
outperforming the state of the art."
104,Deep Neural Network-based Empirical Mode Decomposition for Motor Imagery EEG Classification,"Abstract— Motor imagery refers to the brain’s response
during the mental simulation of physical activities, which
can be detected through electroencephalogram (EEG) sig-
nals. However, EEG signals exhibit a low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) due to various artifacts originating from other
physiological sources. To enhance the classification per-
formance of motor imagery tasks by increasing the SNR
of EEG signals, several signal decomposition approaches
have been proposed. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
has shown promising results in extracting EEG compo-
nents associated with motor imagery tasks more effectively
than traditional linear decomposition algorithms such as
Fourier and wavelet methods. Nevertheless, the EMD-based
algorithm suffers from a significant challenge known as
mode mixing, where frequency components intertwine with
the intrinsic mode functions obtained through EMD. This is-
sue severely hampers the accuracy of motor imagery clas-
sification. Despite numerous algorithms proposed, mode
mixing remains a persistent issue. In this paper, we pro-
pose the Deep-EMD algorithm, a deep neural network-
based approach to mode mixing problem. We employ two
datasets to compare the motor imagery classification and
mode mixing improvement achieved by the conventional
EMD algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the Deep-EMD algorithm effectively mitigates the mode
mixing problem in decomposed EEG components, leading
to improved motor imagery classification performance."
104,"21604 IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL, VOL. 11, NO. 12, 15 JUNE 2024","Abstract—Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) has been
rigorously extending its applications to hospitals to deliver
important medical data remotely and continuously with various
types of smart medical sensors. Medical data of patients should be
treated with different urgency levels. Speciﬁcally, critical medical
data, such as data pertaining, to heart failure or fall risk must be
transmitted ﬁrst with the highest priority. Thus, priority-aware
scheduling for H-IoT networks is required to improve the quality
of medical services. However, due to the high-dense nature of
H-IoT networks, interference and packet collisions can make
ﬁnding the optimal priority-aware scheduling very challenging.
To tackle these practical issues, we develop a priority-aware
scheduling algorithm based on a message-passing framework.
With a message-passing procedure that relies on a max-product
rule, the proposed algorithm simultaneously maximizes the
priority metric and throughput of the network. In addition,
the proposed algorithm efﬁciently ﬁnds the best scheduling

104,Energy-Efficient PPG-Based Respiratory Rate Estimation Using Spiking Neural Networks,"Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital indicator for assessing the bodily functions and health status
of patients. RR is a prominent parameter in the field of biomedical signal processing and is strongly
associated with other vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Various
physiological signals, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, are used to extract respiratory
information. RR is also estimated by detecting peak patterns and cycles in the signals through signal
processing and deep-learning approaches. In this study, we propose an end-to-end RR estimation
approach based on a third-generation artificial neural network model—spiking neural network.
The proposed model employs PPG segments as inputs, and directly converts them into sequential
spike events. This design aims to reduce information loss during the conversion of the input data
into spike events. In addition, we use feedback-based integrate-and-fire neurons as the activation
functions, which effectively transmit temporal information. The network is evaluated using the
BIDMC respiratory dataset with three different window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). The proposed model
achieves mean absolute errors of"
104,Predicting Car Rental Prices: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models,"Abstract: In modern times, people predominantly use personal vehicles as a means of transportation,
and, as this trend has developed, services that enable consumers to rent vehicles instead of buying
their own have emerged. These services have grown into an industry, and the demand for predicting
rental prices has arisen with the number of consumers. This study addresses the challenge in accu-
rately predicting rental prices using big data with numerous features, and presents the experiments
conducted and results obtained by applying various machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance the
prediction accuracy. Our experiment was conducted in two parts: single- and multi-step forecasting.
In the single-step forecasting experiment, we employed random forest regression (RFR), multilayer
perceptron (MLP), 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM),
and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict car rental prices and
compared the results of each model. In the multi-step forecasting experiment, rental prices after 7, 14,
21 and 30 days were predicted using the algorithms applied in single-step forecasting. The prediction
performance was improved by applying Bayesian optimization hyperband. The experimental results
demonstrate that the LSTM and ARIMA models were effective in predicting car rental prices. Based
on these results, useful information could be provided to both rental car companies and consumers."
104,Unsupervised Spiking Neural Network with Dynamic Learning of Inhibitory Neurons,"Abstract: A spiking neural network (SNN) is a type of artiﬁcial neural network that operates based
on discrete spikes to process timing information, similar to the manner in which the human brain
processes real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a new spiking neural network (SNN) based
on conventional, biologically plausible paradigms, such as the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre model, spike
timing-dependent plasticity, and the adaptive spiking threshold, by suggesting new biological models;
that is, dynamic inhibition weight change, a synaptic wiring method, and Bayesian inference. The
proposed network is designed for image recognition tasks, which are frequently used to evaluate the
performance of conventional deep neural networks. To manifest the bio-realistic neural architecture,
the learning is unsupervised, and the inhibition weight is dynamically changed; this, in turn, affects
the synaptic wiring method based on Hebbian learning and the neuronal population. In the inference
phase, Bayesian inference successfully classiﬁes the input digits by counting the spikes from the
responding neurons. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed biological model
ensures a performance improvement compared with other biologically plausible SNN models."
104,GAN-based patient information hiding for an ECG authentication system,"Abstract
Various biometrics such as the face, irises, and fingerprints, which can be obtained in a relatively simple way in modern 
society, are used in personal authentication systems to identify individuals. These biometric data are extracted from an indi-
vidual’s physiological data and yield high performance in identifying an individual using unique data patterns. Biometric 
identification is also used in portable devices such as mobile devices because it is more secure than cryptographic token-based 
authentication methods. However, physiological data could include personal health information such as arrhythmia related 
patterns in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To protect sensitive health information from hackers, the biomarkers of certain 
diseases or disorders that exist in ECG signals need to be hidden. Additionally, to implement the inference models for both 
arrhythmia detection and personal authentication in a mobile device, a lightweight model such as a multi-task deep learning 
model should be considered. This study demonstrates a multi-task neural network model that simultaneously identifies an 
individual’s ECG and arrhythmia patterns using a small network. Finally, the computational efficiency and model size of 
the single-task and multi-task models were compared based on the number of parameters. Although the multi-task model 
has 20,000 fewer parameters than the single-task model, they yielded similar performance, which demonstrates the efficient 
structure of the multi-task model."
104,Blood pressure estimation and its recalibration assessment using wrist cuff blood pressure monitor,"Abstract
The rapid evolution of wearable technology in healthcare sectors has created the opportunity for people to measure their 
blood pressure (BP) using a smartwatch at any time during their daily activities. Several commercially-available wearable 
devices have recently been equipped with a BP monitoring feature. However, concerns about recalibration remain. Pulse 
transit time (PTT)-based estimation is required for initial calibration, followed by periodic recalibration. Recalibration using 
arm-cuff BP monitors is not practical during everyday activities. In this study, we investigated recalibration using PTT-based 
BP monitoring aided by a deep neural network (DNN) and validated the performance achieved with more practical wrist-
cuff BP monitors. The PTT-based prediction produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.746 ±"
104,Hierarchical Affinity Propagation for Reliable Integrated Multilayer V2X Networks,"Abstract—The integration of IEEE802.11p and 5G New Radio
for the backbone transmission of vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
technology has served as a novel type of intelligent transporta-
tion system with an efﬁcient low-cost and high-coverage area.
This integrated scheme implements a V2X end-to-end data deliv-
ery system in a multilayer mechanism. However, the dynamic
nature of vehicular networks leads to numerous network out-
ages and frequent network renewal requests, which considerably
diminishes the overall performance. Hence, efﬁcient routing
management is required to maximize reliable communication.
Optimizing routing management is categorized as a nonlinear
problem with a very high computational load, making a prac-
tical solution very challenging. To cope with the complicated
routing problem, we develop a low-complexity distributed algo-
rithm based on a hierarchical afﬁnity propagation framework.
The proposed algorithm exchanges small-sized messages among
local vehicles to determine data routing more efﬁciently. The dis-
tributive optimization of the proposed algorithm requires a small
computational load for each node. The main advantage of the
proposed algorithm is that each vehicle autonomously determines
its best routing options without the help of any network coor-
dinators. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed
algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of vehi-
cle mobility, network scalability, the level of network overhead,
and the algorithm convergence rate."
104,Intelligent Feature Selection for ECG-Based Personal Authentication Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract: In this study, the optimal features of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were investigated
for the implementation of a personal authentication system using a reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm. ECG signals were recorded from 11 subjects for 6 days. Consecutive 5-day datasets
(from the 1st to the 5th day) were trained, and the 6th dataset was tested. To search for the optimal
features of ECG for the authentication problem, RL was utilized as an optimizer, and its internal
model was designed based on deep learning structures. In addition, the deep learning architecture in
RL was automatically constructed based on an optimization approach called Bayesian optimization
hyperband. The experimental results demonstrate that the feature selection process is essential to
improve the authentication performance with fewer features to implement an efﬁcient system in
terms of computation power and energy consumption for a wearable device intended to be used as
an authentication system. Support vector machines in conjunction with the optimized RL algorithm
yielded accuracy outcomes using fewer features that were approximately 5%, 3.6%, and 2.6% higher
than those associated with information gain (IG), ReliefF, and pure reinforcement learning structures,
respectively. Additionally, the optimized RL yielded mostly lower equal error rate (EER) values than
the other feature selection algorithms, with fewer selected features."
104,4-Pole Tunable Absorptive Bandstop Filters Using Folded Coupled-Lines With an Inductor,"ABSTRACT
The ever-growing ﬁeld of wireless communication requires efﬁcient radio frequency
transceivers with tunable absorptive bandstop ﬁlters that can prevent the interference of out-of-band and
reﬂected signals. This paper presents 4-pole tunable absorptive bandstop ﬁlters using folded coupled-lines
with an inductor. A 4-pole ﬁlter transfer function is achieved to obtain an absorptive bandstop ﬁlter coupling
diagram with 45◦electrical-length transmission-line source/load coupling. The folded-loaded coupled-lines
with an inductor are proposed to obtain the control for the required coupling coefﬁcients based on the ﬁlter
transfer functions. The required quality factor extracted through the transfer function is accomplished using
a distributed resonator loaded with asymmetrical varactors without auxiliary circuits, such as an impedance-
matching network. Two types of ﬁlters were designed and built on a substrate with εr = 3.42 and h = 30 mil.
The center frequency tuning was performed using silicon varactors. The ﬁrst ﬁlter shows a return loss of
16.2–38 dB and a rejection level of 41–48 dB in the tuning range 0.83–"

Blood oxygen speed (SpO2) is an indicator of the 
normal presence or absence of the respiratory 
function. This is attracting the attention of 
researchers since it could monitor the patient 
conditions of the chronic pulmonary diseases and 
covid-19. Covid-19 patients have the symptom of the 
significant SpO2 drop. This study tries to develop an 
early and easy checkup system of the continuous SpO2 
using an RGB camera. Unlike the contact SpO2 
measurement using the conventional optical sensor on 
a fingertip, the remote SpO2 sensor system is 
proposed using the facial video stream. The facial 
images are trained for the convolutional neural 
networks to implement the non-contact SpO2 
estimation model, which is designed based on the 
architecture 
of 
the 
conventional

meaningful performance, it takes long to train the 
model and produce the inference during the testing 
process since there are numerous weights and they 
are less scalable to the multiple tasks. Therefore, we 
propose a quaternion-based convolutional neural 
network model to design a lighter model with similar 
or 
better 
performance 
compared 
with 
the 
conventional model in the real domain. To achieve 
this goal, we extend the original model to the 
quaternion 
domain. 
The 
experimental 
results 
demonstrate that the new model is lighter keeping 
the similar performance as that of the conventional 
model."
104,Restoration of Time-Series Medical Data with Diffusion Model,"Abstract 
Time series data could be incomplete due to a variety 
of reasons such as the errors in communications and 
sensor devices. This paper aims to restore the 
incomplete time-series medical data using the 
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). A 
DDPM is applied to restore the missing values based 
on the model trained using the original data without 
loss. The proposed diffusion model-based signal 
restoration approach was successful in restoring the 
incomplete electrocardiogram signals up to 50%."
104,Self-Optimizing Bluetooth Low Energy Networks for Industrial IoT Applications,"Abstract—This letter develops an efﬁcient self-optimizing
algorithm for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks in indus-
trial IoT (IIoT) applications. The ultra-dense nature of IIoT
applications implies that BLE networks are associated with a
high probability of packet collisions, increasing the data collection
latency. Determining the optimal packet transmission interval
that minimizes the data collection latency is very challenging
due to the non-linearity of this problem. We derive an analytic
solution by which to realize an optimal advertising interval in a
closed-form expression and prove its optimality and uniqueness.
Based on a simple closed-form solution, we develop a low-
complexity self-optimizing algorithm that minimizes the data col-
lection latency. Simulation results conﬁrm that the analytic results
are accurate and that the proposed algorithm autonomously
optimizes BLE networks."
104,Multitask Siamese Network for Remote Photoplethysmography and Respiration Estimation,"Abstract: Heart and respiration rates represent important vital signs for the assessment of a person’s
health condition. To estimate these vital signs accurately, we propose a multitask Siamese network
model (MTS) that combines the advantages of the Siamese network and the multitask learning
architecture. The MTS model was trained by the images of the cheek including nose and mouth and
forehead areas while sharing the same parameters between the Siamese networks, in order to extract
the features about the heart and respiratory information. The proposed model was constructed with
a small number of parameters and was able to yield a high vital-sign-prediction accuracy, comparable
to that obtained from the single-task learning model; furthermore, the proposed model outperformed
the conventional multitask learning model. As a result, we can simultaneously predict the heart and
respiratory signals with the MTS model, while the number of parameters was reduced by 16 times
with the mean average errors of heart and respiration rates being 2.84 and 4.2"
104,Deep Learning Approach for Detecting Work-Related Stress Using Multimodal Signals,"Abstract—Work-related stress causes serious negative
physiological and socioeconomic effects on employees.
Detecting stress levels in a timely manner is important for
appropriate stress management; therefore, this study pro-
poses a deep learning (DL) approach that accurately detects
work-related stress by using multimodal signals. We designed
a protocol that simulates stressful situations and recruited
24 subjects for the experiments. Then, we collected electro-
cardiogram (ECG), respiration (RESP), and video data. The
datasets were pre-processed and 10-s ECG and RESP signals
and a sequenceof facial features were fed into our deep neural
network. Sixty-eight facial landmarks’ coordinates were extracted, and facial textures were extracted from a pre-trained
network based on facial expression recognition. Each signal was processed by each of its network branch, and data
were fused at two different levels: 1) feature-level and 2) decision-level. The feature-level fusion that used RESP and
facial landmarks’ coordinates showed average accuracy of 73.3%, AUC of 0.822, and F1 score of 0.700 in two-level stress
classiﬁcation, and the feature-level fusion that used ECG, RESP, and the coordinates showed average accuracy of 54.4%,
AUC of 0.727, and F1 score of 0.508 in three-level stress classiﬁcation. When analyzing the weights in the decision-level
fusion, we found that the importance of each information item varied according to the stress classiﬁcation problem. When
comparing t-stochastic neighbor embedding results, we observed that overlapped samples of different classes caused
performance degradation in both classiﬁcations. Our ﬁndings suggest that the proposed DL approach fusing multimodal
and heterogeneous signals can enhance stress detection."
104,Automatic Sleep Scoring Using Intrinsic Mode Based on Interpretable Deep Neural Networks,"ABSTRACT
Sleep experts manually label sleep stages via polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose sleep
disorders. However, this process is time-consuming, requires a lot of labor from sleep experts, and makes
the participants uncomfortable with the attachment of multiple sensors. Thus, automatic sleep scoring
methods are essential for practical sleep monitoring in our daily lives. In this study, we propose an automatic
sleep scoring model based on intrinsic oscillations in a single channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.
We applied noise assisted bivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-BEMD) to extract the intrinsic mode
components and an attention mechanism in deep neural networks to provide weights to the components
depending on their signiﬁcance to sleep scoring. In particular, through the attention mechanism, we found
an interpretable model by examining the oscillations that correspond to speciﬁc sleep stages. Therefore,
we analyzed which frequency components are more weighted to a sleep stage than the others, when the model
classiﬁes sleep stages, and, as a result, conﬁrmed that the model assigns convincing weights to the frequency
components for each sleep stage. Additionally, the model consists of a one-dimensional convolutional neural
network (1D-CNN) to extract features of an epoch and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)
to learn the sequential information of the consecutive epochs. We evaluated proposed model using Fpz-Cz,
Pz-Oz, and F3-M2 channel EEG from three different public datasets (Sleep-EDF-2013, Sleep-EDF-2018,
WSC) and demonstrated that our model yielded the best overall accuracy (Fpz-Cz: 86.22%-82.67%, Pz-Oz:
83.63%-80.15%, F3-M2: 84.20%) and macro F1-score (Fpz-Cz: 80.79%-76.90%, Pz-Oz: 76.89%-72.98%,
F3-M2: 74.88%) compared with the state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithms using single channel EEG. As a
benchmark test, FIR bandpass ﬁlters were compared, and it was conﬁrmed that NA-BEMD was superior
to the traditional ﬁlters in all experiments, demonstrating that the proposed model is interpretable and a
state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithm."
104,Effect of a Recliner Chair with Rocking Motions on Sleep Efficiency,"Abstract: In this study, we analyze the effect of a recliner chair with rocking motions on sleep
quality of naps using automated sleep scoring and spindle detection models. The quality of sleep
corresponding to the two rocking motions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. For the
quantitative evaluation, we conducted a sleep parameter analysis based on the results of the estimated
sleep stages obtained on the brainwave and spindle estimation, and a sleep survey assessment from
the participants was analyzed for the qualitative evaluation. The analysis showed that sleep in the
recliner chair with rocking motions positively increased the duration of the spindles and deep sleep
stage, resulting in improved sleep quality."
104,Deep Learning-Based Optimal Smart Shoes Sensor Selection for Energy Expenditure and Heart Rate Estimation,"Abstract: Wearable technologies are known to improve our quality of life. Among the various
wearable devices, shoes are non-intrusive, lightweight, and can be used for outdoor activities. In this
study, we estimated the energy consumption and heart rate in an environment (i.e., running on a
treadmill) using smart shoes equipped with triaxial acceleration, triaxial gyroscope, and four-point
pressure sensors. The proposed model uses the latest deep learning architecture which does not
require any separate preprocessing. Moreover, it is possible to select the optimal sensor using a
channel-wise attention mechanism to weigh the sensors depending on their contributions to the
estimation of energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR). The performance of the proposed model
was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefﬁcient
of determination (R2). Moreover, the RMSE was"

57,No Title Found,"Abstract. Now a days multimedia application has increased in handheld  
devices and these applications needs a lot of power to operate. Power consump-
tion is an important issue in these handheld devices, the problem starts when 
user feels that a device is running out-of-power. Dynamic reconfiguration of 
mobile devices to optimize power according to user is an active area for  
research. Further the remote reconfiguration of mobile devices is feasible only 
when Request Processing Time i.e. time required in sending the request, proc-
essing at remote server, transmission of new bit stream to mobile device and  
reconfiguration of mobile device as per the requested quality (RqoS) must be 
less. This is achieved through the static optimizations which greatly reduce the 
processing and response time of the server. The results available during static 
analysis and preprocessing are reduced further with the help of the Huffman 
compression. This will not only reduce the run time analysis of the application 
but also helps in optimizing power."

107,Capacitive Toxic Gas Sensors Based on Oxide Composites: A Review,"Abstract—With the advancement of technology and our
pursuit of better living standards resulted a concerning
surge in pollutants from household, industry, automobile,
and numerous other sources. There are many hazardous
gases such as ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and
volatile organic compounds which gets formed and dissi-
pated mostly due to various human activity and sometimes
naturally. Detection of all these toxic gases is essential for
ensuring public health and safety. Oxide-based gas sen-
sors have undergone significant development, exhibiting
distinctive sensing properties, immense potential for diverse
applications, and the ability to operate at room temperature.
This article discusses the research and development of such
harmful gas detection based on capacitive sensors that are
composed of different metal oxides, metal oxide composites,
and nanostructures. Study focuses on the sensing ability and performance of these sensors in terms of sensitivity,
selectivity, and limit of detection. Furthermore, the mechanisms of gas sensing and their limitations in terms of improved
stability, sensitivity, faster response, and ease of detection in ambient environments have been discussed. In addition,
it provides an inclusive idea on future aspects of capacitive gas sensors and their potential applications in various fields."
107,Bias Potential Mediated NO&#x2082; Gas Sensor With NiCo&#x2082;O&#x2084; Hollow Micro-Spheres,"Abstract— A systematic gas sensing study of a litho-
graphically patterned metal interdigitated transducer and
popular spinel-compound i.e. NiCo2O4-based device (pre-
pared by spray dry process) was carried out with a variation
in bias potential (1 mV-1000 mV). The study shows that the
bias voltage influences various sensing parameters includ-
ing sensitivity, response, and recovery time, etc. of test
gas (NO2) at a fixed temperature (150◦C). This confirms that
only getting current levels in a measurable range shouldn’t
be the end of the experiment rather a complete analysis and
trade-off among sensing parameters need to be established
before selecting the final bias potential of a chemiresistive
device.

107,Arsenic Trioxide Nanostructures for Selective Detection of NO Gas at Room Temperature,"Abstract—Detection of nitric oxide (NO) is very important
as the permissible exposure limit is 25 ppm for 8 h. while
exposure at 100 ppm is immediately dangerous to life. How-
ever, its detection at a trace level is due to its existence as a
free radical rather than a molecule. In this article, we report
arsenic trioxide (As2O3) nanostructures prepared by pulver-
ization of arsenic in liquid media by subjecting it to ultrasonic
waves. The device has been found to be selective for NO
gas at room temperature efficiently. The device responded
in a range of 200 ppb–2.75 ppm of NO gas with reasonable
(7%–90%) response at room temperature with low hysteresis
(∼8%) with a linear sensitivity and fast response/recovery
time (<1 min). The insights on the interfacial interactions
between the As2O3 and NO gas molecules were also under-
stood based on the first principle density functional theory
calculations. This work will be crucial in designing and devel-
oping new selective receptors for the detection of toxic gases."
107,CMOS Based Temperature Sensing Via Change in Threshold Voltage,"Abstract— The design and simulation of MOS-based

MOSFETs in the sub-threshold range, the sensors 
exhibited extremely low power consumption. A diode-
connected NMOS is used as the sensing element, and an 
interfacing circuit is used for signal conditioning and 
amplification. The sensor operates at"
107,Non-Dispersive Infrared Gas Sensing Technology: A Review,"Abstract—Non-dispersive infrared gas sensing (NDIR) is a
unique optical sensing technique where IR radiation interacts
with the targeted analyte and in the process, it is absorbed.
This absorption is unique for every gas and hence, based on
the absorption characteristics, gas molecules can be ﬁnger-
printed and distinctively identiﬁed. A simple NDIR gas sensor
consists of an IR emitter, detector, optical ﬁlter, gas cell, and
circuit elements for signal processing. Further, these com-
ponents also offer choice for selection for example a micro-
electromechanical system (MEMS) based membrane heater,
a light-emittingdiode (LED), and IR lamp all have the capability
of generating IR spectra. Similarly, a pyroelectric detector,
photodiode, bolometer, as well as thermopile has the ability
to detect IR rays. The choice of the selection of components
carries advantages and disadvantages associated with them,
and thus it is very important to choose them correctly for the targeted applications. This article reviews the evolution of
non-dispersive infrared gas sensing techniques and the basic components of these sensors are discussed one-by-one.
Finally, the shortcomings of the NDIR gas sensor have been summarized and the efforts made in recent times to cope
with these are also discussed."
107,Effect of Ethyl Cellulose on Ammonia Sensing Abilities of Gas Sensors Fabricated Using MoS<sub>2</sub> Functional Ink for Printed Electronics Application,"Abstract—Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as an excellent alternative to metal oxide
and polymer-based conventional gas sensors. Liquid synthesis/processing of these materials has opened up doors for
developing printed gas sensors. However, the formulation of ink and tuning its rheology require some additives. Ethyl
cellulose (EC) has been consistently utilized for this purpose. In this letter, we have qualitatively assessed the role of
EC addition on the performance of gas sensors based on the MoS2 nanosheets. In the process, we ﬁrst optimized the
ultrasonication time to achieve an optimal gas sensing performance. Furthermore, we optimized centrifugation time since
it is an important parameter governing the printability of the ink. We further optimized the addition of EC in the solution
to formulate printable ink. Ammonia sensors based on MoS2 solutions with and without EC were developed, and their
performance has been compared at the assay of absolute response, baseline drift, response time, and recovery time. It is
clearly evident that the addition of EC not only affects the device baseline current levels but also deteriorates the absolute
response and minimum detection limit."
107,Ultra-Sonication Assisted Synthesis of 2D SnS<sub>2</sub> Nanoflakes for Room-Temperature No Gas Detection,"Abstract—Tin disulﬁde belongs to the class of layered
materials and has drawn attention because of its unique
surface properties. In this report, synthetically prepared bulk
precursor has been used to fabricate 2D layered hexagonal
SnS2 ﬂakes by using liquid exfoliation technique. It was
evident from structural and morphological characterization
that the exfoliation produces aggregated ﬂakes of SnS2. The
prepared 2D SnS2 based sensorhas shown a response toward
NO gas at room temperature, whereas the bulk SnS2 based
device doesn’t respond to any analyte. The device employing
exfoliated SnS2 ﬂakes as sensing layer responds to NO in
the concentration range of 500 ppb (20.61%) to 2.75 ppm
(163.32%). Moreover, the sensor offers highly stable and
repeatable performance with little drift. This study implements an efﬁcient route for nanoﬂakes synthesis from bulk
layered SnS2 by the liquid exfoliation and the result of sensing test can stimulate in the production of high performance
NO gas sensors."
107,Scalable Approach to Develop High Performance Chemiresistive Nitric Oxide Sensor,"Abstract—We report on a low cost and scalable approach to
develop a chemiresistive nitric oxide sensor based on iron oxide
nanorods sensing ﬁlm. The device was found to detect nitric oxide
(NO) gas at an optimal temperature of 250 °C. The device required
very low bias voltage (i.e., 1 mV) to operate and was sensitive to NO
gas in the concentration range 0.5 ppm–2.75 ppm. The response
of the device in this range found to be"
107,Ammonia Sensing Performance of RGO-Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensor Decorated With Exfoliated MoSe<sub>2</sub> Nanosheets,"Abstract—Chemiresistive ammonia gas sensor based on
Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is an excellent alternative
for developing low-cost chemiresistive ammonia gas sen-
sors. However, pure RGO based devices have several disad-
vantages associated with it such as the response of these
devices are very low and the response and recovery time
is signiﬁcantly high. In this work, we have demonstrated
that loading MoSe2 nanosheets on RGO sheets helps in
improving its ammonia sensing capabilities signiﬁcantly. The
RGO/MoSe2 nanocomposite showed limit of detection down
to 300 ppb, whereas, pure RGO based sensor couldn’t reliably
measure concentration below 1 ppm. The responsivity of
nanocomposite-based sensor was 2.6 times better compared
to pure RGO sensor. The sensor device could be operated at room temperature with an operating voltage of 2 mV,
which demonstrated ultra-low power consumption compared to other commercially available metal oxide Taguchi
sensors or electrochemical sensors. A sensing mechanism based on charge transfer is proposed to elucidate the better
performance for the device."
107,Development of a Ferrite Film Based Solid State Sensor System for Ultra Low Concentration Hydrogen Sulfide Gas Detection,"Abstract—We report on a selective hydrogen sulﬁde gas
sensor based on zinc ferrite ﬁlm which is obtained by
a microwave-assisted solvothermal deposition route. The
response of the chemiresistive device is found to be in the
range of 1872% - 90% for 5.6 ppm – 0.3 ppm of H2S gas at an
operating temperature of 250◦C. The density functional theory
studies suggest physisorption of the H2S molecules at the
partially-inverted ZnFe2O4 surface as the reason behind the
fast rise (of the order of ∼40 sec) and fall time (of the order of
∼70 sec) with complete recovery of the device. Finally, a dual-
differential subtractor based auto-balancing interface circuit
is proposed to drive this sensor which is advantageous in
terms of accuracy and particularly suitable for a device such
as ours, which has a wide dynamic range."
107,Giant Humidity Responsiveness of Platinum Functionalized WS<inf>2</inf> Nanosheet Based Chemiresistors,"Abstract— In this paper, WS2 nanosheets (NS) were prepared 
by the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) method, and the exfoliated 
WS2 NS were further functionalized with Pt-nanoparticles (NPs) 
via the wet chemical approach. The humidity sensing 
characteristics for both pristine WS2 NS as well as Pt-decorated 
WS2 NS were recorded at room temperature in moderate relative 
humidity (RH) range of 25%-55%. The Pt-decorated WS2 NS 
based sensors showed a very high response of 4.92 (at 25% RH) to 
35,852 (at 55% RH) which is about"
107,CVD Grown Cuprous Oxide Thin Film Based High Performance Chemiresistive Ammonia Gas Sensors,"Abstract—Cuprous Oxide (Cu2O) is an important p-type
semiconductor. Several micro and nano-structures of Cu2O have
been employed in sensing oxidizing and reducing gases. However,
for mass production of sensors, large-area Cu2O ﬁlms are needed,
which hitherto was a challenge. In this work we report a
chemiresistive gas sensor based on pure-phase Cu2O (∼90 nm
thick), synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). At an
operating temperature of 200◦C, the sensor is highly-sensitive to
ammonia. The device response varies from 0.81% to 5.21%, when
exposed to ammonia with concentration of 300 ppb to 3 ppm.
The response time (τresponse) and recovery time (τrecovery) of the
device were found to be decent for practical applications. Unlike
competing techniques for Cu2O deposition, Cu2O from chemical-
vapor deposition leads to sensors that are more repeatable, stable
and reproducible."
107,2D Nano Materials for CMOS compatible Gas Sensors,"Abstract—Among the 2D materials family, the Transition 
Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD) offer interesting opportunities 
for application in chemi-resistive gas sensors. Along with high 
surface to volume ratio, an ideal characteristic for surface 
adsorption driven gas sensing phenomenon, TMDs lend 
themselves for wide range of tunability of other important 
parameters such as bandgap and conductivity. In order to build 
CMOS compatible gas sensors for system-on-chip applications, 
it is also important to develop low temperature processes for the 
integration of sensing materials at the back end of the CMOS 
line. In this context liquid exfoliation of 2D TMD materials can 
be exploited for room temperature synthesis of sensing material 
on top of CMOS platform. We present high performance gas 
sensors realized using few layer WS2 and MoSe2 for NH3 and 
H2S gases respectively."
107,untitled,"Abstract—Vanadium Pentoxide (V2O5) nanosheets, liquid ex-
foliated in ethanol, were used as sensing material for hydrogen
sulﬁde (H2S) detection. The material properties such as mor-
phology, phase, chemical signature were characterized using Field
Emissionelectronmicroscopy(FESEM),Transmissionelectronmi-
croscopy (TEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray Diffrac-
tion (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron microscopy
(XPS). These nanosheets were further dropcasted on Ti/Pt inter-
digitated electrode (IDE) to fabricate a chemiresistive gas sensing
device. The sensors show excellent response towards H2S gas at an
operating temperature of 350 °C, when operated in 500 ppb–4 ppm
range. The response in this range was found to be varying linearly
from"
107,Tungsten Disulphide Nanosheets for High-Performance Chemiresistive Ammonia Gas Sensor,"Abstract—The sensing behavior of as-fabricated and annealed
WS2 nanosheets towards ammonia (NH3) gas has been demon-
strated in this study. The nanosheets were synthesized using
liquid-phase exfoliation technique and the effect of the sonication
time on gas sensing capability was assessed. It was observed that
sonication time affects the ammonia sensing performance and
samples sonicated for durations between 3-6 hours show good
sensing performance, with the ones sonicated for 5 hours report-
ing optimal performance. The sensing response towards ammonia
was demonstrated in the concentration range of 300 ppb (3.8%)
to 3 ppm (79.10%) at an optimized sensing temperature of
250◦C. These nanosheets were further annealed for two hours
in nitrogen ambient and this signiﬁcantly enhanced the response
by an order of magnitude for the highest ammonia concentration
of 3 ppm, i.e. from 79.1% to 1805%. The response and recovery
time of the device after annealing were found to be improved
in the concentration range of 0.4 ppm - 2 ppm of ammonia.
Though the linearity of the device response in high concentration
regime is affected by the annealing process, it enables the
sensor to push the lowest limit of detection down to 50 ppb.
The as-prepared nanosheets were characterized using different
material characterization tools and the results are reported here.
A plausible mechanism has also been proposed for this sensor
based on the detailed chemical composition analysis."
107,"Enhanced Gas Sensing Properties of Liquid-Processed Semiconducting Tungsten Chalcogenide (WX<sub>i</sub>, X &#x003D; O and S) Based Hybrid Nanomaterials","Abstract—A high temperature chemiresistive ammonia sensor
based on nanohybrids of semiconducting tungsten chalcogenides
i.e. tungsten oxides (WO3) and tungsten sulﬁdes (WS2) is
reported in this paper. The sensitivity of the devices was inves-
tigated over a wide range of concentration i.e. (250–2000 ppm)

107,Ppb-Level Ammonia Detection by Exfoliated WS<inf>2</inf> Based Chemiresistive Sensors for Breath Analysis,"Abstract— The sensing behavior of as-synthesized and 
annealed WS2 nanosheets towards Ammonia has been 
demonstrated in this study. The nanosheets were 
synthesized using liquid-phase exfoliation technique It was 
observed that sonication time affects the ammonia sensing 
performance and 3-6 hours sonicated samples showed 
good sensing performances with 5 hours sonicated sample 
showing 
optimal 
performance. 
The 
as-synthesized 
nanosheets 
based 
chemiresistive 
sensors 
showed 
reasonable 
response 
towards 
ammonia 
in 
the 
concentration range of 300 ppb (3.8%) to 3 ppm (79.10%) 
at an optimum temperature of 250oC. The response and 
recovery time were found to be 67 s and 87 s respectively. 
These samples were further annealed for two hours in 
itrogen ambient and this significantly enhanced the 
response by an order of magnitude for the highest 
concentration of 3 ppm, i.e. from 79.1% to 1805%. The 
response and recovery time were found to be 125 s and 59 
s. Though the linearity of the device response is affected by 
the annealing process, it enables the sensor to push the 
lowest limit of detection down to 50 ppb. A plausible 
mechanism has also been proposed for this sensor."
107,Humidity Sensing Properties of Coexfoliated Heterogeneous WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> Nanohybrids,"Abstract—Two-dimensional-layered Van der Waals nanostruc-
tures and their hybrids have been in focus since the discovery of
graphene. Transition metal dichalcogenides are an important seg-
ment of materials of this class which is analogous to graphene
and can be exfoliated to mono and few layers form. Excellent in-
terlayer coupling among these nanomaterials may result in fasci-
nating synergistic properties. In this work, a simple liquid-phase
coexfoliation technique was utilized to exfoliate WS2 and WSe2
simultaneously by an optimized mixed solvent strategy. The as-
synthesized nanohybrids were characterized by using different
material characterization techniques. The coexfoliated nanoma-
terial has shown excellent humidity sensing properties including
high reproducibility, stability, and low hysteresis. The response
from our humidity sensor varies between 15.4 (at 40% RH) to 57
times (at 80% RH), compared to the reference value of the air (at
∼25% RH). The response and recovery times were observed to be
40 and 65 s, respectively, for 60% RH. The performance of coexfo-
liated sensing layer was compared with individual WS2, and WSe2
nanosheets and nanocomposite prepared by exfoliation separately.
Better performance of sensors utilizing coexfoliated nanosheets
has been attributed to synergistic interfacial effects and high pro-
ton conductivity. A mechanism based on heterogeneous WS2/WSe2
nanohybrids has been proposed where the interfaces help in cre-
ating favorable sites for water adsorption and desorption apart
from the sulfur vacancies in the individual WS2 or WSe2. This has
been attributed to modulation of surface barrier potential through
interfacial electron transfer. We believe such sensing mechanism
can help in the development of a new generation highly sensitive
humidity sensor."
107,untitled,"Abstract—This paper reports humidity sensing performance of
WS2/GO hybrid nanostructures. WS2, being a layered material,
can be exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets. These nanosheets
when combined with other materials with lamellar structures
easily form hybrid structures even when processed in liquid.
Hybrid structures with materials like graphene oxide (GO) have
several advantages for humidity sensing like increase in defect
sites and oxygen rich groups, which ultimately enhance the
performance of humidity sensor. Interdigitated electrodes (made
of aluminum), fabricated using photolithography technique on
Si/SiO2 substrate, was used as sensor device platform. The
WS2/GO (in the wt% ratio of 1:3) sensing layer showed excellent
optimal response when exposed to different humidity levels. The
response achieved was 65.8 times at 40% relative humidity (RH)
and 590 times at 80% RH. The response time and recovery time
was also found to be good, e.g., only 25 and 29 s, respectively,
at 60% RH. The device showed repeatable results when exposed
to the same RH%. The stability of device was tested for over a
month and the response at each RH% have found to be the same
with its day-zero performance. A fast response combined with
excellent repeatability due to low hysteresis loss and high stabil-
ity (in the ambient) of the device makes it an excellent sensing
material. Overall, the performance of WS2/GO nanohybrid-based
humidity sensors seems to be comparable to other established
sensing nanomaterials used in solid state humidity sensors."
108,The Vibration Spectrograms as well as EL System for Assessing the Cutting Tool and Insert Condition,"Abstract—In-process damage to cutting instruments can 
result in surface deterioration, leading to substantial financial 
losses. Detecting potential failures before they escalate to critical 
stages is vital, making Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) 
indispensable. Previous research has predominantly focused on 
Machine Learning (ML)-based TCM, particularly Deep 
Learning (DL). To enhance the resilience of TCM frameworks 
in noisy cross-domain machining environments, a deeper 
understanding of deep neural networks, their hierarchical 
compositionality, and distributed modeling is necessary. This 
study delves into these intricacies and proposes an innovative 
approach 
using 
Ensemble 
Learning, 
combining 
CNN 
architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, LeNet, Stand-5, and 
VGG-16. These architectures are applied to monitor real-time 
spindle vibrations associated with diverse milling cutter 
configurations, including both healthy and defective states. The 
collected data, transformed into time and frequency domains, 
was 
processed
using 
graphical 
techniques, 
specifically 
spectrograms. 
The 
Ensemble 
Learning 
algorithm 
was 
meticulously trained, rigorously tested, and validated with 
diverse datasets, demonstrating promising results. This 
approach marks a significant advancement in creating a robust 
TCM framework capable of effectively identifying and 
mitigating damage in cutting instruments within complex 
machining environments."

An investigation of the electrical characteristics of banana leaf reinforced Polymer 
composites made by resin transfer molding (RTM) has been carried out, with special 
emphasis on the effects of fibre loading, frequency and temperature. Every parameter, 
including the dielectric constant (ɛ0), dissipation factor (tan δ), loss factor (ɛ00), and 
conductivity, increases with increasing fibre concentration over the whole frequency range. A 
minimum fibre content of 50 % is required for composites to achieve excellent performance 
values. This increase is large at low frequencies, minimal at middle frequencies, and 
negligible at extremely high frequencies, according to the results of the study. At low 
frequencies, the volume resistivity fluctuates in response to fibre loading, while at high 
frequencies, the resistivity blends together. When the temperature rises, the dielectric 
constant values rise as well, however once the glass transition temperature is reached, the 
dielectric constant values fall. This fluctuates depending on the amount of fibre present. 
Finally, an attempt is made to establish a relationship between the experimental value of the 
dielectric constant and theoretical expectations."
108,Remote Patient Activity Monitoring System by Integrating IoT Sensors and Artificial Intelligence Techniques,"Abstract: Even with the most cutting-edge tools, treating and monitoring patients—including chil-
dren, elders, and suspected COVID-19 patients—remains a challenging activity. This study aimed
to track multiple COVID-19-related vital indicators using a wearable monitoring device with an
Internet of Things (IOT) focus. Additionally, the technology automatically alerts the appropriate
medical authorities about any breaches of conﬁnement for potentially contagious patients by tracking
patients’ real-time GPS data. The wearable sensor is connected to a network edge in the Internet
of Things cloud, where data are processed and analyzed to ascertain the state of body function.
The proposed system is built with three tiers of functionalities: a cloud layer using an Application
Peripheral Interface (API) for mobile devices, a layer of wearable IOT sensors, and a layer of Android
web for mobile devices. Each layer performs a certain purpose. Data from the IoT perception layer are
initially collected in order to identify the ailments. The following layer is used to store the information
in the cloud database for preventative actions, notiﬁcations, and quick reactions. The Android mobile
application layer notiﬁes and alerts the families of the potentially impacted patients. In order to
recognize human activities, this work suggests a novel integrated deep neural network model called
CNN-UUGRU which mixes convolutional and updated gated recurrent subunits. The efﬁciency
of this model, which was successfully evaluated on the Kaggle dataset, is signiﬁcantly higher than
that of other cutting-edge deep neural models and it surpassed existing products in local and public
datasets, achieving accuracy of 97.7%, precision of 96.8%, and an F-measure of 97.75%."

Recently, the use of different social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp 
have increased significantly. A vast number of static images and motion frame pictures posted on 
such platforms get stored in the device folder making it critical to identify the social network of 
the downloaded images in the android domain. This is a multimedia forensic job with major cyber 
security consequences and is said to be accomplished using unique traces contained in picture 
material (SNs). Therefore, this proposal has been endeavoured to construct a new framework 
called FusionNet to combine two well-established single shared Convolutional Neural Networks

accuracy. Image searching is one of the challenging issues in the android domain besides being a 
time-consuming process. The goal of the proposed network's architecture and training is to 
enhance the forensic information included in the digital pictures shared on social media. 
Furthermore, several network designs for the categorization of WhatsApp pictures have been 
compared and this suggested method has shown better performance in the comparison. The 
proposed framework's overall performance was measured using the performance metrics.

108,International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,"Abstract—Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) might be a problematic assignment for tumor fluctuation and complexity because of brain 
image classification. This work presents the brain tumor classification system using Convolutional Gated Recurrent Neural Network (CGRNN) 
algorithm based on MRI images. The proposed tumor recognition framework comprises of four stages, to be specific preprocessing, feature 
extraction, segmentation and classification. Extraction of identified tumor framework features was accomplished utilizing Gray Level Co-
occurrence Matrix (GLCM) strategy. At long last, the Convolutional Gated Recurrent Neural Network Classifier has been created to perceive 
various kinds of brain disease. The proposed framework can be effective in grouping these models and reacting to any variation from the 
abnormality. The entire framework is isolated into different types of phases: the Learning/Training Phase and the Recognition/Test Phase. A 
CGRNN classifier under the scholarly ideal separation measurements is utilized to decide the chance of every pixel having a place with the 
foreground (tumor) and the background. MATLAB software is used in the development of the simulation of the proposed system. The suggested 
method's simulation results show that the analysis of brain tumours is stable. It shows that the proposed brain tumor classifications are superior 
to those from brain MRIs than existing brain tumor classifications. The overall accuracy of the proposed system is 98.45%."

community. The existing broadband users are overcrowded, and its faster speed has now become
an essential parameter to meet the consumer’s expectations in the growing technology. As a
result of our growth in computer technologies, high-speed processors are necessary, which pro-
vide simultaneous data computing with lower costs and a performance of more than 10,000 times
quicker than electrical computers. Optics has become a more feasible alternative to electronics
because of its greater speed. In this study, various methods of photonic crystals (PhCs) have been
thoroughly examined, with essential properties and their benefits explained over previously iden-
tified methods (semiconductor optical amplifier and nonlinear waveguides) utilized to construct
all-optical logic circuits. Particularly, evaluated a number of articles that covered topics including
self-collimation effects, PhC waveguide intersection, and multi-mode interference with non-
linear effects. The merits and demerits of each technology are analyzed. Finally, concluded the
major difficulties and the potential usage of every method. PhCs are used in logic circuits and
devices for high data transmission. The performances of different types of logic gates based on
PhC are studied. © 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10.1117/"
108,Geographic Drone-based Route Optimization Approach for Emergency Area Ad-Hoc Network,"Abstract: Wireless sensor Mobile ad hoc networks have excellent potential in
moving and monitoring disaster area networks on real-time basis. The recent chal-
lenges faced in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) include scalability, locali-
zation, heterogeneous network, self-organization, and self-sufﬁcient operation.
In this background, the current study focuses on specially-designed communica-
tion link establishment for high connection stability of wireless mobile sensor
networks, especially in disaster area network. Existing protocols focus on
location-dependent communications and use networks based on typically-used
Internet Protocol (IP) architecture. However, IP-based communications have a
few limitations such as inefﬁcient bandwidth utilization, high processing, less
transfer speeds, and excessive memory intake. To overcome these challenges,
the number of neighbors (Node Density) is minimized and high Mobility Nodes
(Node Speed) are avoided. The proposed Geographic Drone Based Route Optimi-
zation (GDRO) method reduces the entire overhead to a considerable level in
an efﬁcient manner and signiﬁcantly improves the overall performance by identi-
fying the disaster region. This drone communicates with anchor node periodically
and shares the information to it so as to introduce a drone-based disaster network
in an area. Geographic routing is a promising approach to enhance the routing
efﬁciency in MANET. This algorithm helps in reaching the anchor (target) node
with the help of Geographical Graph-Based Mapping (GGM). Global Positioning
System (GPS) is enabled on mobile network of the anchor node which regularly
broadcasts its location information that helps in ﬁnding the location. In ﬁrst step,
the node searches for local and remote anticipated Expected Transmission Count
(ETX), thereby calculating the estimated distance. Received Signal Strength Indi-
cator (RSSI) results are stored in the local memory of the node. Then, the node
calculates the least remote anticipated ETX, Link Loss Rate, and information to
the new location. Freeway Heuristic algorithm improves the data speed, efﬁciency
and determines the path and optimization problem. In comparison with other
models, the proposed method yielded an efﬁcient communication, increased the
throughput, and reduced the end-to-end delay, energy consumption and packet
loss performance in disaster area networks.

108,Deep Fusion Cnn Based Hybridized Strategy for Image Retrieval in Web: A ,"Abstract 
There is always a need for an efficient and effective Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) 
classification due to the constant development in the number of large-scale repository. During the last few 
years, there has been a tremendous increase in activity in using multimedia data including both scientific 
and commercial domains. As a result, it's necessary to organize, store, analyze, and present available facts 
that meet user needs. Visual components are used in CBIR to find a picture from a large image document 
based on the user's interest and instantaneously query sequence attributes. The term 'content' may relate to 
the image's low-level properties such as color, form, or material. The need for CBIR arises because most 
image retrieval algorithms rely solely on textual information, resulting in a lot of garbage in the outcomes.

Abstract 
Air pollution poses significant threats to ecosystems, 
atmosphere, and the health of both humans and wildlife. 
It is primarily caused by industrial and chemical pollutants, 
leading to deterioration in air, water, and soil quality. As a 
result, effective air quality monitoring is crucial for 
environmental management. Flying Mobile Ad hoc 
Networks (FMANETs) offer a promising solution for 
intelligent air quality monitoring and assessment by 
employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to measure 
air pollutants. However, FMANET-based systems face 
unique challenges, including UAVs' three-dimensional 
movement, high dynamism, rapid topological changes, 
resource constraints, and low UAV density. Therefore, 
routing optimization becomes a fundamental issue in 
these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel routing 
method named RFMAN (Reward-learning-based FMANET) 
for intelligent air quality monitoring systems. RFMAN 
consists of two main components: route discovery and 
route maintenance. In the route discovery phase, we 
introduce a Reward-learning-based mechanism to identify 
optimal routes, while also implementing a filtering 
parameter to refine the UAV selection process and reduce 
the search space. The route maintenance phase of RFMAN 
focuses on detecting and correcting paths nearing 
breakdowns, as well as promptly replacing failed paths to 
ensure continuous monitoring efficiency. The result 
section pictures that RFMAN outperforms other methods. 
The training dataset consists of 81,334 samples with the 
distribution: 57.2% for 1-AQIs, 16.2% for 2-AQIs, 10.7% for 
3-AQIs, 7.8% for 4-AQIs, 7.8% for 5-AQIs, and 6.5% for 6-
AQIs. The testing dataset consists of 13,432 samples with 
the distribution: 54.9% for 1-AQIs, 17.8% for 2-AQIs, 
12.1% for 3-AQIs, 8.0% for 4-AQIs, 6.7% for 5-AQIs, and 
5.6% for 6-AQIs. Overall, RFMAN offers a promising 
solution for enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of 
air quality monitoring in FMANET-based systems."
108,Mobility Aware Quality Enhanced Cluster Based Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks Using Hybrid Optimization Algorithm,"Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) utilizes more nodes to forward messages and informa-
tion from source node to destination node and these nodes are battery-powered devices. 
Thus, Energy saving is always vital role of Routing Protocols which need to maximize the 
lifetime of WSN. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) are self-starting and self-construct-
ing multichip wireless networks in which, the assembly of the system deviates vigorously. 
This is mainly due to the mobility of the nodes. The nodes in the network not only act as 
hosts but also as routers that route data from other nodes in network. MANETs require 
an efficient routing protocol that achieves the quality of service (QoS) mechanism. They 
are not considering the mobility as one constraint for those problems. Because, mobility 
of nodes causes frequent link failures and high error rates, so it makes difficult to main-
tain the desired QoS in the network. To overcome those problems, we propose mobility 
aware routing protocol for MANET using hybrid optimization (MARP-HO) algorithm, 
which maximizes the QoS in data transmission. The proposed routing protocol comprises 
of two phases. The clustering process consists of cluster formation and cluster head (CH) 
selection. First, the energy efficient clustering is done by improved animal migration opti-
mization (IAMO) algorithm. Then, we gather multiple constraints are energy consump-
tion, received signal strength, mobility and cooperative rate from each cluster member. The 
gathered constraints used to compute the node cost of each cluster member, here the high-
est cost node act as CH of cluster. Second, we compute routing path between source–des-
tination using improved ant colony optimization (IACO) algorithm. The proposed MARP-
HO routing protocol is compared with existing state-of-art routing protocols in terms of 
energy consumption, delivery ratio, loss ratio, link stability, delay, network lifetime, num-
ber of dead nodes and throughput."

Every year more and more people are afflicted with brain tumours. An improper proliferation 
of the cells is responsible for the tumours. Brain tumours may be benign or malignant (non-
cancerous tumours or cancerous). They also include major and secondary categories. In the 
brain or the central nervous systems, primary tumours develop, while the secondary tumours 
move from other areas of the body into the brain. The tumours are typecast to four degrees, 
depending upon the degree of abnormalities of the brain tissue. Tumors grade 1 and 2 are less 
harmful at low grades. Tumors of 3 and 4 degrees are high-quality cancer-prone tumours. 
Segmentation of pictures using clustering algorithms such as k-means, C-means, etc. produces 
advantageous image characteristics. In analysis and interpretation of pictures, image 
segmentation plays a vital role. This article is intended to use MRI scans to diagnose the brain 
tumour. The diagnostic procedure is made possible by CNN models, one of the deep learning 
networks. The architecture resnet50 is used as a foundation, one of the CNN models. The 
findings of this work have shown that transmission learning may be utilised for the 
segmentation and categorization of the tumours. We utilised transfer learning to categorise 
various forms of tumour in this work while categorising it into distinct categories of glioma 
tumour. This investigation also employed segmentation and classification because the tumour 
levels are largely tumor-dependent."

The cloud computing is an outstanding service-oriented dissemination with voluminous computation 
assessment and information storage over the linked transmission medium. It communicates the 
irresistible technology driving the internet-based technology where the users could effortlessly 
distribute the confidential information for improved assessment and extortion. Moreover, the user-
friendly cloud computing services allow the utilization of various applications reasonably. 
Temporarily effortless information distribution forces diverse confidentiality threats and malware-
driven safety risks. Various confidentiality aware applications such as healthcare services over the 
cloud are created with various inexpensive and processing advantages with the need for improving 
safety. Therefore complete cybersecurity and improvement against threats are necessary to 
safeguard the comprehensive information confidentiality. Normally various application-based 
information sets are anonymized with improved confidentiality to the creators without offering all 
the confidentiality prerequisites to the freshly appended information. Few modelled schemes drive 
the problems by re – anonymizing the information sets from the nick. Increased confidentiality 
safeguarding over iterative information sets over cloud computing is accomplished. Precisely the 
broadcasting of immense information sets over different storage nodes restricts the confidentiality

108,Modelling LSUTE: PKE Schemes for Safeguarding Electronic Healthcare Records Over Cloud Communication Environment,"Abstract
Presently offering safety to the information stored in a cloud environment is a crucial 
and demanding process. For fulfilling various confidentiality safeguarding and encoding 
schemes several schemes are modelled but they comprise setbacks such as increased cost, 
increased time and poor safety levels. For addressing the setbacks the goal is to model a 
fresh scheme termed as layer screened unsigned tree based encoding (LSUTE) and posi-
tion based keyword enquiry for offering confidentiality to the information stored into the 
cloud environment. Here the confidentiality is offered to the healthcare-related information 
uploaded into the electronic healthcare comprising two components for safeguarding the 
information storage and position based keyword exploration. Initially, the healthcare docu-
ments from the physician and lab technicians are stored in an encoded manner employing 
the modelled LSUTE scheme where only the trusted and verified individual can make use 
of the healthcare reports. Followed by which the position based exploration is performed 
based on the keyword and queries. A method based on decision trees is proposed to selec-
tively decide whether to test all inter modes. The key merit is offering improved confiden-
tiality to the healthcare information in a safe manner. The outcomes of the analyses reveal 
that the performance of the modelled schemes in terms of assessment cost, transmission 
cost, assessing queries, time of encoding, time of decoding and query reply time with neg-
ligible impact on coding efficiency. Therefore, algorithm to reduce the encoder run time 
with limited effects on the standard coding efficiency is implemented."
108,An efficient approach for brain tumor detection and segmentation in MR brain images using random forest classifier,"Abstract
Nowadays, the most demanding and time consuming task in medical image processing is Brain tumor segmentation and
detection. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is employed for creating a picture of any part in a body. MRI provides a
competent quick manner for analyzing tumor in the brain. This proposed framework contains different stages for classi-
fying tumor like Preprocessing, Feature extraction, Classification, and Segmentation. Initially, T1-weighted magnetic reso-
nance brain images are considered as an input for computational purpose. Median filter is proposed to optimize the skull
stripping in MRI images. Abnormal brain tissues are extracted in low contrast, in addition to meticulous location of edges
of affected tissue can be detected. Then, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HOG) are performing feature extraction process. HOG is used for extracting the features like texture and shape.
Then, Classification is performed through Machine learning categorization techniques via Random Forest Classifier
(RFC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). These classifiers classify the brain image as either nor-
mal or abnormal and the performance is analyzed by various parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy."

Recently, Virtual rehabilitation has recently emerged as a contemporary option to treating 
chronic, handicapped, or mobility-impaired patients using virtual reality, augmented reality, 
and motion capture technology. Using a virtual environment, patients are able to work out in 
accordance with their treatment plan. This study provides a PoseNet-based in-home 
rehabilitation telemedicine system with integrated statistical computation allowing clinicians 
to assess a patient's recovery progress. Using a smartphone camera, patients may undertake 
rehabilitation activities at home. The angular motions of the patients' elbows and knees are 
detected and tracked using the PoseNet skeleton-tracking technology. The estimated elbow 
and other feature poses are recorded during the completion process of rehabilitation activities 
in front of the mobile camera. Finally, additional performance measurements are gathered

109,"CNN Based Method for Multi -Type Diseased Arecanut Image Classification , pp., 255 -265 ","ABSTRACT 
 
Arecanut image classification is a challenging task to the researchers and in this paper a new combined approach of 
multi-gradient images and deep convolutional neural networks for multi-type arecanut image classification is presented. 
To enhance the fine details in arecanut images affected by different diseases, namely, rot, split and rot-split, we propose 
to explore multiple-Sobel masks for convolving with the input image. Although, the images suffer from distortion due to 
disease infection, this masking operation helps to enhance the fine details. We believe that the fine details provide vital 
clues for classification of normal, rot, split and rot-split images. To extract such clues, we explore the combination of 
multi-gradient and AlexNet by feeding enhanced images as input. Implementation results on the four-class dataset indicate 
that the approach proposed is superior in terms of classification rate, recall, precision and F-measures. The same 
conclusion can be drawn from the results of comparative study of proposed method with the existing methods."
109,Tchebichef Transform Domain-Based Deep Learning Architecture for Image Super-Resolution,"Abstract—Recent advances in the area of artiﬁcial intelligence
and deep learning have motivated researchers to apply this
knowledge to solve multipurpose applications in the area of
computer vision and image processing. Super-resolution (SR),
in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep
learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn
the nonlinear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their
corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling
results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this article,
we propose a deep learning-based image SR architecture in the
Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating
a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a
customized Tchebichef convolutional layer (TCL). The role of
TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the
orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions.
The inversion of the transform mentioned earlier is achieved
using another layer known as the inverse TCL (ITCL), which
converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the
spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef
transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of
high and low- frequency representation of images that makes
the task of SR simpliﬁed. Furthermore, a transfer learning-
based approach is adopted to enhance the quality of images by
considering Covid19 medical images as an additional experiment.
It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray
and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality
that may help in clinical diagnosis. Experimental results obtained
using the proposed Tchebichef transform domain SR (TTDSR)
architecture provides competitive results when compared with
most of the deep learning methods employed using a fewer
number of trainable parameters.

109,Multi‐gradient‐direction based deep learning model for arecanut disease identification,"Abstract
Arecanut disease identification is a challenging problem in the field of image processing.
In this work, we present a new combination of multi‐gradient‐direction and deep con-
volutional neural networks for arecanut disease identification, namely, rot, split and rot‐
split. Due to the effect of the disease, there are chances of losing vital details in the
images. To enhance the fine details in the images affected by diseases, we explore multi‐
Sobel directional masks for convolving with the input image, which results in enhanced
images. The proposed method extracts arecanut as foreground from the enhanced images
using Otsu thresholding. Further, the features are extracted for foreground information
for disease identification by exploring the ResNet architecture. The advantage of the
proposed approach is that it identifies the diseased images from the healthy arecanut
images. Experimental results on the dataset of four classes (healthy, rot, split and rot‐split)
show that the proposed model is superior in terms of classification rate.

109,Malware Classification Through Attention Residual Network based Visualization,"Abstract—With the exponential growth of malware variants
nowadays, malware detection poses to be an active ﬁeld of
research related to computer security. Traditional methods of
malware detection and classiﬁcation such as static program
analysis and dynamic execution analysis, usually combined with
machine learning, are restricted due to difﬁculties of reverse–
engineering the program executables, real–time execution trace
collection, and manual construction of effective feature sets.
Malware classiﬁcation based on representation of the binary
executables as images, followed by advanced machine learning
techniques such as deep learning, has been explored to over-
come these shortcomings. In this work, we propose a malware
classiﬁcation technique based on malware visualization using an
Attention Residual Network (a specialized convolutional neural
network), with RGB and grayscale image representations of the
malware program binaries. Experimental results for two common
malware datasets establish the effectiveness of the proposed
neural network in malware classiﬁcation, even when trained with
imbalanced datasets."
109,Weighted-Gradient Features for Handwritten Line Segmentation,"Abstract—Text 
line 
segmentation 
from 
handwritten 
documents is challenging when a document image contains severe 
touching. In this paper, we propose a new idea based on Weighted-
Gradient Features (WGF) for segmenting text lines. The proposed 
method finds the number of zero crossing points for every row of 
Canny edge image of the input one, which is considered as the 
weights of respective rows. The weights are then multiplied with 
gradient values of respective rows of the image to widen the gap 
between pixels in the middle portion of text and the other portions. 
Next, k-means clustering is performed on WGF to classify middle 
and other pixels of text. The method performs morphological 
operation to obtain word components as patches for the result of 
clustering. The patches in both the clusters are matched to find 
common patch areas, which helps in reducing touching effect. 
Then the proposed method checks linearity and non-linearity 
iteratively based on patch direction to segment text lines.  The 
method is tested on our own and standard datasets, namely, Alaei, 
ICDAR 2013 robust competition on handwriting context and 
ICDAR 2015-HTR, to evaluate the performance. Further, the 
method is compared with the state of art methods to show its 
effectiveness and usefulness."
109,New Fuzzy-Mass Based Features for Video Image Type Categorization,"Abstract— Due to the large variety of video type collections, it 
becomes difficult to achieve good text detection and recognition 
accuracy. We propose a new fuzzy-mass based method for 
classifying (categorizing) text frames from different types of video. 
For each frame of a video type, we formulate Fuzzy logic to 
identify straight and curved edge components from edge images. 
We then estimate mass locally and globally by drawing 
consecutive ellipses over edge images with respect to straight and 
curved edge components. Further, we extract features based on 
spatial proximity between centroid of classified straight/curved 
edge components and that of the whole image. This results local 
features. Next, the features are extracted for the whole image 
without ellipse drawing, which results in global features. The 
combination of both local and global features is then fed to an 
SVM classifier for video type classification. Experimental results 
on the proposed and existing classification methods show that the 
proposed classification outperforms the stat of art methods. 
Furthermore, experiments on before and after classification with 
several text detection and binarization methods show that the 
proposed classification is significant in improving text detection 
and recognition performance."
109,1,"Abstract—Image dehazing has become one of the crucial
preprocessing steps for any computer vision task. Most of the
dehazing methods try to estimate the transmission map along
with the atmospheric light to get the dehazed image in the image
domain. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture
that directly estimates dehazed image in Krawtchouk transform
domain. For this a customized Krawtchouk Convolution Layer
(KCL) in the architecture is added. KCL is constructed using
Krawtchouk basis functions which converts the image from the
spatial domain to the Krawtchouk transform domain. Another
convolution layer is added at the end of the architecture named as
Inverse Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (IKCL) which converts
the image back to the spatial domain from the transform domain.
It has been observed that the haze is mainly present in lower
frequencies of hazy images, wherein the Krawtchouk transform
helps to analyze the high and low frequencies of the images
separately. We have divided our architecture into two branches,
the upper branch deals with the higher frequencies while the
lower branch deals with the lower frequencies of the image.
The lower branch is made deeper in terms of the layers as
compared to the upper branch to address the haze present in
the lower frequencies. Using the proposed Orthogonal Transform
based Generative Adversarial Network (OTGAN) architecture
for image dehazing, we were able to achieve competitive results
when compared to the present state-of-the-art methods.

109,Arbitrarily-oriented multi-lingual text detection in video,"Abstract Text detection in arbitrarily-oriented multi-lingual video is an emerging area of
research because it plays a vital role for developing real-time indexing and retrieval systems. In
this paper, we propose to explore moments for identifying text candidates. We introduce a
novel idea for determining automatic windows to extract moments for tackling multi-font and
multi-sized text in video based on stroke width information. The temporal information is
explored to find deviations between moving and non-moving pixels in successive frames
iteratively, which results in static clusters containing caption text and dynamic clusters
containing scene text, as well as background pixels. The gradient directions of pixels in static
and dynamic clusters are analyzed to identify the potential text candidates. Furthermore,
boundary growing is proposed that expands the boundary of potential text candidates until it
finds neighbor components based on the nearest neighbor criterion. This process outputs text
lines appearing in the video. Experimental results on standard video data, namely, ICDAR
2013, ICDAR 2015, YVT videos and on our own English and Multi-lingual videos demon-
strate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

109,A quad tree based method for blurred and non-blurred video text frames classification through quality metrics,"Abstract—Blur is a common artifact in video, which adds more 
complexity to text detection and recognition. To achieve good 
accuracies for text detection and recognition, this paper suggests a 
new method for classifying blurred and non-blurred frames in 
video. We explore quality metrics, namely, BRISQUE, NRIQA, 
GPC and SI, in a new way for classification. We estimate the values 
of these metrics with the help of predefined samples called 
reference values. To widen the difference between metric values 
for better classification, we introduce scaling factors as a non-
linear sigmoidal function, which considers the metric of each 
current frame and its reference and results in templates. Based on 
the characteristics of metrics, the proposed method finds a 
relationship between the metrics to derive rules for classification. 
To classify the frame containing local blur, we explore quad tree 
division with classification rules which divide non-blurred blocks 
to identify local blur. We use standard databases, namely, ICDAR 
2013, ICDAR 2015 and YVT videos for experimentation, and 
evaluate the proposed method in terms of text detection and 
recognition rates given by text detection and binarization methods 
before and after classification."
109,DETECTION OF MULTI -ORIENTED MOVING TEXT ,"ABSTRACT 
Text, as one of the most significant creations of humankind, has played a vital part 
in humanoid life, so far from olden periods. High level semantics embodied in the text 
are beneficial in a wide range of vision-based applications. For example, image 
understanding, image indexing, geo location, automatic navigation, license plate 
recognition, assisting blind person and other surveillance applications. There are 
approaches in the field of content based image retrieval to solve the above mentioned 
problems. However, these approaches are inadequate to generate annotation based on 
semantics according to content of video or images due to opening between high level 
and low level features. Therefore text detection and recognition in videos grow into 
active and important research areas in computer vision and document analysis, which is 
capable of understanding the content of video and images at high level with the help of 
Optical Character Recognizer (OCR). Especially in recent years, the researchers has 
seen a flow of research efforts and considerable developments in these fields, however 
many challenges e.g. low resolution, complex background and variations in colors, 
font, font size, Multi-orientations, Multi-orientation text movements, noise, blur, and 
distortion still remain. The objectives of this work are in four folds: (1) to introduce a 
new descriptor called Histogram Oriented Moments (HOM) for detecting multi-
oriented text from videos. The HOM is created by considering the orientations 
calculated with the second order geometrical moments. Further, to verify the detected 
text, optical flow properties are used to estimate the motion between text candidates in 
temporal frames. However, the use of temporal information is limited to false positive 
elimination but not as main features to find text candidates.  (2) to propose new models 
for finding multi-oriented moving text from video and scene images through moments, 
motion vectors are utilized to identify moving regions that have constant velocity. 
However, the model is slightly sensitive to window size used for moment‟s calculation

and different scripts in video.  (3) To develop automatic window size determination for 
detecting text from videos, the next method explored stroke width transform based on 
the information that the stroke width remains constant throughout the characters. 
Further, the temporal frames are used for identifying text candidates based on the fact 
that caption text stays at the same unchanged location for few frames. However, the 
performance of the proposed method degrades when there is blur present in the video 
frames because moments and stroke width transforms are sensitive to blur. (4) To 
develop a method for text detection and recognition in blur frames, a blind 
deconvolution model is introduced that enhances the edge sharpness by suppressing 
blurred pixels. In summary, each work has been tested over benchmark datasets and 
authors‟ created datasets from different resources using standard measures. 
Furthermore, the results of the proposed methods are compared with the state of art 
methods to show that the proposed methods are competent to existing methods.

ABSTRAK 
Teks, sebagai salah satu ciptaan yang paling unggul daripada manusia, telah 
memainkan peranan yang penting dalam kehidupan harian, sejak zaman dulu. Semantik 
bertahap tinggi yang terkandung dalam teks dapat digunakan dalam pelbagai aplikasi 
berasaskan penglihatan. Sebagai contoh, pengertian imej, pengindeksan imej, lokasi 
geo, navigasi automatik, pengecaman tempat letak lesen, pertolongan kepada orang 
buta dan aplikasi-aplikasi pengawasan lain. Terdapat pelbagai kaedah yang berkenaan 
dengan pengembalian imej berasaskan kandung (CBIR) untuk menyelesaikan masalah-
masalah tersebut. Walau bagaimanapun, kaedah sebegini adalah tidak mencukupi untuk 
menjana nota penjelasan yang berasaskan semantik yang mengikut kandungan video 
atau imej. Ini adalah kerana terdapat jurang besar antara ciri-ciri tahap rendah dan 
tinggi. Oleh itu pengesanan dan pengecaman teks dalam video telah berkembang ke 
bidang-bidang visi computer dan analisa dokumen yang penting dan aktif, iaitu 
pemahaman kandungan video dan imej pada tahap yang tinggi dengan bantuan 
Pengecam Aksara Optik (OCR). Pada tahun-tahun kebelakangan ini, para penyelidik 
telah menyaksikan usaha-usaha penyelidikan dan perkembangan yang besar dalam 
bidang ini, namun pelbagai cabaran seperti resolusi rendah, latar belakang yang 
kompleks dan penukaran warna, perkataan, saiz perkataan, orientasi majmuk, 
pergerakan teks dalam orientasi majmuk, hingar, kabur, dan herotan, masih kekal. 
Terdapat empat objektif dalam kajian ini: (1) untuk memperkenalkan penghurai baru 
yang dikenali sebagai momen berasaskan histogram (HOM) untuk mengesan teks 
berorientasikan majmuk dari video. HOM direka cipta dengan mengambil kira orientasi 
yang dikira dengan momen geometri peringkat kedua. Selanjutnya, untuk mengesahkan 
teks yang dikesan, ciri-ciri aliran optik, telah digunakan untuk menganggarkan

109,A new sharpness based approach for character segmentation in License plate images,"Abstract 
 
Character segmentation from License plate is challenging 
as it suffers from non-uniform illumination, blur and 
touching adjacent character due to head light of vehicles 
effect etc. This paper presents a new approach based on 
sharpness of character and the space regions for 
segmentation. We explore Gradient Vector Flow Opposite 
Direction Pair of pixels for seed point’s selection. From 
the seed points, the proposed approach detects probable 
cuts between character components based on minimum 
cost path estimation. Then we propose a new sharpness 
for detecting candidate cuts from the probable cuts based 
on Laplacian zero crossing points and Sobel-Gradient. 
The average width of candidate cuts is considered as 
reference cut to identify the correct cuts between 
character components. Experimental results on real 
industry dataset of license plate shows that the proposed 
approach is robust to touching, blur, poor quality images. 
Further, comparative study with an existing approach 
shows that the proposed approach outperforms the 
existing approach."
109,Multi-oriented moving text detection,"Abstract— Detection of moving text of different orientations 
in video is challenging because of low resolution and complex 
background of video. In this paper, we propose a method based 
on motion vectors to identify the moving blocks which have linear 
and constant velocity. For each block, we compute moments and 
use k-means clustering algorithm to extract text candidate. We 
introduce a new criterion based on gradient direction of pixels in 
text candidates to remove false text candidates which we outputs 
potential text candidates. Then the method performs region 
growing to group the potential text candidates which outputs text 
lines. The method is tested on both static and moving text video 
to evaluate the performance in terms of recall, precision, F-
measure, misdetection rate and time. The results are compared 
with the well-known existing methods to show effectiveness of the 
proposed method."

110,Article Not peer-reviewed version,"Abstract: In recent years web applications and on-line business transactions have grown many 
folds. Consequently, also cyberattacks have increased and represent a serious threat to the pervasive 
digital services upon which our society relies. To mitigate cyberattacks, many countermeasures are 
deployed on computing nodes (e.g., anti-malware software) as well as on network devices to detect 
and possibly block malicious packets in transit; these monitoring devices broadly go under the name 
of firewalls. Firewalls are designed according to two main architectural approaches: software 
running on a standard or embedded computer, or purposedly designed hardware, e.g., ASICs.  
Software-based solutions have the advantage of high flexibility and can be ported on easily 
upgradable hardware. However, hardware implementation represents the only viable solution for 
high data rates. On the market, very fast devices of the latter kind are available, but their cost is 
typically very high, especially considering that their ultra-optimized design makes updating them 
very difficult, with the consequence of a rather short lifespan. As a more balanced alternative, we 
wanted to investigate the use of an FPGA architecture, , which is significantly easier to update than 
custom-built chips, and features low-latency and high-throughput characteristics concurrently, 
making it preferrable to other programmable systems based on GPUs or microcontrollers. In this 
paper a packet sniffer that has been designed on FPGA with a 1 Gbit/s data transfer rate is presented. 
The system is implemented on the FPGA development board KC705 by Xilinx, can analyze Ethernet 
frames, checking the frame fields against a set of rules defined by the user and calculates statistics 
of the received Ethernet frames over time. The designed packet sniffer has been successfully tested 
both with Ethernet frames ad hoc generated using a packets generator, and with real web traffic by 
connecting the packet sniffer to the internet."
110,A Highly Configurable Packet Sniffer Based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays for Network Security Applications,"Abstract: Web applications and online business transactions have grown tremendously in recent
years. As a result, cyberattacks have become a major threat to the digital services that are essential
for our society. To minimize the risks of cyberattacks, many countermeasures are deployed on
computing nodes and network devices. One such countermeasure is the ﬁrewall, which is designed
with two main architectural approaches: software running on standard or embedded computers, or
hardware specially designed for the purpose, such as (Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits) ASICs.
Software-based ﬁrewalls offer high ﬂexibility and can be easily ported to upgradable hardware, but
they cannot handle high data rates. On the other hand, hardware-based ﬁrewalls can process data at
very high speeds, but are expensive and difﬁcult to update, resulting in a short lifespan. To address
these issues, we explored the use of an (Field-Programmable Gate Array) FPGA architecture, which
offers low latency and high-throughput characteristics along with easy upgradability, making it a
more balanced alternative to other programmable systems, like (Graphics Processor Unit) GPUs or
microcontrollers. In this paper, we presented a packet sniffer designed on the FPGA development
board KC705 produced by Xilinx, which can analyze Ethernet frames, check the frame ﬁelds against a
set of user-deﬁned rules, and calculate statistics of the received Ethernet frames over time. The system
has a data transfer rate of 1 Gbit/s (with preliminary results of increased data rates to 10 Gbit/s)
and has been successfully tested with both ad hoc-generated Ethernet frames and real web trafﬁc by
connecting the packet sniffer to the internet."
110,untitled,"Abstract
In recent years, with the emerging of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and its application to different fields,
smart technologies have been applied to agriculture with the aim to reduce water resources and power
consumption as well as to increase the crops yield. Thus, smart greenhouses equipped with a set of
sensors have been developed that exploit solar panels to generate the needed electrical power, use smart
irrigation systems to minimize the water consumption and optimize plant growth by regulation of light,
humidity and heat.
In the context of smart control of crops, the determination of the ripening stage of fruits and vegetables
is of primary importance to maximize crops production and minimize waste in both pre-harvest and
post-harvest stage. Ripening stage determination is usually carried out by visual inspection and firmness
evaluation by an operator, techniques that are both subjective and prone to errors. Thus, there
is the
need of innovative methods to evaluate the ripening stage of fruits and vegetables that must be
inexpensive, reliable, accurate and suitable to be integrated in a sensor network.
In this work, Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is investigated as a technique to evaluate tomato
ripening in the post-harvest stage. Three different sensor configurations, suitable for destructive and
non-destructive tests, different in terms of electrodes type and accuracy, are presented. The results
show that the application of EIS for the automatic evaluation of tomato ripening stage is feasible and
can be implemented to increase crops yield in smart greenhouses."
110,Journal of Instrumentation,"Abstract: Data breaches and cyberattacks represent a severe problem in higher education institutions
and universities that can result in illegal access to sensitive information and data loss. To enhance
the security of data transmission, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS, i.e., firewalls) and Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS, i.e., packet sniffers) are used to detect potential threats in the exchanged
data. IPSs and IDSs are usually designed as software programs running on a server machine.
However, when the speed of exchanged data is too high, this solution can become unreliable. In this
case, IPSs and IDSs designed on a real hardware platform, such as ASICs and FPGAs, represent a
more reliable solution. This paper presents a packet sniffer that was designed using a commercial
FPGA development board. The system can support a data throughput of 10 Gbit/s with preliminary
results showing that the speed of data transmission can be reliably extended to 100 Gbit/s. The
designed system is highly configurable by the user and can enhance the data protection of information
transmitted using the Ethernet protocol. It is particularly suited for the security of universities
and research centers, where point-to-point network connections are dominant and large amount of
sensitive data are shared among different hosts."
110,Efficient and Accurate Analog Voltage Measurement Using a Direct Sensor-to-Digital Port Interface for Microcontrollers and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays,"Abstract: Portable sensor systems are usually based on microcontrollers and/or Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are interfaced with sensors by means of an Analog-to-Digital converter
(ADC), either integrated in the computing device or external. An alternative solution is based on
the direct connection of the sensors to the digital input port of the microcontroller or FPGA. This
solution is particularly interesting in the case of devices not integrating an internal ADC or featuring
a small number of ADC channels. In this paper, a technique is presented to directly interface sensors
with analog voltage output to the digital input port of a microcontroller or FPGA. The proposed
method requires only a few passive components and is based on the measurements of the duty cycle
of a digital square-wave signal. This technique was investigated by means of circuit simulations
using LTSpice and was implemented in a commercial low-cost FPGA device (Gowin GW1NR-9). The
duty cycle of the square-wave signal features a good linear correlation with the analog voltage to
be measured. Thus, a look-up table to map the analog voltage values to the measured duty cycle is
not required with benefits in terms of memory occupation. The experimental results on the FPGA
device have shown that the analog voltage can be measured with a maximum accuracy of"
110,Field-Deployable Determinations of Peroxide Index and Total Phenolic Content in Olive Oil Using a Promising Portable Sensor System,"Abstract: Useful information about the oxidative stability of a virgin olive oil in terms of oxidation
products and antioxidant compounds can be obtained by analyzing the peroxide index (PI) and
total phenolic content (TPC), respectively. These quality parameters are usually determined in a
chemical laboratory using expensive equipment, toxic solvents, and well-trained personnel. This
paper presents a novel portable sensor system for in the ﬁeld and rapid determination of PI and TPC
that is particularly suited in the case of small production environments that cannot afford an internal
laboratory for quality control analysis. The system is small, can be powered by both USB ports and
batteries, is easy to operate, and integrates a Bluetooth module for wireless data transmission. It
estimates the PI and TPC in olive oil from the measurement of the optical attenuation of an emulsion
between a reagent and the sample under test. The system has been tested on a set of 12 olive oil
samples (eight for calibration and four for validation), and the results have shown how the considered
parameters can be estimated with good accuracy. The maximum deviation from the results obtained
with the reference analytical techniques is 4.7 meq O2/kg in the case of PI and 45.3 ppm in the case of
TPC for the calibration set, while it is 14.8 meq O2/kg in the case of PI and 55 ppm in the case of TPC
for the validation set."
110,Novel BTI Robust Ring-Oscillator-Based Physically Unclonable Function,"Abstract—Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have 
become a promising low-cost solution for authentication and 
key generation in cryptosystems. However, it has been shown 
in the literature that the reliability of PUFs is undermined by 
aging mechanisms, such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), 
which may compromise their correct operation. In this paper, 
we present a novel ring oscillator (RO) based PUF design that 
is robust against BTI degradation, hereinafter referred to as 
Low-sensitive-BTI RO - LBTIRO. We compare our proposed 
LBTIRO to the standard RO-based PUF and to an alternative 
NBTI-robust RO-PUF recently presented in the literature, for 
90 nm and 32 nm CMOS technology nodes. We show that, for 
considered technology nodes, our proposed LBTIRO features a 
higher robustness against BTI. Particularly, our LBTIRO 
enables a reduction of the impact of BTI on the oscillation 
frequency over circuit lifetime, which reaches 85.3% and 
72.1% against the standard RO and the recent alternate 
solution, respectively, for the 90 nm technology. Moreover, we 
show that our proposed LBTIRO features a reduction in terms 
of power consumption if compared to the alternative NBTI-
robust RO-PUF."
110,A Portable Battery-Operated Sensor System for Simple and Rapid Assessment of Virgin Olive Oil Quality Grade "2279,"Abstract: Virgin olive oil quality is assessed by chemical as well as sensory analysis. Two of the most
important parameters that deﬁne the quality of virgin olive oils are the free acidity and the peroxide
index. These chemical parameters are usually determined by manual titration procedures that must
be carried out in a laboratory by trained personnel. In this paper, a portable sensor system to support
the quality grade assessment of virgin olive oil is presented. The system is battery operated and
characterized by small dimensions, light weight and quick measurement response (about 30 s). The
working principle is based on the measurement of the electrical conductance of an emulsion between
a chemical reagent and the olive oil sample. Two different chemical reagents have been investigated:
(1) a hydro-alcoholic solution (HAS), made of 60% ethanol and 40% distilled water; (2) 100% distilled
water (DW). Tests have been carried out on a set of 40 olive oil samples. The results have shown how,
for most of the fresh virgin olive oil samples (31 samples out of 40), the free acidity can be estimated
with good accuracy from the electrical conductance of the emulsion using HAS as the reagent. In the
case of the full set of samples, the emulsion electrical conductance, using HAS as the reagent, is a
function of both the sample free acidity as well as the compounds produced by oil oxidation, and a
compensation method based on the measured electrical conductance, using DW as the reagent, has
been introduced to improve the accuracy in the estimated free acidity. Tests have also been carried
out on the full set of samples, using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm, to demonstrate the feasibility of
olive oil classiﬁcation according to the quality grade. The results have shown how measurements
carried out using only the HAS reagent provide better classiﬁcation accuracy than measurements
carried out using both the HAS and DW reagents. The proposed system can be a low-cost alternative
to standard laboratory analyses to evaluate the quality grade of virgin olive oil."

110,Investigation of the Impact of BTI Aging Phenomenon on Analog Amplifiers,"Abstract
CMOS technology scaling allows the design of even more complex system but, at the same time, introduces some reliability 
problems. In particular, aggressively scaled microelectronic technologies are affected by the Bias Temperature Instability 
(BTI) aging phenomenon that results in an increase of the absolute value of the transistor threshold voltage with aging time 
and a consequent reduction for the microelectronic circuit reliability. In this paper we estimate the performance degradation 
caused by BTI on an operational amplifier (OPAMP) in open loop configuration as well as on three  other analog amplifiers 
based on OPAMPs. The results have shown that BTI can seriously impact the performance of the investigated circuits, and 
that such performance degradation worsens as operating temperature increases. We also briefly describe a possible low-cost 
monitoring scheme to detect the performance degradation of the OPAMPs caused by BTI. The effectiveness of our monitor 
has been validated by means of pre-layout electrical simulations, and the results have shown that it can be reliably used to 
evaluate the OPAMPs aging degradation."
110,Evaluation of Olive Oil Quality Grade Using a Portable Battery-Operated Sensor System "2279,"Abstract: Olive oil quality is normally assessed by chemical analysis as well as sensory analysis
to detect the presence of organoleptic defects. Two of the most important parameters that deﬁne
the quality of olive oil are the free acidity and the peroxide index. These chemical parameters are
usually determinated by manual titration procedures that must be carried out in a laboratory by
trained personnel. In this paper, a portable sensor system to evaluate the quality grade of olive
oil is presented. The system is battery operated and characterized by small dimensions, a light
weight and quick measurement response. The working principle is based on the measurement of the
electrical conductance of an emulsion between a hydro-alcoholic solution and the olive oil sample.
Tests have been carried out on a set of 17 olive oil samples. The results have shown how for fresh
olive oil samples, the olive oil’s free acidity can be estimated from the electrical conductance of the
emulsion. In the case of oxidized olive oil, the measured electrical conductance is also the function of
the oxidation level, and a conductance threshold can be set to discriminate between extra virgin olive
oils and lower-quality grade oils. The proposed system can be a low-cost alternative to standard
laboratory analysis to evaluate the quality grade of olive oil."
110,Energy Harvesting Strategies for Wireless Sensor Networks and Mobile Devices: A Review,"Abstract: Wireless sensor network nodes and mobile devices are normally powered by batteries that,
when depleted, must be recharged or replaced. This poses important problems, in particular for
sensor nodes that are placed in inaccessible areas or biomedical sensors implanted in the human body
where the battery replacement is very impractical. Moreover, the depleted battery must be properly
disposed of in accordance with national and international regulations to prevent environmental
pollution. A very interesting alternative to power mobile devices is energy harvesting where energy
sources naturally present in the environment (such as sunlight, thermal gradients and vibrations) are
scavenged to provide the power supply for sensor nodes and mobile systems. Since the presence of
these energy sources is discontinuous in nature, electronic systems powered by energy harvesting
must include a power management system and a storage device to store the scavenged energy. In this
paper, the main strategies to design a wireless mobile sensor system powered by energy harvesting
are reviewed and different sensor systems powered by such energy sources are presented."

Introduzione* 
 
La tesi ha come argomento la storia veterotestamentaria di Iefte (Jdc 10,6-12,7). 
L’idolatria degli Israeliti ha condotto YHWH a scatenare contro di loro la furia degli 
Ammoniti, i quali occupano militarmente la regione transgiordana del Galaad per diciotto 
anni e si approntano a conquistare tutto Israele. Messo alle strette, il popolo chiede perdono 
alla divinità, che accetta di salvarli dal disastro imminente. Iefte entra allora in scena 
attraverso un’analessi in cui viene raccontata la sua infanzia tormentata: figlio di una 
prostituta e cacciato dalla sua famiglia alla morte del padre, fugge nel deserto di Tob e 
diventa il capo di una banda di mercenari. Sotto la minaccia dei nemici, gli Israeliti gli 
domandano di tornare in qualità di capo e di condottiero. Dopo qualche reticenza, egli accetta 
la carica e prova a risolvere il conflitto per via diplomatica, ricordando al re Ammonita che 
Israele detiene il possesso del territorio fin dai tempi della conquista di Mosè. Le trattative 
falliscono e Iefte riceve su di lui lo Spirito divino; pronuncia allora un voto che lo obbligherà, 
in caso di vittoria, a offrire in olocausto a Dio chiunque gli verrà incontro da casa sua al suo 
ritorno. Al successo della battaglia si contrappone la tragedia personale: la vittima designata 
dal destino è la sua unica figlia, subito uscita per festeggiare il padre vincitore. Dopo un 
dialogo ricco di pathos, la fanciulla lo incoraggia a ottemperare alla promessa sacra, 
domandando soltanto due mesi per piangere la sua verginità sui monti con le amiche. Al suo 
ritorno il giudice compie quanto promesso e viene istituita una festa in onore della ragazza 
morta per la salvezza di Israele. La tribù israelitica di Efraim, tuttavia, si muove in armi 
contro Iefte, perché lo vuole punire per non averli chiamati alla battaglia contro il nemico 
comune. Anche in questo caso il Galaadita espone a parole il suo punto di vista, ma lo scontro 
ha inizio e la vittoria arride al giudice. Gli Efraimiti in fuga cercano di trovare riparo oltre il 
Giordano, ma i soldati di Iefte, dopo averli riconosciuti grazie ad una differenza di pronuncia, 
non fanno prigionieri.

Il lavoro è diviso in due parti: la prima riguarda il testo biblico e ha come scopo 
quello di proporre una nuova analisi del passo sotto gli aspetti critico-testuale, storico e 
letterario, che a loro volta costituiscono la base per una contestualizzazione del racconto e 
dei suoi temi all’interno dell’intero corpus biblico. La seconda si concentra invece sulla 
storia delle interpretazioni del passo nel mondo antico greco e latino, a partire dall’epoca 
giudeo-ellenistica fino all’inizio del V secolo, e prevede la costituzione di un dossier dei 
passi che commentano l’episodio. Ogni fonte è presentata in lingua originale, con una mia 
traduzione e un commento che illustra i principali temi testuali, letterari ed esegetici. Dato 
che la maggior parte dei saggi sull’argomento predilige l’uno o l’altro aspetto, si è ritenuto 
utile affrontare insieme tanto lo studio del testo biblico, quanto la sua esegesi: il racconto di 
Giudici, dunque, è stato esaminato sia come testo in formazione, mosso da interessi certo 
religiosi, ma anche storici e letterari dell’‘autore’ nell’àmbito della sua cultura di 
provenienza, sia come monumentum aere perennius (Hor. Carm. III 30,1), dove la parola 
ormai cristallizzata dalla sacralità viene ‘ruminata’ per ricavarne un insegnamento morale e 
una più chiara comprensione della divinità. Se da un lato, dunque, le due sezioni della tesi 
sono autonome, perché la ricezione assume il testo come già codificato e, nel caso della 
maggior parte degli esegeti cristiani, esula dall’originale ebraico, dall’altro il lavoro stesso 
sul testo biblico, operato tanto nel momento di composizione, quanto nella sua trasmissione 
e nelle sue traduzioni, partecipa di un analogo sforzo ermeneutico. L’uno e l’altro momento, 
pertanto, non possono che essere considerati complementari se si vuole ricostruire la storia 
di Jdc 10,6-12,7 tra la sua stesura ad opera di una piccola popolazione mediorientale e la sua 
interpretazione nei luoghi più disparati dell’Impero romano. 
Questa storia dell’Antico Testamento è particolarmente ricca di temi (la nascita 
illegittima dell’eroe, il voto, il sacrificio umano, la fuga sui monti, la morte in stato verginale, 
la valenza espiatrice di una morte per la salvezza del popolo), che concorrono a creare una 
grande problematica a livello teologico: perché YHWH ha permesso il sacrificio di 
un’innocente? La questione della teodicea ha sfidato le migliori menti del Giudaismo e del 
Cristianesimo fino ad oggi, ed esse hanno interpretato il testo nella maniera più disparata per 
trovare risposte innanzitutto teologiche. Un ruolo di primaria importanza ha in questo senso 
il tentativo di datazione dell’opera, a seconda della quale il medesimo testo può essere letto 
sotto una luce completamente differente: infatti, una datazione antica dell’episodio potrebbe 
far pensare al ricordo di antichi usi cultuali, mentre una molto recente ha fatto ipotizzare 
un’influenza della cultura ellenistica. Il tentativo di identificazione dell’‘autore’ e del 
periodo di composizione è pertanto il focus principale delle ricerche sul testo biblico.

Per arrivare a tale traguardo le ricerche partono dal confronto tra le versioni della 
narrazione. L’episodio di Iefte è esaminato nelle versioni ebraica (testo masoretico), greca 
(LXX: Codex Alexandrinus e Codex Vaticanus) e latina (Vulgata), che hanno assunto nel 
tempo un valore storico di primaria importanza in quanto testi ufficiali del Giudaismo, della 
Chiesa greca e di quella latina. Ciascun testo è presentato in lingua originale ed è corredato 
della mia traduzione, mentre in nota sono segnalati i principali problemi testuali riscontrati; 
inoltre, viene presentata una cursoria trattazione delle maggiori differenze apportate al testo 
nel Targum. Anche nei casi di corruttele testuali, infatti, il testo canonico è importante sia 
dal punto di vista della tradizione, per comprendere le relazioni esistenti tra le versioni 
antiche, sia da quello della storia dell’esegesi, perché taluni errori testuali furono spiegati 
mediante il ricorso all’allegoria. Ciascuna di queste versioni presenta vari problemi, che 
trovano origine nell’assenza di una vera e propria edizione critica. In particolare, nei 
commentari moderni si osserva una distanza tra il testo ebraico ormai ‘cristallizzato’ e le sue 
traduzioni in lingua corrente, le quali, per esigenze di comprensione, sono costrette a sanare 
per via esegetica le corruttele presenti. Neanche la versione dei LXX è immune da problemi 
analoghi, perché la traduzione greca, già progettata per essere una resa letterale del modello 
ebraico e successivamente rielaborata perché corrispondesse ancor di più al testo masoretico, 
è stata talvolta addolcita nelle sue spigolosità dai traduttori moderni. Questa tesi si prefigge, 
attraverso una resa volutamente letterale di entrambi i testi editi da Rahlfs, di mostrare invece 
il ruolo funzionale che il testo di Giudici LXX tende ad assumere nel corso delle 
rielaborazioni. Lo spoglio analitico dei testi permette infatti di individuare, versetto per 
versetto, le maggiori differenze che intercorrono tra le versioni del passo, cui si aggiungono 
anche le varianti delle altre fonti antiche, in special modo quelle attestate nei codici greci 
della recensione antiochena, nei tre revisori greci (Aquila, Simmaco, Teodozione), nelle 
Veteres Latinae, nel Targum e nelle traduzioni siriache. Le note, anche quelle più 
‘descrittive’, hanno la funzione di sottolineare le differenze di resa tra le recensioni dei LXX: 
il confronto tra le ‘varianti’ consente infatti di ipotizzare in alcuni casi la lezione di partenza, 
poi corrottasi nel corso della tradizione. I risultati dell’analisi permettono una riflessione 
tanto sul rapporto tra il testo masoretico e il modello ebraico dei LXX, quanto sulle relazioni 
tra le varie recensioni dei LXX. Le osservazioni intendono ricalibrare due principî su cui si 
sono finora basati gli studi sul testo biblico: sul versante ebraico, il ricorso abituale all’idea 
che le differenze dei LXX rispetto al testo masoretico di Giudici siano dovute a una Vorlage 
diversa; sul versante greco, l’opinione invalsa secondo la quale il testo afferente al Codice 
Vaticano riporterebbe sempre una lezione deteriore rispetto agli altri gruppi. Le informazioni

ricavate dall’analisi del testo formano la base di dati su cui verrà impostato il commento 
storico e letterario del passo, che si propone di arrivare al fine ultimo di questa ricerca, cioè 
l’individuazione dell’‘autore’ e dell’epoca della redazione finale del brano. Anche in questo 
caso si è tentato un approccio diverso rispetto agli studi precedenti: la critica, infatti, può 
essere divisa tra saggi di matrice critico-testuale, che ricercano il presunto nucleo originale 
del racconto, e altri che prendono in esame più specificamente la sezione del voto e del 
sacrificio umano, che viene separata dal contesto della narrazione perché spesso ritenuta più 
recente rispetto al resto dell’episodio. In questa sede si è allora tentata una 
contestualizzazione del brano nella sua integralità attraverso l’analisi del lessico e dei temi 
presenti dell’episodio, che vengono raffrontati con episodi analoghi nell’Antico Testamento. 
Si è voluto cioè valutare se si possa supporre un revisore ‘solitario’, oppure se il racconto di 
Iefte rifletta un quadro teologico concorde con la mentalità deuteronomistica. 
La seconda parte della tesi si concentra sulla ricezione dell’episodio nell’Antichità 
greco-latina. Gli studi sull’argomento hanno già ricostruito la storia dell’esegesi affrontando 
i vari passi in un’ottica prevalentemente teologica: in questo senso, le interpretazioni antiche, 
riassunte cursoriamente, sono state commentate esclusivamente in senso contenutistico e per 
questo si trovano spesso raggruppate per aree tematiche. In questa sede, invece, si è tentato 
di analizzare ogni brano a partire dal suo contesto: le occorrenze trattate non sono state 
presentate come frammenti ‘isolati’, ma all’interno del discorso sviluppato dal singolo 
autore. Anche in questa parte l’inizio dell’analisi parte dalla lettura del testo originale e dalla 
nuova traduzione proposta per ogni passo. La versione ha tentato di rendere di volta in volta 
lo scopo e lo stile di ciascun autore: come per il testo masoretico i costrutti ebraici sono stati 
resi con le strutture sintattiche correnti nella lingua italiana, mentre la loro traduzione 
‘pedissequa’ nei LXX è stata riprodotta con analoghe ‘sgrammaticature’, così per i brani 
esegetici si è voluto mantenere l’aspetto predominante di ciascun testo mediante la 
piacevolezza della narrazione, la sontuosità della poesia oppure la scrupolosità del trattato. 
Coerentemente con questo principio, le opere in versi sono state tradotte in endecasillabi 
sciolti, per dare un’idea almeno approssimativa della loro natura ritmica.  
L’importanza attribuita alla lingua originale come veicolo di informazioni ha indotto 
a limitare la ricerca alle attestazioni in greco e latino, anche se sono state ricordate altre 
interpretazioni trasmesse in lingue diverse. Tale scelta, che pur mette da parte per il momento 
l’approfondimento dell’episodio nell’ambiente giudaico post-ellenistico, si è resa infatti 
preferibile rispetto a un’esposizione unitaria di tipo strettamente ‘tematico’ perché, oltre al 
fatto che studi di questo tenore esistono già, l’analisi minuziosa dei singoli passi e il loro 
10 
 
confronto hanno permesso di proporre interventi testuali mirati, alcuni dei quali hanno già 
visto la pubblicazione (cf. Grossi 2016; vd. anche Grossi 2013). Grazie a questa 
impostazione l’esame del pensiero teologico nei confronti dell’episodio biblico permette 
anche di apportare alcune modifiche alle opere che conservano le attestazioni, in virtù della 
differente focalizzazione con cui ci si avvicina al testo. In effetti, l’analisi del passo nel suo 
contesto letterario ed ermeneutico permette una riflessione innovativa su problemi testuali 
legati ai testimoni antichi che finora hanno minato parzialmente la ricostruzione della storia 
esegetica. I due passaggi risultano così complementari: l’approccio ‘tematico’ consente di 
esaminare le questioni critico-testuali sotto una prospettiva nuova, la soluzione dei problemi 
risulta necessaria per comprendere meglio lo sviluppo esegetico di Jdc 10,6-12,7. In questa 
ricerca ci si è posti dunque l’obiettivo preliminare di appianare le criticità maggiori che 
ostacolavano la ricostruzione del pensiero antico. 
Il primo scoglio, e forse il più importante per la storia dell’esegesi del passo, riguarda 
due frammenti catenari di commento a Jdc 11,30 e 12,6 (PG XII 949) di dubbia autenticità 
origeniana. Il testo è di importanza primaria, perché contiene una condanna inequivocabile 
del gesto di Iefte che segna una svolta nella storia delle interpretazioni. Di fatto, 
l’accettazione dell’attribuzione a Origene implica che il biasimo per quel sacrificio umano 
sia avvenuto nel Cristianesimo fin dal III secolo, mentre il suo rifiuto comporta tanto una 
modifica nella datazione di questo importante cambiamento esegetico, quanto una 
rivalutazione dell’estensione del corpus omiletico dell’Alessandrino su tale libro biblico. Se 
la risoluzione di questa impasse è importante per determinare la corretta interpretazione di 
Origene sul Galaadita, nello stesso tempo permette di affrontare la questione intricata della 
trasmissione dei sermoni da un punto di vista diverso. Il frammento in questione, infatti, 
sarebbe tra i pochi conservati in lingua originale per le Omelie sui Giudici, la cui traduzione 
latina si interrompe improvvisamente alla spiegazione del cap. 7. L’indagine verte dunque 
non soltanto sui testi tràditi, ma anche su quelli ‘assenti’, per cercare di comprendere se la 
mancanza di un’esegesi ad hoc nelle Omelie sui Giudici sia dovuta a una perdita meccanica 
oppure a una scelta deliberata. 
Un altro problema rilevante si riscontra nel corpus di Ambrogio, dove la mancanza 
di una datazione certa per il trattato conosciuto come De virginitate ha a lungo inficiato la 
corretta comprensione dello sviluppo interpretativo del vescovo per quanto riguarda 
l’episodio di Iefte. In quell’opera, infatti, Ambrogio offre un’interpretazione del passo per 
molti aspetti diversa dalle altre, che la critica non ha potuto situare cronologicamente. 
Invece, è proprio questa singolarità a rendere ancor più necessaria un’indagine sul periodo 
11 
 
di composizione su cui orientare la ricostruzione della storia del pensiero esegetico 
dell’autore. Anche in questo caso, dunque, i cambiamenti di interpretazione all’interno del 
corpus di un autore possono costituire un importante elemento di datazione, e, allo stesso 
tempo, necessitano di una data perché il cammino interpretativo dell’autore sia interamente 
compreso.  
Analogamente, il confronto tra le interpretazioni degli autori afferenti alla scuola 
antiochena permette di elaborare indizi nuovi su alcune opere anonime o di dubbia 
autenticità (alcuni frammenti catenari, le Quaestiones et responsiones ad Orthodoxos, gli 
Atti di Guria e Samona). In particolare, le ricerche sull’origine delle Quaestiones ad 
Orthodoxos, che una parte della critica attribuisce a Teodoreto di Cirro, possono ricevere 
beneficio dal parallelo con l’esegesi sicuramente riconducibile al vescovo: la comunanza tra 
le fonti sosterrebbe l’ipotesi della paternità dell’autore, mentre la loro dissonanza può essere 
usata come indizio per screditare questa idea.  
Per mettere pienamente a frutto questa ricerca intra- e intertestuale si è deciso di 
strutturare il dossier in ordine cronologico per autore, piuttosto che geografico-tematico, 
come invece ha fatto Thompson (2001). Sebbene la maggior parte degli scrittori esaminati 
viva nella seconda metà del IV secolo, per cui talvolta l’opera di un esegeta trattato in 
precedenza può essere leggermente più recente di un testo illustrato in séguito, questa scelta 
appare preferibile alle altre possibilità, perché permette di porre in risalto i legami tra gli 
antichi teologi e di offrire un quadro più realistico della storia dell’esegesi nelle letterature 
religiose dell’Antichità. 
L’attenzione all’aspetto cronologico ha fatto sì che fossero marcati i limiti temporali 
di questa ricerca. Il corpus sulla ricezione prevede lo studio dei passi che offrono 
un’interpretazione dell’episodio di Iefte nei testi in lingua greca e latina fino all’inizio del V 
secolo. Non sono pertanto trattate le citazioni che utilizzano il racconto di Giudici con altri 
scopi, quali ad esempio quello di recuperare informazioni relative alla cronologia degli 
eventi biblici1, o alla toponomastica veterotestamentaria2, oppure alle cause di culti 
eterodossi3. Per non caricare ulteriormente la raccolta si è deciso, inoltre, di omettere la 
presentazione delle citazioni di Hbr 11,324 – dove Iefte è citato insieme ad altri personaggi"
110,Computer Vision Approach for the Determination of Microbial Concentration and Growth Kinetics Using a Low Cost Sensor System,"Abstract: The measurement of microbial contamination is of primary importance in diﬀerent ﬁelds,
from environmental monitoring to food safety and clinical analysis. Today, almost all microbiology
laboratories make microbial concentration measurements using the standard Plate Count Technique
(PCT), a manual method that must be performed by trained personnel. Since manual PCT analysis
can result in eye fatigue and errors, in particular when hundreds of samples are processed every day,
automatic colony counters have been built and are commercially available. While quick and reliable,
these instruments are generally expensive, thus, portable colony counters based on smartphones have
been developed and are of low cost but also not accurate as the commercial benchtop instruments.
In this paper, a novel computer vision sensor system is presented that can measure the microbial
concentration of a sample under test and also estimate the microbial growth kinetics by monitoring
the colonies grown on a Petri dish at regular time intervals. The proposed method has been in-house
validated by performing PCT analysis in parallel under the same conditions and using these results as
a reference. All the measurements have been carried out in a laboratory using benchtop instruments,
however, such a system can also be realized as an embedded sensor system to be deployed for
microbial analysis outside a laboratory environment."
110,Impact of Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) Aging Phenomenon on Clock Deskew Buffers,"Abstract
In this paper we analyze the effect of the Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) aging phenomenon on the delay of deskew buffers
employed in high performance microprocessors. Our analysis shows that, during circuit lifetime, the delay induced by BTI on
each deskew buffer within the microprocessor can be significantly different, depending on how each deskew buffer is configured
after fabrication (to compensate clock skews occurring during the fabrication process) and the operating temperature. Therefore,
we show that even if deskew buffers compensate skews among clock signals after fabrication, their different level of degradation
during circuit lifetime can generate significant skews between clock signals after only some month of circuit operation in the
field. Moreover, the variations in the delay of deskew buffers due to BTI can exceed the maximum compensation range enabled
by such schemes, thus making skew compensation during circuit lifetime ineffective. Finally, we propose a simple mathematical
model enabling to estimate the maximum skew among clock signals during the chip lifetime. The model can be used to activate
proactive compensation approaches (e.g., clock frequency reduction) allowing to avoid malfunctions caused by an excessive
skew among clock signals generated by BTI degradation of the deskew buffers."
110,Measurement of Bacterial Concentration Using a Portable Sensor System With a Combined Electrical-Optical Approach,"Abstract—Bacterial concentration, an important parameter
for different applications, is usually measured by means of the
plate count technique (PCT), a laboratory method that is reliable
but also time consuming (24–72 h) and not easily implementable
in automatic form. This paper investigates two alternative meth-
ods, based on electrical and optical measurements, suitable to
realize mobile, low-cost and user friendly instruments. A com-
parative analysis for both methods is performed with enriching
medium solutions and milk samples inoculated with four dif-
ferent bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus).The results
show that both methods can detect the bacterial concentration
more easily and in shorter time than PCT (3–14 h) and, in many
cases, the optical approach provides a faster response than the
electrical one (30–240 min) and higher accuracy (R2 > 0.9).
Furthermore, it is found that, in some cases, the combined use
of optical and electrical measurements allows to determine the
type of bacterial species present in the sample. Both such methods
have been implemented in the form of a portable and automatic
sensor system, suitable for in-situ measurements with no need of
trained personnel."
110,Practical Determination of Solid Fat Content in Fats and Oils by Single-Wavelength Near-Infrared Analysis,"Abstract—The melting proﬁle of solid fat content (SFC) is an
important parameter for many fat-based food products, such as
solid matrices, emulsions, and dispersions, since it can provide
essential information on product stability, physical appearance,
spreadability, mouthfeeling, particles adsorption and coalescence,
and on the release of compounds in the encapsulation technology.
The current standard techniques to measure SFC, namely,
pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), provide accurate results but require expensive
instrumentation and trained personnel. On the other hand,
techniques are needed for fast, in situ measurements by generic
operators along production lines to control industrial processes.
In this paper, a novel technique to measure SFC in vegetable
fats and oils is presented that could be implemented in the form
of a low-cost, portable electronic system. The method is based
on single-wavelength (835 nm) optical measurements during a
thermal cycle of the sample under test. The experimental results
obtained with such a method are in good/excellent agreement
with those provided by DSC (R2 > 0.9), thus indicating that
the proposed technique could represent the basis for practical
analysis in production environment, in order to evaluate the
quality and the properties of liquid and solid fat food materials."
111,INTERN ATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING VOL. 15 NO. 3 (2023) 163-169  ,"Abstract: The demand for water cleanup rises in tandem with a country's requirements and development. 
Recovery of purified water containing nutrients and other beneficial materials is a critical opportunity that must be 
taken advantage of. A challenge that needs to be tackled is the necessity for large capacity and high-value 
management of sludge waste following the water treatment process. The pH level and microwave frequencies 
influence were used as a starting point for assessing the content of the sludge waste. Microwave non-destructive 
testing (MNDT) is a microwave measurement that can be used to determine the dielectric characteristics of 
materials without destroying or modifying the sample's content. The methodology employs a free-space 
measurement technique with a frequency range of 8 to 12 GHz (X-band). Through S-parameters acquired, a 
correlation analysis was done to analyze the effect of frequencies with the sludge waste. A comparative 
investigation with peat soil samples in establishing if the sludge has similar attributes to normal soil is used to 
ensure the accuracy of the sludge waste data. It can be determined that the sludge waste has a high signal 
correlation towards the frequency band 8 GHz to 12 GHz, which is compatible with the MNDT approach. All of 
the sludge samples had a pH range that is appropriate for agricultural use."

applications. In this paper, a footprint area of CPRDRA is 
reduced using high dielectric constant dielectric resonator (İr =

better than 24 dB in the operating frequency band. RHCP in 
CPRDRA is generated using wideband branch line coupler. The 
RHCP gain in CPRDRA are stronger than the left hand circular

realized gain of CPRDRA is 2.9 dB at zenith. Axial ratio of 
compact CPRDRA is better than 3 dB at zenith to ±48° for phi=0,

112,Microwave based Non-Invasive Localized Anomaly Detection in Wood as a Biological Tissue Phantom,"Abstract— Localized anomalies in biological tissues, such as 
tumors, wounds, and edema, possess microwave properties 
starkly different from the healthy tissues. Microwave imaging 
(MWI) utilizes the changes in the electric properties of the 
tissues to detect anomalies in these tissues by forming an image 
of the test region. We present a novel, non-invasive technique to 
detect the localized anomalies in biological tissues using 
microwaves for in-vivo applications. Here, the scattering 
measurements of the test specimen are carried out in the 
microwave frequency range using a Vector Network Analyzer 
(VNA), and a modified calibration technique is utilized for de-
embedding the calibration plane to the surface of the sample. 
Wood is used as a biological tissue phantom in the present 
situation, where a localized anomaly is introduced. The 
transmission characteristics of the wood sample measured 
using the VNA are utilized to estimate the change in attenuation 
and phase constant due to the"
112,A Novel Tumour Characterization in Microwave Imaging Using Pattern-Based Weighted DMAS,"Abstract—The usage of microwave imaging for biomedical 
(BMWI) applications is still challenging due to the imprecise 
reconstruction of the relative permittivity (εr) of tissues and the 
ill-posed inverse scattering problem. Here, a novel two-step 
approach is proposed for tumour characterization in the BMWI 
framework. The focus is distinguishing normal and tumourous 
tissues using a non-iterative approach. An intensity map of the 
target region is generated to detect the tumour. Then the area 
around the tumour is further processed to obtain the refined 
image in terms of the effective εr. As the tumour is embedded in 
tissues of higher dielectric constant, the image thus formed will 
usually be larger in size than the actual tumour. Thus, to 
estimate the accurate size, we propose a novel antenna pattern-
based weighted delay, multiply, and sum algorithm along with 
principal component analysis as a synthetic focusing technique. 
Subsequently, the effective dielectric profile of the embedding 
medium is approximately estimated, which is close to their 
actual values."
112,Free-Space Time-Domain Approach for Dielectric Imaging of Biological Tissues,"Abstract—Quantitative microwave imaging (MWI) has been an ongo-
ing challenge in the scientiﬁc community due to the difﬁculties as-
sociated with the dielectric constant computation for biological tis-
sues in a real scenario. This work explores a novel methodology
for in-vivo, dielectric imaging of biological tissues by estimating their
dielectric properties in a practical scenario using the free-space mea-
surement setup. The proposed scheme utilizes a Vivaldi antenna,
working in the range of 1–10 GHz, to measure the reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient of the material under test (MUT) in the free space with metallic reﬂectors as references. The relative shift in
the time-domain associated with various samples is then used to estimate the dielectric constant of the MUT. The
applicability of the proposed scheme is ﬁrst demonstrated using the simulation-based models for various standard
samples. For biomedical applications, subcutaneous fat tissue is used as an MUT, and the water content is var-
ied to emulate various abnormal conditions. Finally, the proposed scheme is experimentally validated by employing
wood as a biological phantom, and the measurements are carried out by varying the water content in the refer-
ence sample. It is observed that the dielectric constant of samples can be computed quite accurately (with an error
margin of <7%). This indicates the competence of the proposed scheme for utilization in in-body dielectric imaging."
112,A Compact and Novel Photoacoustic Sensing Technique for In Vitro Characterization of Blood Viscosity: A Phantom-Based Study,"Abstract—The feasibility of the continuous wave laser diode-based photoacoustic (CWPA)
sensing technique in estimating blood viscosity and red blood cell concentration, as
well as measuring the blood vessel diameter, is demonstrated here. The laser-enabled
swept frequency acoustic interferometry (LE-SFAI) principle is applied here to obtain the
high signal-to-noise ratio CWPA signal. The experiments are performed using the liquid
dye–glycerol mixture and further with the tissue-mimicking phantoms. Certain distinct
features from the time domain CWPA signal are used to estimate the aforementioned
parameters. The results are veriﬁed by the results obtained from the standard instruments.
The usage of a continuous wave laser diode enables a compact and economical
photoacoustic (PA) sensing system for blood viscosity characterization and ﬁeld deployment."

112,EMiTD: Enhanced Microwave Imaging for Breast Tumor Detection,"Abstract—In this paper, we propose an Enhanced Microwave
imaging technique for efficient breast Tumor Detection referred
as EMiTD, which mainly comprises of two key steps: an intel-
ligent scanning approach to optimize the scan duration and an
efficient model-based microwave imaging (MWI) technique. The
proposed model-based MWI is framed as an inverse problem by
building the forward model using a Point Spread Function(PSF),
and is solved by imposing sparsity prior since tumor is con-
centrated to limited regions. Further, we optimize the entire
scanning duration by viewing the problem as a sequential decision
making process for a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent.
We benchmark the proposed EMiTD against other competing
techniques using a publicly available dataset. Both visual and
quantitative reconstruction results are provided which indicate
that the proposed EMiTD as compared to other competing
techniques provides significantly improved tumor localization
with close to 2× improvement in Signal to Mean Ratio (SMR).
Furthermore, negligible deterioration in visual results is observed
with the proposed approach in spite of using only 33% of the
total measurements."
112,Novel Technique Towards Hydrogeological Characterization of a Rockmass - A Millimeter-Wave SAR Approach,"ABSTRACT
Unplanned roof failure in underground coal mines is often
associated with weak strata conditions. The most common
roof rock in coal mines are shale, mudstones or claystones.
These sedimentary rocks are extremely moisture sensitive.
Hence, water percolating through the strata can result in
reduction of strength of these rocks.
Traditional contact
based geophysical inspection techniques involve physical
installment of large sensor arrays to map the target rockmass.
This paper proposes a millimeter wave synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) based non-contact technique for mapping water
saturation of a rockmass. A unique SAR phase processing
algorithm has been proposed. Furthermore, actual experiments
have been conducted with shale rock specimens to relate SAR
phase with the change in water saturation."

112,mmWave SAR Imaging of Superficial Tissue for Metallic Implant Monitoring,"Abstract: Bone implant monitoring in order to assess any unwanted mobility or dislo-
cation of the implant, and thus bone health is a critical issue. Here, we propose a novel
millimeter (mm) wave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging technique for superficial
implant monitoring. The proposed approach is safe, portable, does not use ionizing rays,
portable, and can be continuously or repeatedly used even outside emergency rooms. In
this paper, we use 60GHz pulse coherent radar on a moving platform to scan the ob-
ject of interest. A novel auto-focusing algorithm helps to generate SAR images for the
inhomogeneous human body/phantoms. The proposed method detected superficial screw
implants on sawbone phantom and human tibial screws with a accuracy of 100% and
76.2% respectively."
112,A Novel Approach for Quantifying Impact and Abrasive Wear by Short-Range mmWave InSAR,"Abstract—Runtime inspection of surface wear is impera-
tive to ascertain the production performance of a mill. Mill lin-
ers are vulnerable to impact and abrasive wear, subsequently
leading to unplanned breakdown and increased downtime.
This remains an open-problem owing to the dust-ridden
environment of a grinding mill that challenges existing
wear profiling systems. In this scenario, millimeter-waves
(mm-waves) can propagate through dust and illuminate a
visually occluded wear zone. This article presents a unique
approach to detect and quantify wear using short-range
mm-wave interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR).
We propose a set of algorithms to reduce defocusing of syn-
thetic aperture radar (SAR) images in short range; automated
identification of anchor points for precise InSAR image co-registration; and lastly quantification of surface wear from
interferograms. Our experiments demonstrate the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SAR images and efficacy
of the proposed co-registration scheme in interferometric processing. Wear estimation using the resultant interferograms
has been carried out with an MSE of 0.266."

Detection

progressive dynamics of wear requires repeated examinations
which is time-consuming, adding to mill downtime. Runtime
inspection inside the mill necessitates the ability to sense through
occluded media due to the presence of grinding dust. The
primary objective of this work is to assess the feasibility of using
short range interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
to detect and quantify wear or other tribological phenomena
associated with metallic surfaces. A novel variable focusing
algorithm has been used to generate SAR images and a unique
automated co-registration scheme has been employed in the
InSAR processing pipeline. The reconstructed SAR images and
the generated interferogram reﬂect strong overlap with the
ground truth of the sample under test with MSE of 0.061"

Radar (ISAR) imaging. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel
motion-induced radar imaging technique, where the object under
study undergoes a circular translation motion on a rotating
platform. A modified delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm is built
by incorporating virtual antenna array to estimate the shape of
the object and its radial and angular displacement with respect
to a fixed reference point. From the reconstructed images, it is
seen that the radial displacement as well as the angular locations

Au, Ag mono and Bimetallic Au:Ag colloidal nanoparticles were synthesized in two 
steps using pulsed laser ablation in liquid technique (pure Au, Ag metal plates of immersed in 
deionized water). The pulse laser (Q-switched,  Nd: YAG)1064 nm with energy 700 mJ, 
frequency 5 Hz and 200 laser pulses at room temperature have been used. Absorbance (SPR 
band), size, surface morphology and structure of the synthesized Nps have been studied and 
investigated by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray 
diffraction. The absorbance spectrum of Au, Ag and Au:Ag nanoparticles shows sharp and 
single peaks around 513 nm, 398 nm and 523 nm respectively. This gives indicate that the 
production of pure and spherical Au and Ag NPs with average size in the range 16 - 100 nm. 
The particles size measurements were confirmed by TEM. The Au:Ag nanoalloy appears to 
be nearly spherical with an average size ranging from 29 to 72 nm. and the SPR band at (450 
nm ). The XRD result showed very low crystallinity structure. The antibacterial activity of 
Au, Ag and bimetallic Au:Ag NPs were evaluated for NPs  obtained by PLAL using applied 
pulses (100,150,200) in DI water, on the Gram-positive isolate (Staphylococcus aureus) and 
Gram-negative isolate (Escherichia coli). The results and images of inhibition zones diameter 
showed that the NPs have synergistic effects on the studied bacteria up to 15 mm and 4 mm at 
the highest and lowest values and it increase with the increase of laser pulses number.

Titanium dioxide TiO2 nanorods were successfully grown on conductive glass FTO substrate 
using the hydrothermal method at a temperature of 160 oC. Surface topography, structure, and 
optical characteristics were studied according to the influence of annealing temperature (450, 
550, and 650) oC. The surface topography results reveal that the TiO2 had nanorods structure with 
a tetragonal shape, and the rod diameter increases from 84.2 nm to 116.6 nm with increasing the 
annealing temperature. The crystal structure of the grown TiO2 NRs exhibits a high crystallinity 
of polycrystalline nature with anatase and rutile phases. The preferential orientation was along 
(204) plane for anatase tetragonal structure. AFM image shows an intense edge, uniform surface 
morphology, and increased grain diameter with annealing temperature. The optical properties 
of TiO2 NRs were investigated, and the absorption edge shows a blue shifting as the annealing 
temperature increases when considering the crystallinity and morphology changes. The energy 
band gap was found to be lower than 3 eV, which can be attributed to the presence of anatase 
and rutile phases with an increment range from  2.72 to 2.86 nm alongside the increase in 
the annealing temperature. The results indicate that the adopted hydrothermal method and the 
synthesized TiO2 NRs were suitable for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications."

substrate at room temperature . The prepared films with different ion concentrations were 
annealed  in air at constant temperature 400 ºC and constant time (180) min .Structural and 
optical properties of  CuS thin films were investigated and analyzed extensively before and 
after annealing . The structure of the prepared  films  has been found with amorphous structure 
at different Cu ion concentrations , annealed CuS films also showed amorphous structure. The 
optical properties of CuS thin films has been  studied by transmittance  and absorbance spectral 
in the  range of wave length (190-1100)nm by using UV- Vis.  spectrophotometer. 
Transmittance decreased with increasing the Cu ion concentrations of CuS films, also the 
transmittance increased with annealing process  for (CuS) thin films. The fundamental 
absorption edge of (CuS) thin films shifted to word the lowest photon  energies with increasing 
the Cu ions concentrations before and after annealing. From the absorption coefficient values 
which calculated from the absorbance spectrum which is larger than 10-4cm-1 gives an indicate 
that CuS films were direct semiconductors and the electronic transition was a direct transition. 
The optical energy gap values of CuS thin films for allowed direct transition  found vary   in 
the  range between (2.433-2.526) eV with (0.2- 0.4 M) Cu ions concentration and in the range  
of (2.416-2.349) eV for the same concentrations after annealing. The optical constant such as

        Nanocrystalline  Tin Oxide SnO2 thin films have been grown on cleaned glass 
substrates at 450 C○ using spray pyrolysis deposition technique, prepared from two 
precursor solutions SnCl2.2H2O and SnCl4.5H2O.The XRD analyses showed that these 
films have polycrystalline in nature with tetragonal rutile structure  with preferred 
orientation of (110),(200),(211) and the crystalline size (grain size) of thin films are 
found to vary from 32.6 to 56.98 nm . 
                                                                                                              
UV -VIS spectra of the films were studied using the optical absorbance measurements 
which were taken in the spectral region from 190 nm to 1100 nm. The transmittance and 
ref1ectance spectra of the films in the UV -VIS region were also studied. Optical 
Constants such as optical band gap, absorption coefficient and extinction coefficient, 
were evaluated from these spectra. All the films were found to exhibit high transmittance 
greater than (~ 85 %), and high absorbance values at ultraviolet region which they 
decrease rapidly in the visible / near infrared region. The optical band gap energy was 
found 3.98 eV for sample A and 3.97 eV for sample B."
113,The Effect of Different Wavelengths on porous Silicon Formation process,"ABSTRACT 
Porous silicon layers (PS) have been prepared in this work via Photo-
electrochemical etching process (PEC) of n-type silicon wafer of 0.8 Ω.cm resistivity 
in hydrofluoric (HF) acid of 24.5 % concentration at different etching times (5 – 
25min.). The irradiation has been achieved using Tungsten lamp with different 
wavelengths (450 nm, 535 nm and 700 nm). The morphological properties of these 
layers such as surface morphology, Porosity, layer thickness, and also the etching rate 
have been investigated using optical microscopy and the gravimetric method."

W is radiating edge; L is non radiating edge; h is thickness substrate. The ratio W/L=1,5 is usually chosen, and 
L/W << h; it gives good performance according to the side lobe appearances [8]. In practice the fringing effect 
causes the effective distance between the radiating edge of the patch to be slightly greater than L. therefore, the 
actual value of the resonant frequency is slightly less than fr. For TM0n0 mode, the length of non radiating 
rectangular patch’s edge at a certain resonance frequency and dielectric constant according to eq, (1),(2)

where Eon=-jωεrA0n0 and Hon=(nπ/L)A0n0. The electric field structure within the substrate and between the 
radiating element and the ground plane is undergoes a phase reversal along the length but it is uniform along its 
width. The phase reversal along the length is necessary for the antenna to have broadside radiation 
characteristics.

Far Field evaluation 
In order to calculate the far field, the aperture model is used; edge effects can be taken into account using 
diffraction theory [14,15]. The resonator surface is considered to be a set of four slots of width 2a [11,14]. By 
using Green’s function the following general form of the far field for any m,n,p modes.

The total field is the sum of the two element array with each element representing one of the slot. Since the slot 
are identical this is accomplished by using an array factor for two slot.

A compact PIFA (Planar Inverted F Antenna) for wireless, mobile and 
automotive applications was designed with full wave simulation software. 
Size reduction of the antenna was achieved through an increase in the 
path length of the currents for a fixed frequency. Finally, a comparison was 
made between a non-compact PIFA with a compacted PIFA.
The development of wireless technologies and mobile communications has included consid-
erable research on the production of small, easily adaptable, low cost antennas. One such device, 
the PIFA (Planar Inverted F Antenna), is widely used in mobile, automotive and wireless com-
munications. The advantage of using this type of antenna in wireless communications is its 
small size, low profile, and avoidance of additional matching networks. 
Thanks to its compact design, the PIFA has recently been developed for multiband applica-
tions. For the model investigated, shown in Figure 1, there were two main objectives: one that 
uses two electromagnetic paths to generate two separate resonant modes; the other offers the 
two first resonant frequencies of a single electromagnetic path.  In the first a slot of variable 
shape (L or U, in the figure) or two inductive or capacitive resonators is employed.  In the second 
we add just the resonance frequencies of the first two modes in a manner such that their rela-
tionship is about 2. In this case appropriately dimensioned gaps are implemented.
II. Design of the Antenna
II.1 Layout of the PIFA
Figure 1 shows a patch with a slot to the U shaped antenna. There is a central patch of the 
original size, L1×W1, and a smaller patch of size L2×W2 operating in the 1800 MHz band from 
lower frequency f1, to the highest, f2. For this type of PIFA we can be determine d approximate-
ly by:
where c is the speed light in free space: c = 3x108 m/s. These two equations make it simple 
to achieve the requirements of the dual-frequency PIFA.

High Frequency Electronics
High Frequency Design
Antenna Design
Figure 1 shows the geometry of the antenna. As you 
can see in Figure 2 (a), the upper radiating patch is 
inserted into a slot in the U for the purpose of obtaining a 
dual-frequency operation that uses two resonant paths for 
the currents induced from the feed, in order to generate 
two separate operating modes. Specifically, the resonant 
frequency for the lowest band is dictated substantially by 
the size of the patch and is only partly affected by the slot, 
while the resonance frequency for the higher band is dic-
tated mainly the size of the slot to U. The dimensions of 
the patch are higher (W1, L1) = (42, 42) mm, while the 
dimensions of the U-shaped slot are (W2, L2) = (30.28,7.00) 
mm, the ground plane has dimensions (W, L) = (60,100) 
mm. The antenna is fed to the base of the line as shown in 
Figure 1(c), at a distance (30, 2) mm from the origin of the 
axes. The antenna height is h = 12.90 mm.  The capacitive 
load is formed by bending the upper patch to the ground 
plane for a DCAP distance = 9.4mm and adding to this a 
line (5mm long), parallel to the ground plane. The short-
ing wall is 12.90mm wide and 42mm high. The antenna is 
inserted at the center of the ground plane at a distance 
(9.0) mm from the origin of axes. The entire structure was 
fabricated using a thickness of 1 mm for both ground 
planes, both for patch and the shorting wall. The slot in 
the shorting wall (shown in Figure 2) consists of two 
parts: one, with U-shape, has a height h1 = 8.4 mm and a 
width w1 = 28 mm; the other part, however, is formed by 
two smaller slots (of height h2 = 1mm and width w2 = 
14.5mm), which are merged with the larger slot in order 
to form a single opening (as shown in figure 2).
II.2 Design Features
The antenna proposed in the previous section was 
simulated with commercial full wave simulation soft-

115,"City, University of London Institutional Repository","Abstract: Matrix toughening is one of the most popular approaches to improve the overall 
fracture toughness of polymer composite materials. The most widely known approach for matrix 
toughening is the addition of a second phase such as rigid or/and rubber particles to dissipate 
the fracture energy, and vessels that containing healing agents that prevent further crack 
propagation when ruptured. Only a few studies have shown an alternative ‘active toughening’ 
by introducing an internal compressive stress field in the matrix via the mismatch in filler/matrix 
thermal expansion under heating. In this study, epoxy composite materials with embedded 
ferroelectric barium titanate nanoparticles are fabricated with the aid of silane surface 
functionalisation. Surface-bonded fibre grating sensors are employed to investigate the strain 
and temperature change of the epoxy nanocomposite materials under microwave exposure, as 
an attempt to introduce such field aided strain tailoring of the epoxy matrix as an active 
toughening mechanism."
115,Proceedings of,"Abstract 
Shape conveys information about a structure that is easily 
visualized and interpreted, and its measurement (Floris et 
al. 2021) has applications across medicine, robotics, aer-
ospace and civil engineering. The capability for shape 
measurements could be a key enabling technique for fu-
ture advances, for example shape morphing aerospace 
structures. The shape of an object may be deduced indi-
rectly from strain measurements made at strategic loca-
tions, processed using strain-deformation retrieval meth-
ods. This approach has been explored widely in recent 
years, including in aerospace applications by organiza-
tions such as NASA, often using optical fibres as the strain 
sensing technology. Optical fibres offer a number of ad-
vantages compared to standard strain gauges, notably 
their flexibility, low weight and small dimensions (~0.1 mm 
diameter). In addition, optical fibres can be embedded 
within fibre reinforced composites during fabrication, or 
can be surface-mounted to facilitate retrofitting.  
In contrast to indirect shape sensing techniques, direct fibre optic shape sensing (DFOSS), 
has the ability to measure shape directly using an optical fibre/fibre arrangement, allowing the 
fibre curvature, and therefore the path along a structure to which the fibre/fibre arrangement is 
attached, to be followed through space in three dimensions using simple path integration (see 
Fig. 1). A major advantage of DFOSS is that it removes the requirement for a detailed structural 
model of the underlying structure. Since shape is determined directly from within the sensing 
fibre/fibre arrangement, there is no reliance on external strain transfer from the structure and 
even simple surface mounting can be sufficient, providing interesting new experimental oppor-
tunities.  
Recently introduced DFOSS techniques have been successful in improving the achievable 
measurement resolution and in making the technology more robust. In particular, DFOSS us-
ing fibre segment interferometry (Kissinger et al. 2018) offers dynamic (>kHz) shape change 
data with resolutions in the micrometre range. This allows in-situ measurements of aerody-
namically-introduced structural deformations directly on aerodynamic structures, for example 
on helicopter blades. This has been demonstrated in several experimental campaigns, includ-
ing for shape measurement on static helicopter blades (Weber et al. 2021), evaluating mode

115,Production process monitoring and post-production strain measurement on a full-size carbon-fibre composite aircraft tail cone assembly using embedded optical fibre sensors,"Abstract
Multiplexed optical fibre sensors were embedded into a carbon-fibre-reinforced-preform during
the industrial production of a full-sized, one-piece tail cone assembly for a regional jet aircraft.
Optical fibre Fresnel sensors monitored both the infusion of the resin, via measurement of the
refractive index-dependent attenuation in the reflected light signal, and the degree of cure of the
resin, via measurement of the chemical cure reaction-dependent change in refractive index. The
resin cure was also monitored by optical fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) fabricated in high linearly
birefringent optical fibre, which measured through-thickness strain development, while FBGs in
standard single mode optical fibre measured longitudinal strain development. The magnitudes
and profiles of the transverse and longitudinal strains developed during the curing process were
consistent across different locations on the tail cone. Typical transverse and longitudinal strains,
related to cure reaction-induced shrinkage, were −1500 ± 17 µε and −500 ± 5 µε, respectively.
Post-production, the same embedded FBG sensors were used subsequently to monitor structural
strains when the tail cone was subjected to vacuum pressure loading. The longitudinal strains
measured using the embedded FBG sensors were generally in good agreement with the
longitudinal strains measured by the surface-bonded resistance foil strain gauge (RFSG)
sensors, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The in-plane transverse and circumferential
strains, oriented collinearly, were measured by the embedded FBGs and appropriately oriented
surface-bonded RFSG sensors, respectively, and were, qualitatively, in good agreement."

SincNet architecture has shown significant benefits over traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), espe-
cially for speaker recognition applications. SincNet comprises parameterized Sinc functions as filters in the first layer 
followed by convolutional layers. Although SincNet is compact in nature and offers top-level understanding of the 
features extracted, the effect of window function used in SincNet is not thoroughly addressed yet. Hamming and 
Hann are popularly used as the default time-localized windows to reduce spectral leakage. Hence, a comprehensive 
investigation of 28 different windowing functions on SincNet architecture towards speaker recognition task using 
TIMIT dataset was performed in this work. Additionally, “trainable” window functions were configured with tunable 
parameters to characterize the performance. The paper benchmarks the effect of the time-localized windowing 
function in terms of the bandwidth, side-lobe suppression, and spectral leakage for the filter banks employed in the

116,EEG Driven Autonomous Injection System For An Epileptic Neuroimaging Application,"Abstract— Seizure episodes are frequently observed for adults
and children suffering from medically refractory epilepsy and
the events remain debilitating unless treated with a more
comprehensive approach. Ictal perfusion studies with single-
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is one of the
non invasive imaging modality that has been extensively used to
adequately localize the seizure focus. Current practices include
the tracer injection within a short time interval at the onset of
seizure to generate desirable SPECT scan quality with accurate
information on foci region. However, the onset of a seizure is
a highly unpredictable event and also with added subclinical
events, the overall procedure makes it difﬁcult to administer
the tracer manually within the ideal time frame.
Hence a complete autonomous injection of radioactive tracer
element without manual intervention is expected to offer a
highly accurate epileptical focus region and aids in further
management of the patient. Electroencephalogram (EEG) phys-
iological signals in the preictal phase contain sufﬁcient indica-
tors to predict the seizure event. The proposed injection system
works on the seizure prediction model from the EEG signals to
release the dosage, making the system completely autonomous
in action. The accuracy of the prediction model based on
the publicly available seizure embedded EEG datasets was
designed to achieve 94% accuracy, and the model was deployed
on an edge system. The syringe based injection system was
characterized to emulate dosage release action with minimum
volumetric error, and low injection time, on predicting seizure
Ictal event from the EEG signal. The proposed system is a
step towards developing an autonomous injection system for
epileptic neuroimaging applications in hospital settings.
Clinical relevance— Autonomous injection of tracer dosage
for obtaining accurate and high quality Ictal SPECT scan
results is preferred over the manual operation in clinical and
hospital residential settings as a part of pre-surgical evaluations.
The EEG signal based early prediction of seizure ensures
adequate time for radioactive tracer element to reach the brain
cells and eventually helps to accurately localize the onset region
of seizure in the brain. The EEG driven automated injection
system for the noninvasive Ictal SPECT method is clinically
important as a pre-surgical evaluation in MRI negative or
discordant cases for further surgical actions.

116,Food Detection and Segmentation from Egocentric Camera Images,"Abstract— Tracking an individual’s food intake provides use-
ful insight into their eating habits. Technological advancements
in wearable sensors such as the automatic capture of food
images from wearable cameras have made the tracking of
food intake efﬁcient and feasible. For accurate food intake
monitoring, an automated food detection technique is needed
to recognize foods from unstaged real-world images. This work
presents a novel food detection and segmentation pipeline
to detect the presence of food in images acquired from an
egocentric wearable camera, and subsequently segment the food
image. An ensemble of YOLOv5 detection networks is trained
to detect and localize food items among other objects present
in captured images. The model achieves an overall 80.6% mean
average precision on four objects—Food, Beverage, Screen,
and Person. Post object detection, the predicted food objects
which are sufﬁciently sharp were considered for segmentation.
The Normalized-Graph-Cut algorithm was used to segment the
different parts of the food resulting in an average IoU of 82%.
Clinical relevance— The automatic monitoring of food intake
using wearable devices can play a pivotal role in the treatment
and prevention of eating disorders, obesity, malnutrition and
other related issues. It can aid in understanding the pattern of
nutritional intake and make personalized adjustments to lead
a healthy life.

116,ORIGINAL RESEARCH,"Abstract Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are non-
invasive means of measuring brain functions. EEG has
been used in areas ranging from analysis of neurological
disorders, emotional states and sleep pattern to Brain
Machine Interface. Here we study cognitive functions from
a limited set of daily activities of normal human subjects.
For this purpose, we utilize EEG signal obtained from
prefrontal cortex, speciﬁcally Brodmann Area 10L, which
is known to play an important role in these functions. In
this work, we study characteristics of a task requiring
focussed attention (Mathematical Cognition (T3)), an
involuntary response to external stimuli (Startle Response
(T2)) and the state of rest (Relax (T1)). The single channel
EEG is preprocessed and statistical features are extracted
from (i) preprocessed data, (ii) wavelet decomposition,
and (iii) cepstral analysis. These features are then sepa-
rately input to various classiﬁers. Results are reported for 2
class (T1 vs T2, T1 vs T3, T2 vs T3) and 3 class (T1 vs T2
vs T3) classiﬁcation framework. Experimental results
reveal that cepstral analysis is most effective for classiﬁ-
cation across both frameworks. In 3-class classiﬁcation,
cepstral analysis results in a mean accuracy of 96.61%
across classiﬁers. This framework is shown to be effective
in classifying the chosen set of cognitive states using EEG
and can be extended to broader classes for more conclusive

116,Improving Digital Circuit Synthesis of Complex Functions using Binary,"Abstract:
Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is regularly applied to synthesize and realize digital circuits for small
arithmetic and digital-logic functions. CGP beneﬁts in obtaining hardware-efﬁcient circuits through its heuris-
tic search-space exploration, which is hard to reach in a rule-based synthesis process. However, the traditional
CGP conﬁguration has limitations in evolving large and complex circuits, requiring a large number of gen-
erations. High computation time and energy requirements hinder its usage from evolving complex digital
circuits. This paper investigates and demonstrates the desired modiﬁcations to existing CGP in the form of
Binary Weighted Fitness (BwF) and exponentially varying mutation rate (eVar) to evolve functionally correct
solutions extremely fast. The beneﬁts are demonstrated for the basic non-linear power functions and are vali-
dated for usage in activation functions which are otherwise difﬁcult to realize. Additionally, 12 different CGP
conﬁgurations with changes in mutation scheme and evolutionary strategy were also investigated for the power
functions. A comparison with the beneﬁts of BwF and eVar adopted CGP over the traditional CGP methods
is presented and discussed.

116,Autonomous Neuro-Navigation System for Neurosurgical Robotics,"Abstract—Cranial neuro-navigation has become an integral
part of contemporary neurosurgery, and is often practiced as an
intensive manual process with the available clinical information.
The neurosurgeons decide the craniotomy path referring to a
non real time radiographic images, often leading to impromptu
deviation in the surgical plan. The real time visualization of un-
derlying structures are unavailable and the procedure highly rely
on the expertise of the surgeon. Hence an alternate and effective
method with minimal human intervention in the surgical space
is needed for practicing neurosurgical craniotomy procedures. In
this paper, an autonomous image guided neuro-navigation system
is proposed for robotic neurosurgical procedures towards making
the overall process efﬁcient and error free. The presurgical and
the intraoperative three dimensional data of the patient under
investigation are acquired and a formal craniotomy path is
decided by the neurosurgeon post co-registration of two modality
of patient’s data. A novel registration work ﬂow is incorporated
in the autonomous system that require no reference implantable
ﬁducials and is implemented in two stages. In the proposed
registration scheme, the initial coarse alignment of 3D data
is accomplished using local shape feature descriptors which is
further reﬁned by point to point registration. The developed
navigation guidance system was then validated in an experimental
setup with a needle ﬁxed to a movable drilling head. The
experimental results demonstrated successful positioning of the
needle over the speciﬁed annotated point, with an acceptable
accuracy, as referred and driven by 3D reconstructed model
derived from the set of radiographic images.

116,Surface EMG signal classification for unsupervised musical keyboard learning application,"Abstract—Learning is an integral part of human growth and it
has evolved with the advent of personal computers. The current
technologies provide enough ﬂexibility for a learner to learn on
his own and does not mandate a mentor to be physically present
while learning. However, in learning musical instruments we still
have not reached this stage. Hence, it mandates a trainer to
be present with the learner to guide. The paper aims to address
this issue by classifying ﬁnger movements of a person by tracking
muscle movements using Electromyogram (EMG) signal that will
help in evaluating the learner’s performance. EMG signal is an
effect of the human brain signaling the muscular neuron to
perform an action. For this work, EMG signal was recorded
at surface of the forearm, by an inhouse surface-EMG (sEMG)
signal acquisition system. sEMG signal was recorded for 10
seconds for four ﬁnger keypress and classiﬁcation algorithm was
implemented to identify individual key pressed for music playing
application. With the collected data, eleven features including
time and frequency domain parameters were extracted. The
feature data was standardized using a standard scaler approach
and vector dimensions were reduced using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) method. Random forest (RF) algorithm was
applied to the reduced dimension feature vector for successful
identiﬁcation of key press. A maximum classiﬁcation accuracy of
100% for two ﬁnger key press and 65.85% for four ﬁnger key
press was achieved using the sEMG signal acquisition system
for the ﬁrst time. The sEMG integrated wearable system should
enhance the unsupervised learning of musical instruments using
the proposed system.

116,Design of a Device for Lower Limb Prophylaxis and Exercise,"ABSTRACT
The problem of immobility of legs leading to a potentially life threatening condition including
deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is well known. The reduced mobility of leg affects a large number of patients
in a wide range of clinical scenarios spanning from swelling of the legs to pulmonary embolism. In normal
human beings, an elegant system of venous return, both active and passive is responsible for prevention
of deep venous thrombosis. The paper proposes a prophylaxis and exercise device that mimics the natural
principles of venous return to promote the blood ﬂow. The device is based on electromechanical actuation,
and simultaneous alternating compression mechanism, that is compact and, suitably form ﬁtted in design and
additionally requires no specialised training for the usage. The device was tested on a healthy volunteer on
two different days and ﬁndings support the efﬁcacy of the prophylaxis and exercise device in signiﬁcantly
improving the blood ﬂow rate in the lower limb. The prototype device is considered as a major step towards
designing a clinically validated lower limb device."

hardware implementation offers faster results and desirable out-

footprint and delay on a tiny decision-making edge devices with

puting promises to support the required hardware metrics in error
resilient applications where the inexact output is not deviated much
from the expected one, and decision made remains unchanged. Mul-
tiplier design blocks are heavily used in the multimedia functional
chip, and introducing approximation in these blocks effectively ben-
efits design metrics and chip cost of the developed system-on-chip
(SoC). The proposed work attempts to design and use various sizes
of approximate AND-OR re-coded compressors in the multiple re-
duction stages, along with various fast adders in the final addition
stage of multiplier design. Further, design metrics and resources
utilized for different multiplier designs were characterized in ASIC
and FPGA synthesis flows respectively, along with their error statis-
tics. Designed approximate multipliers were employed in Gaussian

116,LEAD: Logarithmic Exponent Approximate Divider For Image Quantization Application,"ABSTRACT
Most of the applications of modern day VLSI designs are approach-
ing towards energy efficient and high speed computing solutions.
Approximate computing is considered a suitable design methodol-
ogy that satisfies the current requirements of hardware and perfor-
mance metrics without compromising on the outcome significantly.
Many of the arithmetic operations are realized using approximate
computing techniques, and many successful implementations are
reported at system level designs. However divider operations in gen-
eral are rarely realized in hardware and this needs much attention
considering the surge in neural networks implementation in hard-
ware. In this paper, a novel approximate divider is proposed which
is not only characterized to have better accuracy and hardware
efficient when compared to the other accurate dividers. The pro-
posed divider is built on logarithmic divider and approximates the
exponent part to achieve the desired hardware characteristics. The
proposed 8-bit, and 16-bit divider design were realized in 45-NM
CMOS technology for different input and output data format includ-
ing integer, fixed-point, and floating-point. The proposed divider
was characterized for error and hardware metrics and compared
with other dividers. The novel divider was validated on K-means

separate surgical specialty. Surgical procedures on the brain
are performed using dedicated micro-instruments which are
designed speciﬁcally for the requirements of operating with
ﬁnesse in a conﬁned space. The usage of these microsurgical
tools in an operating environment deﬁnes the surgical skill
of a surgeon. Video recordings of micro-surgical procedures
are a rich source of information to develop automated
surgical assessment tools that can offer continuous feedback
for surgeons to improve their skills, effectively increase the
outcome of the surgery, and make a positive impact on their
patients. This work presents a novel deep learning system
based on the Yolov5 algorithm to automatically detect, localize
and characterize microsurgical tools from recorded intra-
operative neurosurgical videos. The tool detection achieves a
high 93.2% mean average precision. The detected tools are
then characterized by their on-off time, motion trajectory and
usage time. Tool characterization from neurosurgical videos
offers useful insight into the surgical methods employed by a
surgeon and can aid in their improvement. Additionally, a new
dataset of annotated neurosurgical videos is used to develop the
robust model and is made available for the research community.
Clinical relevance— Tool detection and characterization
in neurosurgery has several online and ofﬂine applications

development of automated tool characterization systems for
intra-operative neurosurgery is expected to not only improve

116,Binary neural network based real time emotion detection on an edge computing device to detect passenger anomaly,"Abstract—Passenger safety in public transportation especially
while riding in the form of shared cabs, and taxis are often
ignored, and not much preventive protocols are devised. In
the connected mobility world, emotion recognition from facial
expressions is a possibility, however a faster processing and edge
computing device to derive anomaly state inferences will be apt
for further notifying about the safety of the passenger. FPGA
implementation is a viable approach to not only implement in the
embedded system automotive electronics, but also accelerate the
inference results, hence making it as an ideal real time candidate
for passenger anomaly state identiﬁcation. For the same, a
real time emotion detection system using facial features was
implemented on FPGA. A Binary Neural Network (BNN) feeded
by Local Binary Pattern (LBP) output was designed towards
the development of an improved and faster emotion recognition
system. LBP is conﬁgured as a preprocessing step to extract
facial features that is passed on to the BNN layer for successful
inference. The preprocessing method utilizes Viola-Jones (VJ)
algorithm to extract facial data while removing other background
information from the image. The LBP-BNN network is modelled
using Facial Expression 2013 (FER-2013) data set for training.
The custom hardware accelerator or the overlay is synthesized
and the designed IP is implemented on FPGA for the inference.
Inference is done using the trained model on FPGA to enable
faster classiﬁed results. Emotion detection using facial expressions
is classiﬁed to six states namely: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad,
and surprise. The LBP-BNN network is implemented in FPGA,
to realize a real time facial emotion recognition by capturing
the image of a person from a web camera interfaced to the
FPGA acting as edge computing inference device, with acceptable
accuracy. The image processing based emotion detection design
is highly suitable for other applications including tracking of
emotions for movement disorder patients in hospitals."

Approximate computing in general has garnered much needed
attention in the design community owing to high power saving
benefits, and at the same time quick generation of results. Approx-
imate computing as a design technique continues to offer design
advantages which is recently ceased by the ever decreasing technol-
ogy scaling. Approximate computing is mostly applied to arithmetic
designs, that has resulted in significant research interests. The pa-
per proposes a reliable and efficient approximate multiplier design,
that uses optimized lower part constant OR adder (OLOCA) de-
sign and hardware optimized approximate adder with normal error
distribution (HOAANED) separately as two variants. The two ap-
proximate multipliers derived from OLOCA adder and HOAANED
adder were found to be highly power and footprint efficient, and in
addition offers performance improvement over other approximate
multipliers. The error characteristics for the proposed multiplier de-
signs were evaluated and compared with the existing approximate
multiplier design. The proposed multiplier design along with the
existing ones were synthesized using 45 nm CMOS technology and
results were analyzed. The proposed approximate multipliers were
further explored for canny edge detection application, and results
for different standard images were found to be highly acceptable
showing 99.9% of outcome similar to exact multiplier design.

freedom (DoF) robotic upper limb to generate human-like motion for telerobotic applications. The developed architecture
encompasses a pipeline execution design using Blender Game Engine (BGE) including the acquisition of real human
movements via the Microsoft Kinect V2, interfaced with a modeled virtual arm, and replication of similar arm movements
on the physical robotic arm. In particular, this study emphasizes the integration of a human “pilot” with ways to drive
such a robotic arm through simulation and later, into a ﬁnished system. Additionally, using motion capture technology,
a human upper limb action was recorded and applied onto the robot arm using the proposed architecture ﬂow. Also, we
showcase the robotic arm’s actions which include reaching, picking, holding, and dropping an object. This paper presents
a simple and intuitive kinematic modeling and 3D simulation process, which is validated using 8-DoF articulated robot to
demonstrate methods for animation, and simulation using the designed interface."
116,Feasibility Study of using MyoBand for Learning Electronic Keyboard,"Abstract—Learning musical instruments like piano or elec-
tronic keyboard on average takes a decade. Currently, learning
an instrument requires continuous supervision from a tutor, and
it often becomes unrealistic to stay connected with the music
tutor for a long time. Online music learning platforms remain
unscalable as there is no way for these platforms to verify
whether user pressed a key note with the intended ﬁnger, which
is signiﬁcant for learning ﬁnger based musical instruments. To
overcome this, an autonomous system to evaluate and guide in the
learning process by continuously tracking ﬁnger movements via
a non-camera based solution is proposed. Finger press triggers
the muscle movements which are detected at the surface of
the forearm in the form of surface Electromyography (sEMG)
signals. The paper proposes tracking of ﬁnger press for 10
seconds on an electronic keyboard using MyoBand [1] wearable
device that provided 8 channels of sEMG signals. Eleven time and
frequency domain features of sEMG signals were extracted from
sEMG signals to classify musical note played by the instrument
on corresponding ﬁnger press. The feature set was standardized
using standard scaler approach, and vector dimensions were
reduced by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. The
resulting reduced dimension data was applied on Random Forest
(RF) classiﬁer to report best classiﬁcation accuracy for our
application. Experiments involved single ﬁnger press to render
a note in the musical instrument, and multiple ﬁnger press
to deﬁne chord sequence on an electronic musical keyboard.
Further analysis was performed to maximize the classiﬁcation
accuracy over the number of trials and optimize the position of
electrodes for successful identiﬁcation of musical note played. The
proposed method achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of 74.25%
for 5 musical note played on an electronic keyboard instrument
with 4 MyoBand electrodes, and an accuracy of 95.83% with one
electrode for identifying between four musical events including
two major chords sequence and two musical notes.

116,Decimeter Level Indoor Localisation with a Single WiFi Router using CSI Fingerprinting,"Abstract—The accurate localisation of multiple objects and
people in indoor environments is challenging. The problem is of
immense importance in the context of Internet of Things (IoT)
applications. In many scenarios, there is a high density of people
and objects which need to be spatially and temporally tracked.
As IoT applications ﬁnd increasing use not only in industrial
applications but also in novel areas such as healthcare in the
hospital settings, indoor localisation challenges need redress. The
paper addresses a novel technique for indoor localisation for
a resolution of 10 cm for Line-of-sight (LoS), and Non-Line-
of-sight (NLoS) setup. The received signal strength indication
(RSSI) based on WiFi signal is thoroughly studied in the past
and has offered localisation solutions, yet it is highly sensitive
to temporal and spatial variance due to multipath effect. The
Channel state information (CSI) signal transmitted from WiFi
hardware offers both space and time information, remains
relatively stable with multipath propagation and interference,
thereby the signal is considered highly suitable for designing
localisation techniques with precision. The proposed solution is
designed on an open source hardware, and CSI ﬁngerprinting
database for 100 locations that are spaced 10 cm apart for line-
of-sight (LOS) and Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conﬁgurations are
acquired to generate classiﬁer models using different Machine
Learning algorithms. Random forest classiﬁer model showed
localisation results of 93.15% and 98.01% for LOS and NLOS
respectively, for a resolution of 10 cm, which is reported for the
ﬁrst time. The design and technique can be further extended
to various applications including patients localisation in dense
waiting room of hospitals, home medical care, and other multiple
tools localisation in an industrial environment using existing WiFi
router infrastructure.

ABSTRACT 
 In this paper, we present “ThermoTrak”, a smartphone accessory 
based, 
real-time 
and 
accurate 
temperature 
measurement 
mechanism, which can be used to screen for fever, which is a 
manifestation of infectious diseases including the symptoms 
caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our system accurately identifies face 
and forehead region from a safe distance of one meter, calculates 
accurate temperature of forehead with accuracy of ±0.5° C on a 
linear scale. An AI based algorithm is employed for the purpose 
of accurately detecting the Region of interest (ROI) (Face & point 
near center of Forehead) and calculate the absolute temperature 
within 300 milliseconds.

117,A Platform To Enable Algorithms As Service Model Aimed at Digital Health Service Delivery,"Abstract—In this paper we provide a framework for Algorithm
As a Service Model which goes beyond Machine Learning as
a Service (MLAS) model, by supporting extended category of
algorithms including but not limited to measurement, calibration,
physics and statistics based models. These algorithms when used
for screening of health care data, are termed as Software As
Medical Device - SaMD. We present a platform that can act
as an accelerator for clinical trials of these SaMD devices. We
also go a step ahead from DevOPS model by semi-automating
the algorithm deployment process. We have deployed a few
algorithms into our platform and in this paper we discuss the
case-studies and illustrate the advantages of our approach over
conventional methods.

117,Heart Rate Monitoring Using Capacitive Touchscreen Sensing,"ABSTRACT 
According to World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of global deaths 
annually. More than 17 million people die each year from CVDs. 
To diagnose CVDs some clinical tests are required which are 
invasive and non-invasive both and are also expensive. Hence, 
there is a need for cheap, reliable non-invasive sensing that is 
easily available and can be used by layman. We are presenting a 
method that can harvest energy from touchpad for bio sensing. 
Today, almost everyone has a smartphone and its capacitive 
touchscreen can be used as a probable sensor for sensing vital 
health parameters. This paper presents the feasibility of 
developing a heart rate monitoring system using capacitive touch 
sensing. Tests were performed on six participants falling in 
different age groups. Scaled data collection could not be done 
because of coronavirus outbreak. Each participant underwent tests 
under normal heart rate and fast heart rate conditions. The 
experimental data obtained was tested in the frequency and time 
domain. Results suggest that the absolute error percentage in 
estimating the mean heart rate (beats.min−1) in the frequency 
domain is less than 5% for almost all the participants. The 
accuracy percentage for some participants in measuring the mean 
heart rate in beats per minute is 100%. The average mean absolute 
error (MAE) in the time domain is reported to be 3.83 beats. 
min−1 for participants enduring normal heart rate condition. 
Participants persisting with fast heart rate condition reports to an 
average MAE of 8.59 beats. min−"

117,"PIM2R: Packet interactive multi-media response for frugal, effective and scaled last mile connectivity","Abstract—Till date, despite of having a very high mobile
penetration, effective last mile connectivity is still a challenge.
This disconnect is primarily with respect to assimilation and
interpretation of online data. It leads to impaired economic
progress of society. One of the reason is illiteracy or semi literacy.
IVR’s do significantly good job in providing the information
to the user’s despite of their literacy level. However, IVR is
very capital intensive investment. To address this challenge, we
developed PIM2R framework. It is an IVR like framework
on mobile phone providing interface in native voice / text
language. This framework is analogous to soft switch and
offers internet scalable IVR capability. Significant efforts were
put for doing the user study and applying design thinking
principles to come up with standardized interface. Focus of
design was on Basic Emergent Users. In last few years, we
piloted few applications based on this framework in the field.
We present two representative case studies. First case study is
from telecom domain. We developed customer care application
and piloted with a large mobile service provider. We also present
an architecture integrating PIM2R framework in a typical mobile
carrier infrastructure. It was used by several tens of thousands
of customers and found it very useful. Second study is from
agriculture domain. We developed, Mandi price, an application
to provide real time trends data related to spot and future
prices of agriculture commodities to illiterate farmers. First
use case resulted in significant saving in customer interaction
cost. In second use case, since there were many variables, it
is really difficult to attribute saving by virtue of using this
application, however farmers were confident about the rates
and trend in soybean prices. They took informed decision
when and how much to sell. At present, modified version
of this framework is being used to service farmers in India.

Many capacitive sensing based biosignal measurements 
methods exist , which are generic as they do not personalize 
biosignal measurement 
. Further , are do not provide device 
agnostic solutions . A method and system for capacitive 
touch panel based biosignal measurement is provided . The 
method senses a change in raw capacitance value of a 
capacitive touch panel . However , unlike existing methods 
that directly utilize the raw signal for biosignal measure 
ments , the method disclosed derives a normalized signal by 
normalizing a raw signal corresponding to the change in raw 
capacitance of the capacitive touch panel . The normalization 
considers inter - relationships between a plurality of variables 
that affect the raw capacitance value such as a set of device 
specific parameters associated with the capacitive touch 
panel of the device , a set of ethnographic parameters , and 
metadata associated with the subject . Thus , method provides 
higher accuracy in biosignal measurement using capacitive 
touch panel based devices by personalizing the biosignal 
measurements .

119,Temperature Homogeneity under Selective and Localized Microwave Heating in Structured Flow Reactors,"ABSTRACT: Selective heating of diﬀerent phases of multiphase systems via microwaves can
result in energy savings and suppression of side reactions. However, materials properties and
operating conditions that maximize temperature gradients are poorly understood. Here we
utilize computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) computations and temperature measurements in
structured ﬂow reactors (monoliths) in a monomodal microwave cavity to assess the
temperature diﬀerence between the walls and the ﬂuid and develop a simple lumped model to
estimate when temperature gradients exist. We also explore the material’s thermal and electrical
properties of structured reactors for isothermal catalyst conditions. We propose that CFD
simulations can be used as a nonintrusive, predictive tool of temperature homogeneity.
Importantly, we demonstrate that localized heating in the bed under several conditions rather
than selective heating is responsible for the selectivity enhancement. Our results indicate that
structured beds made of high thermal conductivity materials avoid arcing and enable
temperature homogeneity and low electrical conductivity materials allow microwaves to
penetrate the domain.

ticles is essential. More recently, risers are gaining importance in some of the novel combustion
technologies, such as Chemical-looping combustion and thermochemical conversion of biomass.
These reactor conﬁgurations provide challenging modeling issues, as the particulate ﬂow is charac-
terized by a highly ﬂuctuating solid volume fraction due to the formation of dense clusters. This
may severely reduce the mixing between gas and solid particles and affect the residence time of the
particles in the reactor, and thus, the extent of heterogeneous reactions between gas and solid parti-
cles. In this work, we investigate how clustering impacts heterogeneous reactions in risers using a
detailed Euler-Lagrange computational framework. For this purpose, three-dimensional laboratory-
scale riser simulations are performed. A simpliﬁed reaction system is used, where the solid-ﬂuid
reaction is represented by a single isothermal reaction step. To asses the effect of multiphase dy-
namics of the bed on the heterogeneous chemistry, the three-dimensional simulation results are
compared with reduced-order models."

119,MULTISCALE MODELING OF BIOMASS ,"Abstract 
Biomass pyrolysis is a complex process that requires a multiscale modeling approach to accurately model 
the multiphase flow reactors such as Fluidized Bed Reactors. The particle-scale models play a critical role 
during the pyrolysis of thermally-thick biomass particles. This work implements a multiscale modeling 
strategy, coupling a 1D intraparticle devolatilization model, reduced secondary gas phase reaction 
mechanism, and CFD-DEM simulations. The significance of particle-scale models on the secondary gas-
phase reactions is assessed. To this end, we perform Drop Tube Reactor simulations in the temperature 
range of 973K-1273K using lumped and intraparticle devolatilization models. The secondary gas-phase 
reactions under these conditions are represented using a reduced chemical mechanism involving 39 
species and 118 reactions. The biomass particle size and physical properties are varied to gain insights 
over a wide spectrum of thermal regimes. The evolution of the primary and secondary gas-phase species 
along the reactor is compared between the particle models. Thermal and chemical time scales are 
calculated to understand the competition between the particle conversion and the secondary reactions. The 
analysis is then extended to study the variations in a Fluidized Bed Reactor, where multiphase 
hydrodynamics and chemistry are coupled."
119,Multiscale modeling of microwave-heated multiphase systems,"Abstract 
Modeling of microwave heating of multiphase systems requires resolving the electromagnetic 
field from the single particle to the entire cavity. We introduce a multiscale methodology for 
computationally affordable simulations of microwave heating of multiphase systems consisting 
of one phase dispersed in a continuum phase. The methodology homogenizes the original 
multiphase system, by taking advantage of the large separation of length scales, to calculate the 
effective permittivity, effective thermal conductivity, and volumetric power absorbed in each 
phase. The methodology is rigorously assessed against particle-resolved detailed numerical 
simulations of model systems. We demonstrate a significant reduction in computational cost 
while retaining the accuracy of detailed simulations. The present methodology enables high 
throughput exploration of novel multiphase system designs utilizing microwave heating."

essential ingredient to transport, focus and polarise neutrons over a wide range of energy. Here 
we summarise the recent developments of supermirror with very large critical angles of 
reflection and high reflectivity that were conducted at SwissNeutronics as well as their 
implementation in devices. Approaching critical angles m = 8 times the critical angle of natural 
nickel makes new applications possible and extends the use of reflection optics towards the 
regime of hot and epithermal neutrons. Based on comparisons of simulations with experiment 
we demonstrate future possibilities of applications of large-m supermirrors towards devices for 
neutrons with short wavelength."
120,Large bias-induced piezoelectric response in the ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) for MEMS resonato,"ABSTRACT
Piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics arises from electrostriction biased by their spontaneous polarisation,
which can be enhanced through a bias-induced polarisation. Doing so, the piezoelectric response
can be tuned and significantly enhanced. In this study, the ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) was
used to electro-mechanically excite a silicon microcantilever. Using this device, we demonstrate
that a bias-induced polarisation improves the piezoelectric response of P(VDF-TrFE). To distinguish
between the linear piezoelectric and quadratic electrostrictive effect, lock-in measurements were
performed in order to separate the characteristic frequency response of both electro-mechanical
phenomena. This work shows the potential for MEMS devices having controllable actuating and
sensing properties.

120,Potential of Piezoelectric MEMS Resonators for Grape Must Fermentation Monitoring "2279,"Abstract: In this study grape must fermentation is monitored using a self-actuating/self-sensing
piezoelectric micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) resonator. The sensor element is excited in
an advanced roof tile-shaped vibration mode, which ensures high Q-factors in liquids (i.e., Q ~100
in isopropanol), precise resonance frequency analysis, and a fast measurement procedure. Two sets
of artiﬁcial model solutions are prepared, representing an ordinary and a stuck/sluggish wine
fermentation process.
The precision and reusability of the sensor are shown using repetitive
measurements (10 times), resulting in standard deviations of the measured resonance frequencies of
~0.1%, Q-factor of ~11%, and an electrical conductance peak height of ~12%, respectively. With the
applied evaluation procedure, moderate standard deviations of ~"

120,TECHNICAL PAPER,"Abstract
Piezoelectric energy microgenerators are devi-
ces that generate continuously electricity when they are
subjected to varying mechanical strain due to e.g. ambient
vibrations. This paper presents the mathematical analysis,
modelling and validation of a miniaturized piezoelectric
energy harvester based on ambient random vibrations.
Aluminium nitride as piezoelectric material is arranged
between two electrodes. The device design includes a sil-
icon cantilever on which AlN ﬁlm is deposited and which
features a seismic mass at the end of the cantilever. Euler–
Bernoulli energy approach and Hamilton’s principle are
applied for device modeling and analysis of the operation
of the device at various acceleration values. The model
shows good agreement with the experimental ﬁndings, thus
giving conﬁdence into model. Both mechanical and elec-
trical characteristics are considered and compared with the
experimental data, and good agreement is obtained. The
developed analytical model can be applied for the design of
piezoelectric microgenerators with enhanced performance.

120,Silicon microcavity arrays with open access and a finesse of half a million,"Abstract
Optical resonators are essential for fundamental science, applications in sensing and metrology, particle cooling, and
quantum information processing. Cavities can signiﬁcantly enhance interactions between light and matter. For many
applications they perform this task best if the mode conﬁnement is tight and the photon lifetime is long. Free access
to the mode center is important in the design to admit atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, or solids into the light ﬁeld.
Here, we demonstrate how to machine microcavity arrays of extremely high quality in pristine silicon. Etched to an
almost perfect parabolic shape with a surface roughness on the level of 2 Å and coated to a ﬁnesse exceeding F =
500,000, these new devices can have lengths below 17 µm, conﬁning the photons to 5 µm waists in a mode volume
of 88λ3. Extending the cavity length to 150 µm, on the order of the radius of curvature, in a symmetric mirror
conﬁguration yields a waist smaller than 7 µm, with photon lifetimes exceeding 64 ns. Parallelized cleanroom
fabrication delivers an entire microcavity array in a single process. Photolithographic precision furthermore yields
alignment structures that result in mechanically robust, pre-aligned, symmetric microcavity arrays, representing a light-
matter interface with unprecedented performance.
Optical resonators are increasingly important tools in
science and technology. Their applications range from
laser physics, atomic clocks, molecular spectroscopy, and
single-photon generation to the detection, trapping and
cooling of atoms or nanoscale objects1–5. Many of these
applications beneﬁt from strong mode conﬁnement and
high optical quality factors, making small mirrors with
high surface quality desirable. Building such devices with
silicon yields ultra-low absorption at telecom wavelengths
and enables the integration of microstructures with
mechanical, electrical, and other functionalities6,7. Here,
we push optical resonator technology8 to new limits by
fabricating lithographically aligned silicon mirrors with
ultra-smooth surfaces, small and well-controlled radii of
curvature, ultra-low loss and high reﬂectivity. We built
large arrays of microcavities with ﬁnesse values greater
than F = 500,000 and a mode volume of 330 fL at wave-
lengths near 1550 nm. Such high-quality micromirrors
open up a new regime of optics and enable unprecedented
explorations of strong coupling between light and matter.
Scalable photonic technologies require optical devices
that are compact and can be mass-produced and inte-
grated, while maintaining high performance. Optical
cavities with high ﬁeld enhancement, small mode volume,
and narrow linewidths are of particular importance for
sideband-resolved light-matter interactions4,9, in transi-
tion selective photon sources10 or in nanoparticle cooling
experiments9,11–13. In a two-mirror Fabry–Pérot (FP)
geometry, these quantities are determined by the quality
and shape of the mirror substrate, its coating and the
mirror separation. Microscopic surface roughness and
deviations from a perfect parabolic shape cause scattering

of cavity light into higher-order modes and free space,
resulting in photon loss14. In addition, the cavity perfor-
mance depends on the mirror alignment; displacements
or tilts can lead to clipping losses. For many applications,
such as cooling or detection of nanoparticles, it is also
important to have free access to the optical mode. This
necessity is a geometric challenge in a microdesign with
strict alignment requirements.
To precisely manufacture low-loss silicon mirrors with
well-controlled
curvature,
we
use
a
complementary
metal–oxide–semiconductor compatible etching process,
as depicted in Fig. 1a. The mirror geometry, including its
curvature and depth, are carefully engineered by the
choice of parameters in a two-step dry etching process.
We achieved a surface quality approaching the atomic
limit by further applying a series of oxidation and HF-
etching
steps15
(see
Methods
and
Supplementary
Information).
The mirror chips are coated with high-reﬂectivity
dielectric layers (T < 5 ppm) on their microstructured
side and with an antireﬂection coating with a reﬂectivity
of ρ < 0.1% on the other side. Figure 1b shows a chip
containing 100 micromirrors, all with different curvatures
to demonstrate the versatility of the method. The same
coatings are applied to a set of planar silicon chips. These
chips allow us to realize two different cavity geometries:
plano-concave (PC) cavity arrays (see Fig. 1d), with a
minimal mode volume down to 330 fL, and symmetric
concave–concave (CC) cavities, with an alignment spacer
(see Fig. 1e) to optimize the light-matter coupling by
stronger mode conﬁnement at the cavity center.
For both conﬁgurations, we determined the properties of
the microcavity array by measuring the infrared trans-
mission through a single-mirror pair. By scanning a laser
(Toptica CTL) between 1520 nm and 1630 nm we mea-
sured the free spectral range (FSR) to determine the cavity
length L = c/2FSR, where c is the speed of light (Fig. 2a). In
the PC design, L ranges from 17 µm to 24 µm. In the CC
design, L = 140 µm – 160 µm and can be controlled by
choice of the thickness of the spacer.
From the frequency separation of higher-transverse
cavity modes (see Fig. 2a) we found that the mirror radii
range between 123 µm and 289 µm (see Methods). To
further assess the mirror quality, we measured the ﬁnesse
(F) of the individual cavities using both cavity ring-down
and sideband modulation spectroscopy. In the ﬁrst
scheme, a ﬁber-based acousto-optic modulator is used to
rapidly switch off the pump laser ﬁeld while the cavity is
locked close to resonance. The photon lifetime or cavity
decay can then be directly monitored on a fast photodiode

wafer. Plasma etching then creates concave shapes that still deviate from the desired proﬁle (dashed red line). A second, mask-less etch step enlarges
the central portion, thereby approaching an ideal parabola (green). We use a variety of aperture sizes in the initial etching mask to create a range of
mirror radii of curvature. The ﬁnal opening size is deﬁned by the concurrent vertical etch (blue arrows) of the ﬂat silicon surface. b A typical mirror
chip (dark gray) contains 100 micromirrors of different sizes and radii of curvature, with a square pitch of 500 micrometers. It is coated with a high-

(150 MHz bandwidth), as shown in Fig. 2b. Alternatively,
we used a ﬁber-based electro-optic modulator to imprint
well-deﬁned frequency sidebands onto the carrier beam,
which is then scanned across the cavity resonance. Using
the frequency separation of the sidebands we can directly
determine the cavity linewidth in a ﬁt to the transmission
spectrum, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2b.
Figure 2c shows the ﬁnesse of all 100 individual cavities
on a PC array, where the etch mask radius increases from
6.2 µm to 26 µm in steps of 200 nm from row 1, column 1
to row 10, column 10. Figure 2d, e shows that a high level
of performance is achieved for the entire array. Our
measurements yielded a maximum ﬁnesse of F = (5.0 ±
0.1) × 105 for L = 16.8 µm and R = 166 µm. This mirror
was formed with an initial mask opening radius of 9.8 µm.
This geometry results in a mode volume of only V =
330 fL or as little as 88λ3, while achieving an optical
quality factor of Q = ("

120,REVIEW Open Access,"Abstract
Beneficial effects of dietary phospholipids (PLs) have been mentioned since the early 1900’s in relation to different
illnesses and symptoms, e.g. coronary heart disease, inflammation or cancer. This article gives a summary of the
most common therapeutic uses of dietary PLs to provide an overview of their approved and proposed benefits;
and to identify further investigational needs.
From the majority of the studies it became evident that dietary PLs have a positive impact in several diseases,
apparently without severe side effects. Furthermore, they were shown to reduce side effects of some drugs. Both
effects can partially be explained by the fact that PL are highly effective in delivering their fatty acid (FA) residues
for incorporation into the membranes of cells involved in different diseases, e.g. immune or cancer cells. The
altered membrane composition is assumed to have effects on the activity of membrane proteins (e.g. receptors) by
affecting the microstructure of membranes and, therefore, the characteristics of the cellular membrane, e.g. of lipid
rafts, or by influencing the biosynthesis of FA derived lipid second messengers. However, since the FAs originally
bound to the applied PLs are increased in the cellular membrane after their consumption or supplementation, the
FA composition of the PL and thus the type of PL is crucial for its effect. Here, we have reviewed the effects of PL
from soy, egg yolk, milk and marine sources. Most studies have been performed in vitro or in animals and only
limited evidence is available for the benefit of PL supplementation in humans. More research is needed to
understand the impact of PL supplementation and confirm its health benefits."

Metal assisted photochemical etching (MAPCE) of 4H–silicon carbide (SiC) in Na2S2O8/
HF and H2O2/HF aqueous solutions is investigated with platinum as metallic cathode. The 
formation process of the resulting porous layer is studied with respect to etching time, 
concentration and type of oxidizing agent. From the experiments it is concluded that the 
porous layer formation is due to electron hole pairs generated in the semiconductor, which 
stem from UV light irradiation. The generated holes are consumed during the oxidation of 
4H–SiC and the formed oxide is dissolved by HF. To maintain charge balance, the oxidizing 
agent has to take up electrons at the Pt/etching solution interface.
Total dissolution of the porous layers is achieved when the oxidizing agent concentration 
decreases during MAPCE. In combination with standard photolithography, the definition 
of porous regions is possible. Furthermore chemical micromachining of 4 H–SiC at room 
temperature is possible."
120,Microsoft Word - ICNS 2009 - paper - Christian Schanzer - post review,"Abstract. Recently, we have developed an optimized process for polishing Al substrates 
leading to an extraordinary low surface roughness comparable to float glass of high quality. 
Indeed, supermirror coatings with R = 91% at the critical angle of reflection of m = 2 were 
produced demonstrating the excellent quality of the Al surface. Supermirror coated Al 
substrates open new options for advanced neutron optical devices. As one example neutron 
guides can start very close from the moderator. We investigated this option by Monte-Carlo 
simulations for i) a conventional, curved guide and ii) an elliptic guide. In case of i) an increase 
of flux at long wavelengths is obtained because of complete illumination of the phase space 
accepted by the guide. The elliptic guide starting close to the moderator (ii) has significantly 
enhanced neutron transport properties since only useful neutrons are extracted and transported 
to the sample. As a result such a guide concept is superior in terms of flux when compared with 
a conventional guide system and in terms of signal to background and well defined beam 
focusing compared with an elliptic guide starting at a larger distance from the moderator. In 
particular, experiments on novel materials, which are often only available in small quantities or 
samples under extreme conditions will profit from neutron beams of such high quality."

Interlayers at electrode interfaces have been shown to reduce contact resistance in organic devices. However, there still needs to be more
clarity regarding the role of microscopic properties of interlayer functionalized interfaces on device behavior. Here, we show that the impact
of functionalized electrodes on device characteristics can be predicted by a few critical computationally derived parameters representing the
interface charge distribution and orbital interactions. The significant influences of interfacial orbital interactions and charge distribution over
device and interface properties are exhibited. Accordingly, a function is developed based on these parameters that capture their effect on the
interface resistance. A strong correlation is observed, such that enhanced orbital interactions and reduced charge separation at the interface
correspond to low resistance regardless of the individual molecules utilized as the interlayer. The charge distribution and orbital interactions
vary with the molecular structure of the interlayer, allowing the tuning of device characteristics. Hence, the proposed function serves as a
guideline for molecular design and selection for interlayers in organic devices.

Devices based on organic semiconductors (OSCs) have enabled
several novel applications, such as flexible displays or wearable
sensors.1,2 Several n-type OSCs, such as Polyera ActivInk (N1400) or
P(NDI2OD-T2) (N2200), have enabled high performance electron-
transporting organic devices.3,4 However, the device current remains
limited due to the resistance at the hetero-interface of injecting elec-
trodes and OSC, known as contact resistance (RC).5,6 RC acts in
series with the resistance of the OSC layer and hence increases the
total resistance of the device. RC is reported to originate due to phe-
nomena such as pillow effects, defect generation, and the induction
of gap states, which accompany the energy level alignment process
during interface formation.7 These lead to the formation of an inter-
face dipole that hinders electron injection from the electrode to the
OSC.8 As a remedy, interlayers are inserted at the interface of OSC
and electrode, such as organic dopants or a self-assembled mono-
layer (SAM), in devices including organic field effect transistors
(OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) or organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs).9–11 Organic interlayers have been demonstrated
to effectively reduce the injection barrier and form ohmic con-
tact where the interlayer helps to decouple the OSC and electrode
electrostatically.12 It was shown that the presence of an interlayer
diminishes the effect of the attractive image potential at the inter-
face and eliminates the broadening of the density of states present at
the OSC-electrode interface while restoring Fermi-level alignment.
Polar interlayers such as SAM of polar organic molecules have been
revealed to reduce the energy difference between the work function
of the electrode (φ) and electron affinity (EA) of the OSC.13 This
reduces the energy barrier to electron injection from the electrode
to the OSC and consequently reduces the contact resistance.14,15
While studies have shown the effects of interlayers on energy level
alignment and device properties, the role of interactions among the
components of the contact interface has generally not been incor-
porated. Interestingly, it has been observed that the dipole moment
of SAM does not directly determine the contact resistance of the
device.16–18 On the other hand, it has been established recently that
orbital interactions at the electrode-OSC interface have a marked
effect on the contact resistance and device characteristics, the con-
tribution of which has generally not been considered significant.19
Orbital interaction at the interface affects the charge transfer rate,
possibly creating gap states and altering energy level alignment.20,21

In the past, first principle-driven molecular models have been devel-
oped to describe the effects of factors such as polarity on shifting
the work function of electrodes, interactions between inorganic and
organic components at the interface,22,23 and length and orientation
of interlayer molecules on resistance.24,25 However, to the best of
our knowledge, the ambiguity regarding the relative role of polar-
ity and orbital interactions in reducing RC remains unresolved,
and no computational models are predicting their combined effect
on RC.
This study aims to develop a model to predict the effect of inter-
layer functionalized electrodes (IFEs) on organic devices’ interface
properties and contact resistance. Previous models based on first
principles computations of SAM as an interlayer in organic devices
have attempted to study their characteristics by simulating a layer
of molecules attached to the electrode slab.26 We show that the sim-
ulation of molecular parameters includes sufficient information to
evaluate the efficiency of an interlayer in reducing RC, thereby less-
ening the overall computational cost. We consider injection based
on a hopping transport mechanism between the organic IFE and
OSC. We seek to quantify the physical phenomenon associated with
electron transfer at the interface. For this, parameters representing
interface polarity and orbital interactions were defined, and their
effect on interface and device properties was analyzed. We show
that the charge distribution at the interface and the charge transfer
integral of orbitals significantly influence interface and device behav-
ior. Parameters were computed within a first principle framework,
and the obtained results were validated against experimentally mea-
sured contact resistances of organic transistors and work functions
of electrodes functionalized with SAM interlayers. Subsequently, a
function was derived that could predict the effect of IFE on device
characteristics and interface properties based on parameters com-
puted for the particular interface, i.e., charge distribution and charge
transfer integral. Experimental studies performed by Boudinet et al.
on a variety of IFEs in the form of self-assembled monolayers
deposited on Au electrodes in devices of n-type semiconductors
were used to validate the model.27 In their study, various device
parameters are compared for SAM-functionalized electrodes com-
prising molecules that are aliphatic, aromatic, and with different
substituent groups (see Fig. 1).27 Contact resistance (RC) was mea-
sured by the transmission line method (TLM), which isolates the
electrical resistance at the contact interface from bulk OSC.28 There-
fore, the values of RC are the resistance to charge injection at the
interface. The correlation of the function with these device measure-
ments is demonstrated, asserting the combined effect of polarity and
orbital interaction in determining contact resistance and a method-
ology for rapid evaluation of the efficiency of interlayer-modified
contacts.
Density functional theory (DFT) based first principle compu-
tations were performed for the interface of IFE containing varying
SAM interlayers and OSC. A slice of the contact interface compris-
ing IFE and semiconductor was simulated. The IFE comprised an
Au layer bonded to aliphatic or aromatic thiol molecules (Fig. 1).
The position of the N1400 molecule (Fig. 1) next to IFE was opti-
mized according to distance and angular criteria. The stack was set
up with only a single molecule each from the SAM and OSC layers.
Simulating such a stack aims to study the intermolecular interactions
at the interface from first principles and understand their effect on
device behavior. Parameters computed from this stack are valid for

thereby, estimate the heart-rate information. The bioimpedance

bio-electrodes are placed on the forearm, where the current is
driven through the two outermost electrodes and voltage across
the innermost electrodes is measured and processed to obtain
the impedance plethysmography (IPG) signals. Simple electronic
stages for this electrode system has been carefully designed
and systematically evaluated. The proposed system has been
tested on 10 humans, 3 trials each. The maximum error of the
system in estimating the heart rate is 2 beats per minute (bpm).
The proposed technique serves as an alternative to current HR
estimation techniques by providing continuous HR monitoring
along with portability."
122,Resistance Network Synthesis for Analog Thermistor-Linearizer Circuits using Differential Evolution and Graph Laplacian,"Abstract—Thermistors are widely deployed for measuring
temperature in various industrial applications. A thermistor is
a compact, accurate temperature sensor with high sensitivity
and excellent operating range. The transfer characteristic of
the thermistor is a non-linear function. This paper proposes an
evolutionary algorithm based approach for synthesizing resistive
networks for analog linearizer circuits with minimum non-
linearity and at least a minimum sensitivity value. The approach
uses concepts of resistance distance and graph Laplacian matrix
to formulate an optimization problem. The equivalent resistances
of synthesized resistive networks are transformed into voltages
using simple opamp-based circuits. It is shown that the proper
choice of circuit parameters enhances the performance of the de-
signed linearization circuits. The parameters of the linearization
circuits are computed using a differential evolution algorithm.
We propose and compare multiple circuit topologies; the best
of which achieves a non-linearity of 0.4%, with a commercial
thermistor, in the range of [0, 120]◦C with a sensitivity of
2.8 mV/◦C."
122,An Interfacing Scheme with Improved Bandwidth for Multi-Current-Output Sensors,"Abstract—The 
paper 
presents 
a 
simple 
interfacing 
electronics suitable for a sensor system, involving multiple 
current-output sensors. The proposed interface selects and 
processes the individual sensor nodes, and then efficiently 
estimates the sensor-current and/or their combination. The 
novel design of the interface, which comprises an improved 
current-sense circuit, a switching logic and multi-regiming 
signal conditioner, renders many meritorious features. The 
salient features include improved bandwidth, reduced effects of 
ADC resolution, as well as the ability to provide customized 
design as per user requirements. The methodology and 
performance evaluation of this interfacing scheme is described 
in the paper. The test results, using simulation as well as 
hardware-based tests on a four-sensor system, demonstrate the 
performance of the scheme. The maximum non-linearity for a 
range of (10 nA, 160 nA) is obtained as 0.184%. The 
improvement in bandwidth is about 9.9 kHz (factor of 
improvement = 100). The working of gain regimes is shown 
adequately for single as well as multiple current output sensing.

122,Charge-Discharge-Based Digitizer for Resistive Displacement Sensor,"Abstract—Resistive transducers offer a simple, low-cost and
easy-to-use method for displacement sensing. Given these fea-
tures, resistance-based displacement sensors are widely used
in a number of industrial applications. This paper presents a
simple microcontroller-based digitizer, employing a novel charge
and discharge technique, for accurate digitization of a resistive
displacement sensor. The proposed digitizer utilizes just two
conversion cycles to convert the input displacement into a digital
format. As opposed to most of the existing digitizers that uses a
preset charging duration, the proposed scheme wisely configures
and employs charging periods to extract information related
to the measurement process. The output of the scheme is also
independent of pin resistances and internal reference voltages.
The paper brings out the working principle and performance
validation of the presented scheme. Experimental studies show
that the developed scheme can give good performance when
interfaced with a commercial displacement sensor, and the worst-
case error observed is 0.18 %. The proffered solution can serve
as a cost-effective and efficient digitizing solution for capturing
shaft displacements."
122,Improved Digitizing Scheme for LVDT: Design and Evaluation,"Abstract—This letter proposes an improved digitizing interface for linear variable differential
transformer (LVDT). The scheme excites the primary of LVDT using a sawtooth
waveform, and intelligently processes the resulting secondary outputs using a sim-
pliﬁed dual-slope-based circuit architecture. The proposed interface inherits all the
merits of underlying digitizing topology and provides a direct-digital estimate of po-
sition. The interface uses a low-complexity circuit, devoid of matched reference volt-
ages and high-quality resistors and several other special circuit blocks, and thereby
eliminates the demerits of the similar digitizers in prior-art. The proposed digitizer
also has low dependance on many circuits and sensor nonideal parameters. This
letter describes the design and analysis of this digitizing scheme, followed by its
thorough performance investigation using simulation and hardware-based tests. Test results evidence that the
developed scheme, coupled with a commercial LVDT, can provide accurate digital estimate of the shaft po-
sition. The nonlinearity error, observed during experimentation, is less than 0.5% over a span of 24 mm."
122,An Efficient Digital Readout for Four-Lead Resistance Thermometers,"Abstract—Four-lead resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are often
used to achieve accurate measurements in many industrial installations.
This letter proposes a triple-slope-based digitizing circuit for four-lead
RTDs. The proposed circuit not only provides the meritorious features of
its analog counterpart but also renders a direct-digital output character-
istic. It also ensures constant-current excitation, and the digitized output
is independent of lead-wire resistances and their mismatches. This letter
clearly conveys the working mechanism, as well as the performance veriﬁcation of the proposed circuit using various
studies. Results show that the maximum nonlinearity and relative error do not exceed 0.25% and 0.5%, respectively, for
the temperature range from −50 °C to 260 °C. Furthermore, the immunity of the circuit toward the noise is also good,
and its signal-to-noise ratio is around 46 dB. Later, the actual experimentation is also carried out using a commercial
RTD-Pt100 sensor. Results show the suitability of the developed interface for conditioning four-lead linked sensors."
122,Metrological Evaluation of a Programmable Gain Current-Sensing Digitizer Suitable for Retarding Potential Analyzers,"Abstract—Retarding potential analyzers (RPAs) are plasma
diagnostic sensors that are widely preferred in the aerospace
field for the study of space plasmas like the ionosphere and
solar winds. This article describes a low-cost programmable-
gain current-digitizing front-end for RPAs to be mounted on
spacecraft. The requirement of a controlled high-speed and
accurate measurement, considering the fast transit speed of
the spacecraft, can be met using the proposed scheme. The
circuit features a transimpedance amplifier as the primary
stage followed by a programmable-gain integrator. The gain
of the integrator is intelligently chosen by adjusting the
integration time based on the magnitude of the incoming
current. This enables the measurement of wide-range low-
current from RPAs with minimal effects of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization error with reduced response
time. The design and analysis of the scheme, simulation, and experimental results for a current range of ±(100 pA,
100 nA) is explained. The effects of offset errors of the scheme along with noise analysis were also reported. The
maximum observed nonlinearity from the experimental model was 2.77%. From the results and inferences, the proposed
scheme has been proven to work with RPA sensors. Recommendations for optimizing RPA operation, in conjunction with
the proposed digitizing scheme are also discussed."

lead-wire compensation, constant-current excitation, and requirement of
minimal number of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitization.
The first of the proposed circuits uses a twin-Op-amp signal conditioner
for three-wire sensor. This circuit is then modified to act as an efficient
front-end for four-wire resistance thermometer, and thus negate the effect
of lead-wire mismatches. The performance of the proposed circuits is
extensively verified using experimental studies. Results show that the
nonlinearity and relative error of the developed circuits is less than
0.05% and 0.32%, respectively, when tested with Pt1000 sensor. Finally,
a comparison study is performed to show the superiority of the proposed
techniques."

spanning over a wide range with minimal effects of analog to
digital converter’s quantization noise. The circuit also features
compensation techniques to account for offset errors due to
circuit non-linearities and temperature drifts. The error analysis
of the proposed circuit is also presented. The scheme was tested
for a current range of 500 pA to 5 µA. A nonlinearity of 0.534 %
was obtained from the hardware prototype. The circuit is ideal for
interfacing amperometric sensors in space applications, such as,
the Retarding Potential Analyzers and Langmuir Probe, where
high-speed measurement is required."

switched passive linearized network and a simple relaxation- 
oscillator circuit for digitization. The salient features of the 
proposed scheme include, 1) simple architecture for thermistor 
linearization, 2) direct-digital output, without requiring analog-to-

122,Studies on Linearizing Direct-Digital Converter Schemes for Thermistors,"Abstract—This paper discusses direct-microcontroller tech-
nique based linearizing digital circuits for thermistors. The
methodology of a basic digitizer, based on a single mode lineariza-
tion topology, is discussed first. An improved digital converter
with less non-linearity, equipped with dual mode linearization,
is then proposed. The resistor parameters of these converters
are optimized for non-linearity, using a differential evolution
approach. This algorithm converts the inherent constrained
optimization problem to an unconstrained one, and arrives at
resistor parameters for achieving best linearity. The performance
of both (single mode and dual mode) digitizers have been studied
using simulation and experimental studies over multiple tem-
perature ranges. Results show that dual mode digitizer provide
lower non–linearity than single mode counterpart. The measured
non–linearity of dual mode digitizer is 0.47% for 5°C to 45°C and
3.45% for an extended range of 0 °C to 120 °C."
122,Performance Evaluation of Simple Digital Measurement Platform for Remotely-Located RTD Applications,"Abstract—A simple and low-cost digital measurement system 
suitable for a four-wire RTD sensor is reported in this manuscript. 
The digital measurement platform suits for the linear estimation 
of the resistance of the RTD sensor without depending on the 
connecting wire resistances and their mismatches. In addition, this 
measurement system requires only four conversion cycles to make 
the output free from errors, related to the microcontroller voltage-
levels. The proposed measurement platform also has the privilege 
to select the comparator threshold levels. This makes the output of 
the circuit independent from the tolerance-related errors. The 
working of the digital platform is mathematically derived and 
detailed in this manuscript. Later, the effect of possible error 
sources is also analyzed. The methodology is verified using 
extensive simulation and experimental studies. A linear transfer 
characteristic is obtained during these tests, and the measured 
maximum nonlinearity is 0.38 %. Finally, a short comparison is 
also performed with the existing techniques for four-wire RTD.

122,Metrological Evaluation of Robust Relaxation-Oscillator Interface for Remote Resistive Sensors and Its Application Toward Realizing Few Industrial Measurement Systems,"ABSTRACT
A robust relaxation-oscillator-based conditioning circuit for remotely located resistive sensors
is proposed in this article. The proposed circuit uses a simple analog architecture comprising an integrator,
Schmitt trigger, inverter, and novel switching logic as its core blocks. The circuit provides a linear digital
indication of the sensor resistance. The output of the proposed circuit is independent of many nonidealities,
such as bias-current and offset voltage of Op-amps, connecting lead and switch on-resistances, and
mismatch/drift in the circuit components and power-supply levels. The proposed circuit has the capability
to render all these merits while interfacing with various types of resistive sensor configurations. The
working mechanism and analysis of the proposed circuit are described first in this article. The performance
of the circuit is verified using simulation and experimental studies. Later, the immunity of the developed
circuit from the effect of various parameters is also experimentally verified. Results show that the proposed
circuit possesses a linear digital output and generates a low error in the output. The maximum nonlinearity
is merely 0.14% when a typical single-element-based sensor is interfaced with the developed circuit. The
performance features of the developed circuit are also compared with the prior art and are observed to
be adequate for interfacing industrial resistive sensors."
122,Geometric Programming Assisted Conversion Time Reduction Technique Applied to a Multiregime-Based Digitizer for Wide Span Resistive Sensors,"Abstract— This manuscript proposes a geometric-programming (GP)-
aided approach for reducing the conversion time of digitizers for resistive
sensors. The digitizer, comprising a relaxation oscillator circuit, partitions
the sensor span into multiple regimes. An optimization problem with the
objective of minimizing the maximum conversion time for the multiple
regimes, while maintaining lower limits to ON and OFF durations,
is formulated. This constrained optimization problem is shown to be
a GP and solved numerically. Optimal thresholds for partitioning the
span as well as the optimal circuit parameters have been derived from
the GP-based solution. It has been shown that the usage of GP, in the
digitizer, can reduce the conversion time by at least a factor of three.
The performance of the digitizer, designed with GP solutions, has been
evaluated in simulation and experimental studies. Results show that
the digital interface circuit requires only around 17 ms during the
measurement range of 1 k–1 M and provides a nonlinearity of 0.2%."

In this paper a methane-fed internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell (IRSOFC) –gas turbine (GT) power generation 
system is presented. The system consists of one fuel compressor and one air compressor, two heat exchangers for 
preheating fuel and air streams, an IRSOFC stack, a combustor and a gas turbine. All these system components are 
modeled for predicting the overall performance of the hybrid SOFC-GT system. Further, a parametric study is 
performed to evaluate the effect of various parameters such as fuel flow rate (FFR), current density and compressor 
pressure ratio (CPR) on system performance. Results showed that the IRSOFC voltage, stack temperature and the 
power density increase with FFR. The cell voltage decreases with increasing current density and the SOFC power 
density initially increases with current density but decreases beyond a limiting value of 0.3 A/cm2. With the increase in 
CPR, the SOFC operating pressure increases but the SOFC stack temperature remains unchanged, therefore the cell 
voltage and power is not much affected by increase in CPR. The power produced by the GT however increases with 
increasing CPR, FFR and current density. The compressor work requirement also increases with CPR which however 
remains invariant with FFR and current density. The overall system efficiency of the system also increases with 
increasing FFR at fixed current density and with increase in CPR the efficiency initially increases and remains nearly 
constant thereafter. The overall efficiency of the hybrid system was found to be more than 50% for most of the cases at 
higher CPR and FFR considered in the present analysis. A comparison of the plant with and without the SOFC showed 
improvement in case of system efficiency of the hybrid cycle."
123,Aug-Oct'10 Engg.cdr,"ABSTRACT
Energy use is the basic criterion for the development of a country. India is a vast country and its electricity demand is high. 
But the per capita consumption is low which reflects its demand shortage and pushes it to a world rank of 156 in electricity 
utilization. This demand, however, could be met if the available renewable resources had been utilized properly. 
Sometimes it is thought that India's government policy for wind power is not up to par and India lags behind. If this is the 
trend, then other countries will surpass India in wind power growth and it will never become a wind superpower. Thus, the 
aim of this paper is to review India's wind power growth in comparison to other countries of the world."
123,High‐performance flexible temperature sensor from hybrid nanocomposite for continuous human body temperature monitoring,"Abstract
Combining high sensitivity with fast response and high resolution remains a
critical challenge for flexible temperature sensors. The present study leverages
the intrinsically high surface-to-volume ratio of nanocomposite fibers as well
as the high mechanical properties of nanomaterials for achieving conformable
temperature sensors with accurate and fast detection of temperature. To
achieve this, nanocomposite films of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) with embedded silver (Ag) nanoparticles were layered with multiwall
carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The sensor showed a negative temperature coef-
ficient (NTC) with excellent sensitivity of 0.18%/C and a quick response rate
of 11 s. The sensor also exhibited low self-heating errors for an activation cur-
rent of 1 mA and excellent anti-interference ability when tested for bending
forces and wet environments. The nanocomposite fiber-based sensor can be
used for real-time monitoring of human body temperature as confirmed by
successful experiments. The present work lays the foundation for integrating
the sensor further with a user interface to create a wearable temperature moni-
toring system for mobile healthcare.

Thin ﬁlm gauges (TFGs) are a promising candidate for measuring transient heat ﬂuxes in the
applications involving very short duration of heating environment. They are basically resistance temperature
detectors (RTDs) having the capability of responding in the range of few microseconds. In the present study, a
silver thin ﬁlm gauge (STFG) is fabricated and calibrated in-house with a view to assess the performance of
STFGs in dynamic environment. Convective heat load is supplied by a hot-air gun where the heated air jet
strikes the gauge and its response is obtained through voltage signal. Subsequently, the surface heat ﬂuxes are
estimated by using one dimensional heat conduction modeling. The similar experimental environment is studied
to obtain the ﬂow behavior of hot-air jet emanating into atmosphere by using numerical simulations. The self-
similar velocities are plotted as well as the interference of outer domain into the experiment parameters has been

123,Prediction of Experimental Surface Heat Flux of Thin Film Gauges using ANFIS,"Abstract Precise quantiﬁcation of surface heat ﬂuxes in
highly transient environment is of paramount importance
from the design point of view of several engineering
equipment like thermal protection or cooling systems. Such
environments are simulated in experimental facilities by
exposing the surface with transient heat loads typically
step/impulsive in nature. The surface heating rates are then
determined from highly transient temperature history cap-
tured by efﬁcient surface temperature sensors. The classical
approach is to use thin ﬁlm gauges (TFGs) in which tem-
perature
variations
are
acquired
within
milliseconds,
thereby allowing calculation of surface heat ﬂux, based on
the theory of one-dimensional heat conduction on a semi-
inﬁnite body. With recent developments in the soft com-
puting methods, the present study is an attempt for the
application of intelligent system technique, called adaptive
neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to recover surface
heat ﬂuxes from a given temperature history recorded by
TFGs without having the need to solve lengthy analytical
equations. Experiments have been carried out by applying
known quantity of ‘impulse heat load’ through laser beam
on TFGs. The corresponding voltage signals have been
acquired and surface heat ﬂuxes are estimated through
classical analytical approach. These signals are then used
to ‘train’ the ANFIS model, which later predicts output for
‘test’ values. Results from both methods have been com-
pared and these surface heat ﬂuxes are used to predict the
non-linear relationship between thermal and electrical
properties of the gauges that are exceedingly pertinent to
the design of efﬁcient TFGs. Further, surface plots have
been created to give an insight about dimensionality effect
of the non-linear dependence of thermal/electrical param-
eters on each other. Later, it is observed that a properly
optimized ANFIS model can predict the impulsive heat
proﬁles with signiﬁcant accuracy. This paper thus shows
the appropriateness of soft computing technique as a
practically constructive replacement for tedious analytical
formulation and henceforth, effectively quantiﬁes the
modeling of TFGs."

avoid the use of diesel generators in remote communities. The objective function is considered to
be the minimization of the total net present cost, including energy production, components setup,

proﬁtable operation of EVs and reasonable effects on renewable energy sizing, narrowing the gap

123,A woven wristband for spatiotemporal body temperature sensing for healthcare applications,"Abstract - Flexible micro and nano sensors are a highly attractive 
option for the monitoring of physiological parameters like 
temperature, respiration rate, heartbeat, etc. in the healthcare 
field. Smart textiles and wearables are one of the most suitable 
ways in which vital parameters of a person can be monitored 
continuously without severely affecting the comfort and health of 
the person. In this paper, a textile based flexible sensor has been 
developed to create a thin wrist band which can be used to 
monitor the temperature of the person wearing it so as to detect 
alarming changes in temperature like in the case of fever or 
hypothermia. The constituent materials and the weaving pattern 
have been selected so as to facilitate temperature sensing with 
high precision. Through a series of experiments in a controlled 
environment, the optimal number of strands, optimal weaving 
pattern and the optimal length of the fabric are found by varying 
the aforementioned parameters and calculating the temperature 
coefficient of resistance (TCR). The readings obtained from the 
sensor do not fluctuate vividly with the passage of time, which 
indicates that the readings are stable. From the change in 
resistance the corresponding change in temperature (from the

This work focuses over the performability analysis of a multi-server
retrial queueing model with phase-type inter-retrial times in cellular
networks. It is considered that the pattern of the new call arrival and
handoff call arrival follows marked Markovian arrival process. The ser-
vice times of both types of calls are phase-type (PH) distributed with
different parameters, and inter-failure & inter-repair times of channels
are exponentially distributed. For the prioritization of handoff calls, G
channels are kept in reserve for handoff calls. When all the available
channels, say S, are busy at the arrival epoch of a handoff call, the
handoff call will be dropped. Whereas a new call will be blocked
and will have an option to join the orbit of infinite capacity or leave
the system without getting the connection, if at least S  G channels
are busy. A new call in the orbit, termed as retrial call, retries to get
the connection after a random interval which follows PH distribution.
This model is analyzed as a level-dependent-quasi-birth-death pro-
cess by applying an efficient method. Through numerical illustra-
tions, the behavior of performance measures depending on the
various relevant intensities is discussed.

124,Resource optimization for MMAP[c]/PH[c]/S catastrophic queueing model with PH retrial times,"Abstract
A multi-server catastrophic retrial queueing model is developed in this study, which 
takes into account a controllable preemptive priority scheduling with phase-type 
distributed retrial times. For clarity purpose, the model operating scenarios that 
take place before and after the tragedy are termed as the normal environment and 
the catastrophic environment, respectively. In a normal environment, the inbound 
calls are divided into handoff calls and new calls. Controllable preemptive prior-
ity is assigned to handoff calls over new calls. In the catastrophic environment, 
when a calamity shuts down the entire system and all the operational channels are 
failed, a network of backup channels is swiftly deployed to resume services. Now, 
the inbound calls are classified into handoff call, new call, and emergency call as a 
result of the emergency scenario in the affected area. Due to the immediate impera-
tive to save lives in such circumstances, emergency calls are also given controllable 
preemptive priority over new or handoff calls. By establishing that the Markov chain 
meets the requirements for asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains, the chain’s 
ergodicity critera is established. Furthermore, the non-dominated sorting genetic 
algorithm-II (NSGA-II) approach has been employed to tackle a multi-objective 
optimization problem to determine the optimal number of backup channels and 
threshold values of preemption."
124,Power efficient stochastic modeling for Narrowband Internet of Things devices in 5G networks,"Abstract
Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) embodies the vision of connecting
virtually anything with everything and aims to support a massive number of
devices for small data transmission. However, an efficient power-saving model
for battery-operated NB-IoT devices is the need of the hour. In addition to the
legacy discontinuous reception (DRX) scheme, efficient beamforming helps in
saving device power. Moreover, the extended discontinuous reception (eDRX)
mode and Power Saving Mode (PSM) in Radio Resource Control (RRC) idle
mode enhances the effect of sleep while no data is available for the device to
serve. In this work, power-saving techniques for NB-IoT devices are studied
via stochastic modeling. This work proposes a semi-Markov model (SMM) for
beam measurement and beamforming-based DRX mechanism, in RRC modes.
The steady-state probabilities for the SMM are calculated using the two-stage
method. The numerical results show the effective contribution of efficient beam-
forming, eDRX state and PSM state in enhancing the power saving of NB-IoT

124,Resource and traffic control optimization in MMAP[c]/PH[c]/S queueing system with PH retrial times and catastrophe phenomenon,"Abstract
With the emergence of the internet and cellular networks, interest in using computer communication networks and commu-
nication systems has skyrocketed. However, unusual occurrences, like cyber attacks, power outages, network congestion,
equipment failures, etc. lead to abrupt changes in the state of the system and pose a signiﬁcant risk to these systems. Con-
sequently, some/all users can be promptly eliminated from the system. These type of scenarios can be well modeled by the
multi-server catastrophic queueing model (MSCQ). This article elaborates a MSCQ with the consideration of retrial phe-
nomenon and preemptive repeat priority (PRP) scheduling. For brevity, the working of system before and after the catastrophe
phenomenon is referred to as the normal and catastrophic environment, respectively. This study identiﬁes the incoming trafﬁc
as calls which are further categorized on the basis of the model operation scenarios. In normal operation scenario, the calls
are classiﬁed as handoff (HC) and new calls (NC). This study provides priority to HC over NC using PRP. Whereas, in the
catastrophic environment, when the calamity strikes, the whole system is rendered inoperable, and all types of busy/waiting
calls are ﬂushed out. To reinstate services in the concerned region, a set of backup/standby channels are quickly deployed.
In response to the emergency circumstances in the area, the calls made to emergency personnel are referred as emergency
calls (EC). Hence, in this case, the incoming calls are categorized as HC, NC, and EC. The EC are given priority using PRP
over NC/HC due to the pressing need to save lives in such crucial situations. The system is modeled by a multi-dimensional
Markov chain and by demonstrating that the Markov chain satisﬁes the requirements for asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov
chains, the chain’s ergodicity conditions are established. Furthermore, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II method
has been employed to deﬁne and address an optimization problem to achieve the optimal number of resources."
124,Resource optimization in priority queueing model with threshold retrial times and the preemptive resume policy,"Abstract
The ﬁndings of this article expounds a multi-server priority queueing model by taking into
account the preemptive resume priority scheduling and threshold based phase-type distribu-
tion (PHD) for retrial process. On the basis of priority, the incoming heterogeneous trafﬁc
is categorized as high priority trafﬁc (HPT ) and low priority trafﬁc (LPT ). When all the
channels are busy, an arriving LPT will be denied for the service, and it will enter the orbit
(virtual space) to retry after some time. The retrial process will follow PHD when the number
of LPT is less than some threshold value otherwise the retrial process will follow exponen-
tial distribution. One of the following two instances may occur when all of the channels
are occupied and a HPT enters the system. In the ﬁrst instance, the arriving HPT will be
discarded from the system if all the channels are packed with HPT solely. On the contrary,
in the second instance, the approaching HPT will be provided service by employing pre-
emptive priority when at least one LPT is receiving service, and that preempted LPT will
enter a buffer of ﬁnite capacity. Whenever an idle channel is found, the preempted LPT will
begin its service from the termination phase. The level dependent quasi-birth-death process
is used for the modeling and analysis of the proposed framework. By establishing that the
proposed Markov chain satisﬁes the asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov chain classiﬁca-
tion, the ergodicity conditions for the chain are demonstrated. For the numerical illustration,
the expressions of several performance measures have been developed. The non-dominated
sorting genetic algorithm-II approach has been used to address an optimization problem for
resource optimization and trafﬁc control."
124,Stochastic modeling for bandwidth part switching based DRX mechanism in 5G NR networks,"Abstract
The intensiﬁcation of mobile broadband services and user experience is explicitly dependent on the increased battery life of
user equipment (UE) and minimized delay in service. In 5G New Radio (NR), in addition to the Discontinuous Reception
(DRX) scheme, Bandwidth Part (BWP) switching plays a signiﬁcant role in reducing UE power consumption. The dynamic
bandwidth operation in BWP switching is power efﬁcient as UE can adapt its operating bandwidth based on the trafﬁc arrival.
In this work, BWP switching-based DRX mechanism is modeled as an M X/G/1 queue to trade-off between quality of
service and power saving in UE in 5G NR. Analytical and numerical results on the proposed model show it to be promising
in minimising power consumption and reducing delay in the service of UE."
124,Analysis of Power Management,"Abstract. Due to the increasing demand of the tethered high altitude
platform (HAP) systems, it is imperative to assess their power consump-
tion along with their deployment. This study considers the power man-
agement of lithium-ion batteries based tethered HAP systems for wireless
communications service provisioning. This article discusses a novel model
based on a multi-dimensional Markov process applied for the evaluation
of the power consumption characteristics of a tethered HAP system.
The proposed model takes into account the increment in the load on the
functioning of system after the consumption of power in batteries. The
underlying study introduces functioning of the system in three modes
along with the retrial phenomenon. The arrival of packets follows Marko-
vian arrival process (MAP) and the service time is phase-type (PH) dis-
tributed with distinct parameters in three diﬀerent modes. The station-
ary distributions and stability of the system have been derived using the
matrix-geometric method. Further, by deriving key system performance
measures, numerical examples have been illustrated."
124,arXiv:2107.07867v2  [math.OC]  31 Jul 2021Optimization of traﬃc control in MMAP[2]/PH[2]/S priority,"Abstract
The presented study elaborates a multi-server priority queueing model considering
the preemptive repeat policy and phase-type distribution (PH) for retrial process. The
incoming heterogeneous calls are categorized as handoﬀcalls and new calls. The arrival
and service processes of both types of calls follow marked Markoian arrival process
(MMAP) and PH distribution with distinct parameters, respectively. An arriving new
call will be blocked when all the channels are occupied, and consequently will join the
orbit (virtual space) of inﬁnite capacity to retry following PH distribution. When all the
channels are occupied and a handoﬀcall arrives at the system, out of the following two
scenarios, one might take place. In the ﬁrst scenario, if all the channels are occupied
with handoﬀcalls, the arriving handoﬀcall will be lost from the system.
While in
the second one, if all the channels are occupied and at least one of them is serving a
new call, the arriving handoﬀcall will be provided service by using preemptive priority
over that new call and the preempted new call will join the orbit.
Behaviour of the
proposed system is modelled by the level dependent quasi-birth-death (LDQBD) process.
The expressions of various performance measures have been derived for the numerical
illustration. An optimization problem for optimal channel allocation and traﬃc control
has been formulated and dealt by employing appropriate heuristic approaches."
124,Estimation of Mortality Rate of COVID-19 in India using SEIRD Model,"Abstract
In India, the number of infections is rapidly increased with a mounting death toll 
during the second wave of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To measure the sever-
ity of the said disease, the mortality rate plays an important role. In this research 
work, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated by using the Susceptible-
Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model. As the dis-
ease contains a significant amount of uncertainty, a fundamental SEIRD model with 
minimal assumptions is employed. Further, a basic method is proposed to obtain 
time-dependent estimations of the parameters of the SEIRD model by using histori-
cal data. From our proposed model and with the predictive analysis, it is expected 
that the infection may go rise in the month of May-2021 and the mortality rate could 
go as high as"
124,Numerical Optimization of Loss System with Retrial,"Abstract
In this study, we extend upon the model by Haring et al. [IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol. 50, 664-673
(2001)] by introducing retrial phenomenon in multi-server queueing system. When at most g number
of guard channels are available, it allows new calls to join the retrial group. This retrial group is called
orbit and can hold a maximum of m retrial calls. The impact of retrial over certain performance
measures is numerically investigated. The focus of this work is to construct optimization problems
to determine the optimal number of channels, the optimal number of guard channels and the optimal
orbit size. Further, it has been emphasized that the proposed model with retrial phenomenon reduces
the blocking probability of new calls in the system."
124,"Distributed Computer and Communication Networks: Control, Computation, Communications","Abstract. Several aspects of the new communication systems reﬂect the
ﬂexibility, coexistence, and diversity of 5G systems. Filtering communi-
cation window is a well-known method for generating desired Univer-
sal Filtered Multi Carrier (UFMC). Researchers are continuously devel-
oping new ﬁltering methods to reduce PAPR and OOBE produced by
the methods of traditional multicarrier in the communication systems,
due to the current need for new technologies in 5G communication sys-
tems. When it comes to wireless communication systems, the UFMC is
often viewed as the most signiﬁcant technology, this study contributed
in developing new ﬁltering method to attain a better match with current
necessities and requirements for new technologies. The proposed method
entails deploying pulse shape windowing and evaluating windowing ﬁl-
ters across multiple communication bands. Through assessment, this pro-
cess reduces PAPR and OOBE while increasing spectral eﬃciency. The
results showed the use of new ﬁltering methods outperformed the previ-
ous proposed method −70 dBm for the OOBE reduction and 10 dB for
PAPR reduction. It could be concluded that the new method produced
signiﬁcant results in UFMC systems, giving 5G wireless communication
systems a competitive advantage."
124,Empirical Analysis for Crop Yield Forecasting in India,"Abstract Several factors, including weather vagaries, possess a serious threat to agricultural crop production in India and
also are noteworthy risks to the economy. Crop yield depends on nutrition level of soils, fertilizer availability and cost, pest
control, agro-meteorological input parameters like temperature, rainfall and other factors. Further, each particular crop
needs speciﬁc growing weather conditions. Therefore, prognosticating crop yield is a challenging task for every nation.
Statistical models are the most commonly used tools to forecast the crop yield, whereas statistical forecasting model for
predicting dynamic behavior of crop yield should be able to take advantage not only of historical data of crop yield, but
also the impact of various driving forces of the external environment. This paper describes both the linear regression and
time-series models to predict crop yield efﬁciently and precisely. In particular, Bajra yield data for Alwar district of
Rajasthan have been considered for empirical ﬁtting of the models. Additionally, the selection of auxiliary variables, based
on the knowledge of crop growth stages, has mediated the outperformance of time-series model."
124,A mathematical model for supply chain management of blood banks in India,"Abstract
This work begins with the understanding of the fundamentals of blood banking by 
analyzing various aspects of its supply chain and then examines the current scenario 
of blood shortage in India. A mathematical model is proposed to curb the mismatch 
between surplus and shortage of blood units at blood banks. This proposed model 
has three main echelons: forecast the demand of blood units at the blood bank; deter-
mine the optimal allocation of units from blood banks with surplus to a blood bank 
with shortage; select the optimal route for the delivery of the allocations. Further, it 
has been shown empirically with the previous years’ data that SARIMA model is a 
very efficient forecasting methodology in blood supply management."
124,Perception based performance analysis of higher education institutions: a soft computing approach,"Abstract
In the tertiary education institutions, rankings have started gaining ample attention all over the world. This has created a
profound impact on the indian higher education system. As a result of that, in 2015, the government of India announced
National institutional ranking framework (NIRF) to rank the indian institutions. NIRF is based on multiple parameters which
are evaluated by standardised survey. In this work, a mathematical model, which can handle such multiple parameters to rank
higher education institutions (HEIs), has been proposed. In this model, six criteria, named as, student intake, faculty strength,
expenditure of the institution, research paper published per faculty, placements and perception, are considered. Since the
criterion perception is a qualitative criterion and can not be modelled by classical mathematics, fuzzy rule based inference
system is proposed to determine its precise value. Then DEA-Entropy-TOPSIS approach has been employed to rank HEIs.
To emphasize the applicability of the proposed method, a numerical illustration is provided. It is asserted that this proposed
mathematical model is a unique HEIs ranking approach involving human perception."

Nature's Real Estate such as water, minerals, oil & gas, and coal is

125,On the use of NSGA-II for multi-objective resource allocation,"Abstract
This paper investigates the problem of dynamic
subcarrier and bit allocation in downlink of Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiple Access (OFDMA) Systems. Using Singular Value
Decomposition, the MIMO fading channel of each sub-
carrier is transformed into an equivalent bank of parallel
Single Input Single Output sub-channels. To achieve the
capacity bound, one must solve a multiuser subcarrier
allocation and the optimal bit allocation jointly. To alle-
viate the computational complexity of joint subcarrier and
bit allocation, several suboptimal solutions have been
proposed. These suboptimal solutions handle subcarrier
and bits individually. We propose the use of Non-domi-
nated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-II, which is a
multi-objective Genetic Algorithm, for joint allocation of
bits and subcarriers, in the downlink of MIMO-OFDMA
system. NSGA-II is intended for optimization problems
involving multiple conﬂicting objectives. Here the two
conﬂicting objectives are Rate Maximization and Transmit
Power Minimization. The simulation results
indicate
remarkable improvement in terms of convergence over
previous approaches involving Evolutionary algorithms. At
the same time capacity achieved by the proposed algorithm
is found to be comparable with that of previous algorithms."
125,OptMem2101009Balakrishnan.fm,"Abstract—Health monitoring of an aero-engine assumes importance in the light of primary require-

craft engine health using Whale Optimization Algorithm based Artificial Neural Network (WOANN)
technique, for analyzing the data downloaded from the health and usage monitoring system (HUMS)
of a military aircraft. The actual engine data recorded during 47 different flights of eight different
engines (of the same type) have been considered in this work. Thirteen engine parameters have been
used to determine and monitor the health of the engine. The efficiency of the WOANN technique for
engine health monitoring, is compared with that of three other common machine learning algorithms:
Probabilistic based Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Back propagation
based Artificial Neural Network (BPANN). The results show that WOANN algorithm classifies and
predicts engine health far more accurately as compared to PNN, KNN and BPANN. The values
obtained for the metrics of Accuracy, Error, False Positive Rate, F1 score, Mathews Correlation Coef-
ficient, Specificity, Kappa coefficient are found to be the best for WOANN algorithm. The WOANN
achieved overall prediction accuracy of 95%, thus presenting itself as a very useful tool for day-to-day
monitoring of aircraft engine health using the data downloaded from the aircraft’s HUMS."
125,Bee colony optimization aided adaptive resource allocation,"Abstract
Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) is a promising technique, which can provide
high downlink capacity for the emerging wireless systems.
The total capacity of OFDMA can be maximized by
adaptively assigning subcarriers to the users with the best
gains for those subcarriers, with power subsequently dis-
tributed by water-ﬁlling. In this paper, we propose the use
of artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithm combined with
Deb’s selection mechanism to handle the constraints. In
this scheme, a probabilistic selection scheme assigns
probability values to feasible solutions based on their ﬁt-
ness values and to infeasible individuals based on their
violations, to allocate the resources to the users in down-
link
OFDMA
system.
Speciﬁcally
we
propose
two
approaches for resource allocation in downlink OFDMA
systems using ABC algorithm. In the ﬁrst approach, ABC
algorithm is used for subcarrier allocation only, while in
second approach the ABC algorithm is used for joint
subcarrier and power allocation. It is shown that both these
approaches obtain higher sum capacities as compared to
that obtained by previous works, with comparable com-
putational complexity. It is also shown that the joint sub-
carrier and power allocation approach provides near
optimal results at the cost of slightly higher computational
cost."
125,Multiobjective Subchannel and Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Two-Tier OFDMA Femtocell Networks,"Abstract—The cochannel deployment of femtocells in a macro-
cell network is a cost-effective and efﬁcient way to increase net-
work coverage and capacity. However, such deployment is exigent
due to the presence of inter- and intratier interference and the ad
hoc operation of femtocells. Motivated by the ﬂexible subchannel
allocation capability of orthogonal frequency-division multiple
access, in this paper, we consider the problem of joint subchannel
and power allocation in both the uplink and downlink of a two-tier
orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based femtocell net-
work. It is a multiobjective optimization problem that aims to
maximize the throughput of all users, simultaneously increasing
the power efﬁciency of femtocell base stations. Interference to
macrocell users is kept below a certain tolerable threshold. The
minimum-rate requirements of delay-sensitive users are also taken
into consideration. The problem is solved using nondominated
sorting genetic algorithm version II, and the results are compared
with the existing solution."
125,Genetic Algorithm Aided Proportional Fair Resource Allocation in Multicast OFDM Systems,"Abstract—The next-generation wireless communication net-
works are envisioned to offer many multimedia services such
as audio/video clips, mobile TV, web browsing, video confer-
ence, etc., with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements.
Multicasting/broadcasting has been recognized as an emerging
and enabling technique for such multimedia transmissions over
wireless networks. By employing multicast transmission, a base
station can transmit the same data content to several groups
of users requiring ﬂexible QoS. In this paper, we investigate
subchannel and power allocation problems in an OFDM-based
wireless multicast system. With the goal of maximizing the total
system capacity, a low complexity, novel genetic algorithm aided
efﬁcient subchannel allocation scheme taking into account the
constraints of total available bandwidth, proportional data rate
fairness and total transmit power budget at the base station is
proposed. The subchannel allocation is then followed by optimal
power allocation. Unlike previous work where either no fairness
or fairness based on number of subchannels allocated to the dif-
ferent groups was considered, we incorporate a set of system
parameters in the problem formulation such that the ratio of
the group data rates strictly follow the set of system parameters
after resource allocation. Simulation results show that the pro-
posed method obtains higher sum capacities while maintaining
proportional data rate fairness among different multicast groups,
without being awfully complex.

125,A study of ionospheric effects on IRNSS/NavIC positioning at equatorial latitudes,"Abstract
The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS/NavIC) is fully operational and broadcasting radio
signals at L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S-band (2492.028 MHz). When these signals pass through the ionosphere,
carrier phase delay, which depends on Total Electron Content (TEC), causes error in positioning. Corrections are
applied in the augmented navigation system to minimize the position error due to TEC; however, 100% removal
of error is practically impossible. Thus, a study has been carried out to understand the role of ionospheric
determinants, such as TEC and scintillation S4, on the accuracy of augmented navigation over low latitude
region using a dual-frequency NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) receiver installed at BITS-Pilani
K.K. Birla Goa Campus (Geog. Lat. 15.39oN, Geog. Long. 73.87oE). Data collected using the Indian Space
Research Organization (ISROs) NavIC receiver (make DataPattern) during the low solar period between March
2019 to December 2019 is utilized for this study. The important ﬁndings of the study are as follows: (a) Mean
position error was in the range of 2-4 meters. (b) Diurnal variation of the position error indicated a maximum at
afternoon hours, coinciding with the time of maximum TEC over the EIA crest region. (c) Mean position error
in afternoon hours indicated a linear relation with mean TEC, in a scatter-plot analysis. (d) Statistically, the
position error during the scintillation nights was found to be similar to non-scintillation nights, indicating that
the post-sunset equatorial density depletions during low solar do not signiﬁcantly impact navigation accuracy.
Absolute position error during the active phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm of 14 May 2019 was found to be
signiﬁcantly higher compared to a quiet period, which also depends on the mode of operation of the augmented
navigation system. It was found that a hybrid NavIC (Dual) + GPS (SBAS) augmented navigation was more
accurate than NavIC with Dual Ionospheric corrections or NavIC with grid corrections, alone. Besides, the
dynamic behavior of the ionosphere, i.e., diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations of ionospheric TEC, have
also been studied using the iono-delay values derived from the NavIC receiver."
125,Automatic Detection of GNSS Ionospheric Scintillation Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting Technique,"Abstract—Ionospheric scintillations caused by the ionospheric
plasma density irregularities adversely affect the positional accu-
racy of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver.
Machine learning methods are robust and efﬁcient for detecting
and classifying the ionospheric scintillation effects in GNSS
signals. In this letter, we propose an extreme gradient boosting
(XGBoost) based machine learning method to detect and classify
ionospheric amplitude scintillation, applied on a large global
positioning system (GPS) dataset collected from an equatorial
ionization anomaly (EIA) region, Sao Jose, Brazil (geographic:
23.2◦S 45.9◦W; dip latitude: 20.9◦S). The performance of the
proposed method is compared with a classiﬁer based on neural
network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree
(DT), and logistic regression (LR) methods. The confusion matrix
results show that the XGBoost method performed well, with
a prediction accuracy of 99.88% than other machine learning
methods. XGBoost algorithm handles the data irregularities
efﬁciently by setting a direction of descent through adaptive
learning and can subsample between the columns to reduce
the relevance of each weak learner. The performance results in
terms of F1 score, precision, recall, and area under precision-
recall curve (AUC-PR) indicates that the XGBoost algorithm can
characterize the ionospheric threats in GNSS signals to improve
the position accuracy."

125,Performance Evaluation of Tracking Loop under RF Interference using NavIC Software-Receiver,"Abstract—The Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) S-band
(i.e., 2492.028 MHz) signal is subject to interference from the unlicensed
terrestrial S-band sources. The performance of both code and carrier
tracking loops is degraded by external noise and interference leading
to degradation in Position Velocity Timing (PVT) solutions. Because of
its proximity to unlicensed S-band, the NavIC S-band is more prone
to radio-frequency interference (RFI) as compared to other navigation
bands. Therefore, in this paper, the effect of RFI on the parameters of
the tracking loop of NavIC S-band is analyzed using a software-deﬁned
receiver (SDR), and the results are presented. It is also shown through
simulations and real data that the effect of interference can be mitigated
by the optimized selection of tracking loop parameters like damping
ratio, noise bandwidth, and coherent integration time."
125,Carrier-Aided Dual-Frequency Vectorized Tracking Architecture for NavIC Signals,"Abstract—A
new
carrier-aided
dual-frequency
vectorized
tracking (CA-DFVT) architecture for the Navigation with Indian
Constellation (NavIC) is presented. CA-DFVT tracks both NavIC
L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S-band (2492.028 MHz) signals concur-
rently. It uses the precise carrier phase measurements from the
S-band signal and the unambiguous code phase measurements
from the L5 signal to form a new measurement model for
the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) to estimate the position,
velocity, and time (PVT) solutions. The new measurement model
takes advantage of the beneﬁts of the higher frequency S-
band signal, i.e., less ionospheric delay and carrier phase noise,
as well as the L5 signal’s inherent noise mitigation capabilities.
Compared to the single-frequency approach, the dual-frequency
approach in CA-DFVT eliminates the ionospheric effect and
minimizes other errors, resulting in better navigation solutions.
The proposed CA-DFVT enhances the reliability and robustness
of NavIC signal tracking and position estimation in interference
and high dynamics environments. We used static and dynamic
ﬁeld tests to validate the performance and robustness of the
proposed CA-DFVT receiver architecture. In comparison to
single-frequency (L5/S-band) vector tracking, the CA-DFVT

125,Composite differential evolution aided channel allocation in OFDMA systems with proportional rate constraints,"Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
is a promising technique, which can provide high downlink capac-
ity for the future wireless systems. The total capacity of OFDMA
can be maximized by adaptively assigning subchannels to the user
with the best gain for that subchannel, with power subsequently
distributed by water-ﬁlling. In this paper, we propose the use of
composite differential evolution (CoDE) algorithm to allocate the
subchannels. The CoDE algorithm is population-based where a set
of potential solutions evolves to approach a near-optimal solution
for the problem under study. CoDE uses three trial vector gener-
ation strategies and three control parameter settings. It randomly
combines them to generate trial vectors. In CoDE, three trial vec-
tors are generated for each target vector unlike other differential
evolution (DE) techniques where only a single trial vector is gen-
erated. Then the best one enters the next generation if it is better
than its target vector. It is shown that the proposed method obtains
higher sum capacities as compared to that obtained by previous
works, with comparable computational complexity."

allocation technique for multiuser Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We optimize both bit 
and subcarrier allocation by considering Rate maximization and 
Total Power constraint satisfaction. We solve them effectively by 
combining them into a multi-objective optimization problem. We 
propose using a Non Dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-
II) – a multi-objective optimization using Genetic Algorithm. 
Instead of combining many conflicting objectives into a single 
function, the NSGA-II uses multiple objective optimizations and 
brings out solutions which provide a better trade-off taking all 
conditions into consideration. The simulation results and their 
marked improvement over previous algorithms provide the basis

Many biological sources of sound in
tropical coastal shallow-water marine environments
remain unidentiﬁed. Characterizing the soundscape of
such environments requires that all sources of biolog-
ical sound be examined for their distinct patterns and
speciﬁc frequency ranges. The present study identiﬁed
soniferous ﬁsh in the ecosystem and measured under-
water ambient sound in terms of its sound pressure
levels (SPL) to quantify and characterize their contri-
bution to the soundscape. Underwater SPLs were
measured from 2012 to 2016 at a site near Grande
Island Archipelago (15 180 N, 73 410 E) 18 km off
the coast of the state of Goa, which lies along India’s
western coast. Acoustic data were recorded using three
types of methods for passive acoustic monitoring,
namely a hanging hydrophone, ﬁve seabed-mounted
hydrophones and an autonomous moored vertical
hydrophone. Underwater visual census at the site
revealed that both species richness and diversity were
high indicating the Grande Island Archipelago is a bio-
diverse site. The seabed-mounted hydrophones proved
to be the best choice for long-term SPL measurements,
although the moored arrays were more economical.
Ambient sound levels underwater varied markedly

125,Influence of domain experience on icon recognition and preferences,"ABSTRACT
With the advance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensor networks, accurate understanding
of complex data via interface icons is critical for eﬀective decision making, operation management
and monitoring. In order to understand how the diﬀerent domain experience among icon designers
and users aﬀects icon recognition and preference level among users, this paper takes
environmental and operational sensors as a case study and organises two icon design
workshops, in which icon recognition and preference tests are conducted based on the standard
ISO 9186 methodology. Results reveal that diﬀerences in domain experience among designers
and users do not impose a signiﬁcant impact on users’ icon recognition levels. However, users
new to the domain signiﬁcantly prefer icons created by designers who share similar levels of
domain experience with them. It provides a little reference for future environmental and
operational sensor Graphical User Interface icon designers, decision makers, scientists and
engineers to improve the icon design process.

125,Traffic Offloading Problem in Two-Tier Hetnets with D2D Support for Emergency Communication,"Abstract—In emergency situations such as catastrophes, the
cellular infrastructure can be partially or totally damaged. For
rescue teams to transmit and receive on-sight reports using live
video and high quality images, the provisioning of seamless
coverage with high data rates is inevitable. As cellular networks
continue to evolve into more heterogeneous structures regarding
the size of deployed cells, the implementation of trafﬁc ofﬂoading
strategies is essential to achieve high data rates and more power
saving. In regard to network modeling, stochastic geometry has
been considered in the literature as an efﬁcient approach for
modeling the locations of base stations (BSs). Moreover, stochastic
geometry provides tractable mathematical expressions for key
network parameters such as coverage probability and average
data rate. In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), density and
power of BSs in a given tier inﬂuence the volume of trafﬁc
ofﬂoaded to other tiers. However, these two parameters are
generally constrained together in practical scenarios. In other
words, given a BS density, the power per BS must be adjusted to
satisfy the inter-tier trafﬁc ﬂow to maximized system throughput.
Furthermore, in D2D networks the fraction of spectrum allocated
to D2D links also affects the net achieved throughput. In this
paper, we formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the power
of small BSs (SBSs), SBS density, and the fraction of spectrum
allocated for D2D communications in order to maximize system
throughput for critical conditions such as rescue missions."
126,1,"Abstract 
Anomaly detection in videos is challenging due to the complexity, noise, and diverse nature of 
activities such as violence, shoplifting, and vandalism. While deep learning (DL) has shown excellent 
performance in this area, existing approaches have struggled to apply DL models across different 
anomaly tasks without extensive retraining. This repeated retraining is time-consuming, 
computationally intensive, and unfair. To address this limitation, a new DL framework is introduced 
in this study, consisting of three key components: transfer learning to enhance feature generalization, 
model fusion to improve feature representation, and multi-task classification to generalize the classifier 
across multiple tasks without training from scratch when new task is introduced. The framework's 
main advantage is its ability to generalize without requiring retraining from scratch for each new task. 
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving an accuracy of 97.99% 
on the RLVS dataset (violence detection), 83.59% on the UCF dataset (shoplifting detection), and 
88.37% across both datasets using a single classifier without retraining. Additionally, when tested on 
an unseen dataset, the framework achieved an accuracy of 87.25%. The study also utilizes two 
explainability tools to identify potential biases, ensuring robustness and fairness. This research 
represents the first successful resolution of the generalization issue in anomaly detection, marking a 
significant advancement in the field."

Image encryption algorithms have recently been developed to protect data from hackers 
and give recipients privacy. DES is a widely recognized block cypher that has certain 
vulnerabilities that make it susceptible to differential attacks. The present is a lightweight 
symmetric algorithm that provides privacy for transferring information over the network 
but has some drawbacks in that it is difficult to maintain an appropriate level of 
complexity. The study suggests that to encrypt and decrypt images as quickly as possible, 
the system uses parallel environments in algorithms (Present and DES). It also uses a 2D-
Chaotic key generation system to make the system stronger against statistical, differential, 
and brute force attacks. Where the DES algorithm uses four rounds, within each one round 
from the des, the present algorithm executes only four rounds, and the same 2D-Chaotic 
System is used to generate the key. The keys and blocks are distributed to 4 cores, 5 cores, 
or 6 cores at the same time. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is 
quantified by several metrics: All peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values are low, which 
means the quality image encryption is good. Unlike MSE, all the values are very high, 
which indicates that the image we have encrypted has no similarity to the encrypted 
image. The NPCR value of 99.6658% indicates a high degree of accuracy in changing 
pixel values. Additionally, a unified average changing intensity (UACI) that doesn't go 
over 30.90% shows that the algorithm is good at making big changes in pixel intensities. 
And the analysis speed of the proposed system based on the parallelism of the 
environment is faster than the sequence algorithms (DES-Present). The results 
demonstrate the algorithm's ability to encrypt color images, making it useful in 
applications that require strong data and image security."

126,Novel Deep Feature Fusion Framework for Multi-Scenario Violence Detection,"Abstract: Detecting violence in various scenarios is a difﬁcult task that requires a high degree of
generalisation. This includes ﬁghts in different environments such as schools, streets, and foot-
ball stadiums. However, most current research on violence detection focuses on a single scenario,
limiting its ability to generalise across multiple scenarios. To tackle this issue, this paper offers a
new multi-scenario violence detection framework that operates in two environments: ﬁghting in
various locations and rugby stadiums. This framework has three main steps. Firstly, it uses transfer
learning by employing three pre-trained models from the ImageNet dataset: Xception, Inception, and
InceptionResNet. This approach enhances generalisation and prevents overﬁtting, as these models
have already learned valuable features from a large and diverse dataset. Secondly, the framework
combines features extracted from the three models through feature fusion, which improves feature
representation and enhances performance. Lastly, the concatenation step combines the features of the
ﬁrst violence scenario with the second scenario to train a machine learning classiﬁer, enabling the
classiﬁer to generalise across both scenarios. This concatenation framework is highly ﬂexible, as it
can incorporate multiple violence scenarios without requiring training from scratch with additional
scenarios. The Fusion model, which incorporates feature fusion from multiple models, obtained
an accuracy of 97.66% on the RLVS dataset and 92.89% on the Hockey dataset. The Concatenation
model accomplished an accuracy of 97.64% on the RLVS and 92.41% on the Hockey datasets with
just a single classiﬁer. This is the ﬁrst framework that allows for the classiﬁcation of multiple violent
scenarios within a single classiﬁer. Furthermore, this framework is not limited to violence detection
and can be adapted to different tasks."

importance in affecting the network stability and prolonging its lifetime. The adoption of a protocol that manage energy

has contributed significantly in reducing the consumed energy in the entire network, improving network performance and 
extending network lifetime. If we compare MVFGWO with the best similar routing protocols. 
The practical results showed the superiority of the proposed protocol over the rest of the best routing protocols that were

WoT has become one of the important fields that accompanied the development of technology in the present 
day, so that its income in all areas of work, including (industrial, agricultural, medical, industrial, etc.). This 
proliferation generated fears among users of the growing use of WoT without providing safe ways to preserve 
the information generated by its devices. So, many ways to maintain the security of data as well as integrity, 
through the use of light weight speed algorithms to encrypt and to validate the parameters that may be used 
in this area. In the field of information authentication, many algorithms have emerged that help to ensure the 
authenticity of information generated when sent from physical sensors to the user environment. These include 
SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, etc. In WoT, the speed of encryption and authentication must be an important 
requirement and a duty to ensure the validity of the information and to continue monitoring the data. 
Therefore, providing fast algorithms is an important requirement to be provided with WoT. In this paper, a 
modification of the SHA-3 algorithm will be introduced by replacing the KECCAK function with another 
very fast algorithm which is SPECK which is produced a very fast algorithm with a reliable strong level of 
security in the data validation process produced by sensors. Also, the extended logistic system will be used 
to generate the initial values that the SHA3 algorithm uses to make these values unknown and which the 
intruder cannot guess or recognize."

127,A Low-Temperature Hybrid Bonding Using Copper and Parylene for Heterogeneous Integration,"Abstract— This work demonstrates a low-temperature hybrid
bonding integrating copper and Parylene-C for 3-D integration.
The Parylene was deposited using a chemical vapor deposition
process over electroplated copper bumps followed by chemical
mechanical
polishing
(CMP)
to
planarize
copper/parylene
topology and flatten the roughness of a copper surface. The
parylene shows a higher tolerance for height topology and
surface roughness. The recrystallization of the parylene was
performed at 250 ◦C for 30 min prior to bonding. The copper
and parylene materials are then bonded simultaneously at
300 ◦C. A homogenous bond of copper to copper and parylene
to parylene bonding interface without any significant bonding
voids was obtained. The tensile and shear bond strength of
the bond interface was evaluated using a universal testing
machine (UTM) and showed improved strength compared to
bonding them separately. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis ensures
parylene’s thermal stability up to 490 ◦C, making the substance
appropriate for IC packaging. The developed hybrid bonding is
well suited for 2.5 and 3-D heterogeneous integration.

127,Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon Dots Derived from Camel Milk for Mn7+ Sensing and Antiamyloid and Anticancer Activities,"ABSTRACT: Carbon dots (CDs) are promising biocompatible fluorescent
nanoparticles mainly used in bioimaging, drug delivery, sensing,
therapeutics, and various other applications. The utilization of natural
sources and green synthetic approaches is resulting in highly biocompatible
and nontoxic nanoparticles. Herein, we report an unprecedented facile and
green synthesis of highly luminescent carbon dots derived from camel milk
(CM) for sensing manganese (Mn7+) ions and for identifying the
anticancer potential and antiamyloid activity against α-synuclein amyloids.
α-Synuclein amyloid formation due to protein misfolding (genetic and
environmental factors) has gained significant attention due to its
association with Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. The as-
synthesized CM-CDs possess an average hydrodynamic diameter ranging
from 3 to 15 nm and also exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) emission
in the blue region. The CM-CDs possess good water dispersibility, stable fluorescence under different physical states, and
outstanding photostability. Moreover, the CM-CDs are validated as an efficient sensor for the detection of Mn7+ ions in DI water
and in metal ion-polluted tap water. In addition, the CM-CDs have demonstrated a very good quantum yield (QY) of 24.6% and a
limit of detection (LOD) of 0.58 μM for Mn7+ ions with no incubation time. Consequently, the exceptional properties of CM-CDs
make them highly suitable for a diverse array of biomedical applications."

sensors research community due to interference signal from the food matrix. In this letter, an optical nanosensing platform
to rapidly detect traces of paraquat pesticide in honey is reported. To eliminate the signal interference from honey matrix,
Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method was employed to isolate paraquat from honey.
The QuEChERS method improved the sensor efﬁcacy and enabled the detection of paraquat with limit of detection (LOD)
as low as 0.075 mg/kg (75 ppb) in honey. The Raman signal intensity at 1648 cm−1 peak showed a linear relationship

127,Prediction of Insurance Premium using Machine Learning with an Adaptive Approach,"Abstract—The insurance market is very large and expanding 
day by day. There are many parameters to consider before 
deciding on insurance premiums. Sometimes it becomes difficult 
to browse all the documents before applying for insurance, so it 
is necessary to understand the insurance industry and point out 
issues related to competition in that industry. This type of 
company is very interested in forecasting. The goal of this article 
is to find accurate predictions based on considering different 
dimensions of machine learning to reduce the company's 
financial losses. Machine learning helps companies to optimize 
their services with greater accuracy and fewer losses. It can also 
help insurance companies effectively screen cases, evaluate them 
more accurately, and make accurate cost forecasts. This 
research work uses machine learning-based methods like linear 
regression, KStar, and Random Forest and suggests a suitable 
method to produce results with high accuracy and less relative 
error.  In addition to this, it demonstrates how to create a 
specific data subset that can be used to test and train a machine 
learning system. The effectiveness of the suggested strategy is 
assessed by contrasting the estimated value with the actual value 
of the simulated data. Insurance firms are capable to construct 
consistent financial structures, such as monthly premiums or 
payroll taxes, to provide funds to pay for the medical benefit 
agreements that are defined in insurance policies by calculating 
the whole risk of the expenses associated with health care and 
the medical system."
127,A Thin Film Porous Alumina Vacuum Package Utilizing a Pore Sealing Getter,"Abstract— This work reports a thin-film encapsulated package
with porous alumina as the capping layer and titanium as a pore-
sealing getter. The titanium-gold film seals the thin film package
and acts as the getter. Since the getter is not exposed to the
elements, fouling of the getter is prevented. EDX measurements
confirm that the getter material did not penetrate the package
through the nanopores. The process is a low thermal budget
process, with the getter activation (300 ◦C for 1 hour) being
the only step where the temperature is raised. A Silicon Pirani
gauge was used to monitor the pressure changes inside the sealed
cavity. After the getter activation, a decrease in the pressure
from 50 µTorr to 3.9 µTorr was seen for the first few days, and
no noticeable change afterward. The hermeticity of the thin-
film encapsulated package was examined, and the vacuum level
inside the package remained the same for the last 510 days.
In addition to providing a stable hermetic package, the getter
may be activated in-circuit by resistive heating in case of pressure
increases after many years of operation.

humans, but an excess amount of copper creates liver 
toxicity, as the environment protection agency (EPA) 
reported. In this paper, an anodized porous alumina 
membrane has been used to remove excess copper ions from 
water samples between 10 nM to 1 mM concentration range 
by adsorption of the ions in the nanopores. The results have 
been verified by monitoring the change in current for 
different concentrations of copper ions in water samples 
using chronoamperometry at a very low potential value. 
This device can also remove excess copper ions at the surface 
levels of water bodies just by using a miniaturized device 
array and a potential source. Using a square wave 
voltammetry process, the device can be reused after 
stripping the pre-deposited ions."
127,Salivary Analysis for Evidence based Ayurvedic Diagnosis,"Abstract— Ayurveda is called Mother of all medical sciences. 
It’s the oldest therapeutic and medicinal treatment invented in 
ancient India. Ayurveda or Ayurvedic treatment is bit 
different from modern medical science. It believes in Nadi 
Pariksha and many subjective parameters are included to start 
diagnosis of disease. Whereas modern medical science has 
different approach of disease diagnosis. It utilizes different 
tools and testing to diagnose a disease effectively. Saliva 
analysis is already accepted in modern medical as an important 
bio-substance, as we see in COVID-19, but not in ayurveda. 
This paper shows how salivary analysis can act as an evidential 
proof for diagnosing a disease, in the ayurvedic way. The 
salivary contents can be analyzed use various biosensors. One 
of these is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) 
platform. It allows molecular detection in bio fluids like saliva, 
sweat, urine, etc. The saliva analysis using SERS technique will 
help to detect various trace level molecules which is likely to 
assist the Ayurvedic 
diagnosis 
more 
accurately and 
dependency on subjective parameters will reduce to evaluate 
patient’s condition."
127,Trace Level Molecular Detection in Organic Honey Relevant for Therapeutic Applications,"Abstract—Honey is used for therapeutic applications, for a

with the presence of phenolics, enzymes, flavonoids, 
carbohydrates, organic acids, terpenes, proteins and pollens 
etc. The direct or indirect additions of honey with sugar 
syrups, antibiotics or pesticides reduces its nutritional as 
well as therapeutic value. In this work, we have utilized our 
in house developed sensor to perform quality assessment of 
two different honey samples and could distinguish high 
quality organic honey from ordinary honey. Both honey 
samples were also tested for presence of chloramphenicol 
which is a commonly used antibiotic in India."

127,A woven wristband for spatiotemporal body temperature sensing for healthcare applications,"Abstract - Flexible micro and nano sensors are a highly attractive 
option for the monitoring of physiological parameters like 
temperature, respiration rate, heartbeat, etc. in the healthcare 
field. Smart textiles and wearables are one of the most suitable 
ways in which vital parameters of a person can be monitored 
continuously without severely affecting the comfort and health of 
the person. In this paper, a textile based flexible sensor has been 
developed to create a thin wrist band which can be used to 
monitor the temperature of the person wearing it so as to detect 
alarming changes in temperature like in the case of fever or 
hypothermia. The constituent materials and the weaving pattern 
have been selected so as to facilitate temperature sensing with 
high precision. Through a series of experiments in a controlled 
environment, the optimal number of strands, optimal weaving 
pattern and the optimal length of the fabric are found by varying 
the aforementioned parameters and calculating the temperature 
coefficient of resistance (TCR). The readings obtained from the 
sensor do not fluctuate vividly with the passage of time, which 
indicates that the readings are stable. From the change in 
resistance the corresponding change in temperature (from the 
body temperature for which the fabric is calibrated for) is 
calculated on the basis of TCR."

127,Rapid Detection of Inflammatory Biomarkers using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy,"Abstract—Cytokines are biomarkers of inflammation which 
are used for disease diagnosis and to understand disease 
progression. The key pro-inflammatory cytokines released by 
the inflammatory cells include IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. The 
quantification of cytokines is crucial due to their clinical 
significance in physiological and pathological aspects of 
inflammatory diseases. To overcome the limitations of 
existing methods which are immunoassay-based, used to 
detect and analyze the cytokines, the technique of Surface 
Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is used. This is a 
highly sensitive technique which can be used to detect samples 
even at low concentrations. The rapid detection of cytokines 
simultaneously can be achieved by enhancing the Raman 
signal using SERS. Each individual cytokine stock solution 
was deposited on the SERS substrate prepared and analyzed 
using a Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra obtained 
are expected to contain all the characteristic peaks of the 
sample, similar to the literature data. To further enhance the 
Raman signals, gold nanoparticles or gold nanorod solutions 
were added along with the cytokines onto the substrate."

µm and placed above the capping layer. The package was 
sealed at 50 µTorr pressure using evaporated aluminum 
oxide. A glow discharge is formed in the cavity when a 
voltage >800V is applied at room temperature. The 
sputtered titanium from the discharge reacts with available

127,A non-invasive ultrasensitive diagnostic approach for COVID-19 infection using salivary label-free SERS fingerprinting and artificial intelligence,"abstracted from the label-free analysis of bio­
molecules can be decoded, segregated, and effectively managed with the 
aid of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. 
Computer-aided chemometric approach for the design of classification 
and prediction models with the biological data of spectroscopic studies 
have previously been established for a range of applications like disease 
diagnosis and prognosis, proteomics, genomics, metabolomics and 
evaluation of therapy [12]. 
The purpose of the current investigation was to explore the feasibility 
of employing SERS as a diagnostic modality for the label-free discrimi­
nation of SARS-CoV-2 infection from saliva samples. Portable hand-held 
Raman spectrophotometer has been utilized to secure the Raman fin­
gerprints from the saliva samples where colloidal AuNPs was mixed with 
saliva in order to evaluate the enhanced Raman peaks. The classification 
models built-up by machine learning and deep learning algorithms 
based on salivary SERS spectra that will ensure high accuracy, speci­
ficity, and sensitivity to the approach. Considering the significant 
damage created by several waves of COVID viral transmission and the 
prediction for future outbreaks, an alternative strategy for diagnosis in a 
non-invasive manner with high accuracy is demanded to ensure mass 
population screening to effectually tame the next wave. Here, we aim to 
develop a portable, fast, and highly sensitive technique for the identi­
fication of COVID-19 infection by label-free surface enhanced Raman 
spectral analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) for the iden­
tification of unique bio-molecular Raman fingerprints of COVID-19 
infection in the body fluids like saliva and classify the healthy and 
COVID-19 infected samples using trained support vector machine (SVM) 
classifier. Hence, we believe that our current approach (Scheme 1) will 
certainly be translated to the bedside application after a large cohort 
study in a time-bound manner. 
2. Experimental Methods 
Synthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles. Gold nano­
particles (AuNPs) were synthesized by the citrate reduction method as 
described previously [13]. All glassware were cleaned with aqua regia, 
then rinsed and steeped in Milli-Q water before use. Briefly, MilliQ water 
(50 mL) was heated until boiling to which 50 μL gold chloride (0.25 M) 
was added. After 10 min of boiling, 125 μL of trisodium citrate solution 
(0.1 M) was added which resulted in a color change from purple to red in 
5 min. The solution was allowed to cool for about 90 min with constant 
stirring. The as-prepared nanoparticles were concentrated by centrifu­
gation for 45 min at 4000 rpm for SERS analysis. Later the size, shape, 
and monodispersity of the prepared AuNPs were confirmed by 
ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering 
(DLS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). 
Optimization of SERS studies. SERS experiments were performed 
with the aid of a handheld Raman spectroscope (Metrohm, USA) with a 
laser beam of 785 nm at 6 mW power directed to the sample through 
collection optics termed universal attachment (6.07506.010) with a 
numerical aperture (NA = 0.50 mm working distance and 0.2–2.5 mm 
spot size). Position 2 in the universal attachment was used for the study 
which is approximately 3 mm from the end of the attachment. The 
spectral resolution was 8–10 cm−1 (FWHM) with beam divergence 2◦. 
The detection technique was Orbital Raster Scan (ORS) to average over 
the sample. The laser class was 3B according to EN 60825–"

on the top of a Bragg’s reﬂector structure (Bragg’s reﬂector is composed by placing high and low acoustic impedance
materials placed on one over another) and this Bragg’s reﬂector conﬁguration is mounted on a ﬂexible substrate (poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET)). The resonance properties of a F-FBAR have been investigated through ﬁnite element
method (FEM) simulations. The effects of acoustic impedance layer thickness variation on the sensor efﬁciency have been
studied. This study gives new idea in designing of high-performance F-FBAR sensors. It is also reported that, for an
enhancement in coupling coefﬁcient bottom electrode must be placed just above the high acoustic impedance layer (W).
However, for enhancement in the quality factor bottom electrode must be placed just above the low acoustic impedance
layer (SiO2)."
128,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering 781,"Abstract New generation Radio Frequency Microelectromechanical Systems (RF
MEMS) Switches with high performance have been developed recently and the capa-
bility to exploit them for designing reconﬁgurable antennas is presented in this paper.
A parasitic antenna on a planar structure with the Yagi-Uda concept is used as a proof
of concept. The structure is composed of a dipole of half the wavelength of the oper-
ational frequency (the driven element) and a set of parallel parasitic elements on the
sides that are exploited to tune the antenna characteristics. Four antenna conﬁgura-
tions are obtained by adjusting the length of the parasitic elements using RF MEMS
switches placed at suitable discontinuities. The preliminary results demonstrated that
the considered antenna structure (operating in the X-band) is able to steer the beam
from broadside to end ﬁre pattern keeping a return loss below −10 dB and a good
gain in all the antenna conﬁgurations."
128,Optimization of a Flexible Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator-Based Toluene Gas Sensor,"Abstract
Flexible electronics have attracted wide attention for a variety of applications in the last few years; some based on compo-
nents such as diodes and transistors have been reported earlier. This paper reports an optimized design of a flexible film bulk 
acoustic resonator suitable as a sensor for toluene gas detection with polyethylene terephthalate as flexible substrate. Alu-
minium nitride, lead zirconate titanate, and zinc oxide were chosen as the piezoelectric materials, and a polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) coated electrode was placed on top to perform as a functional layer for sensing. Finite element modeling was used 
for the optimization of PDMS flexible film. The paper also reports the effect of different piezoelectric materials used, Bragg 
reflector stages and effect of PDMS layer thickness on the performance of the sensor. The optimal sensor configuration was 
obtained using Taguchi DoE and ANOVA techniques. For the optimized structure, simulated values of coupling coefficient, 
quality factor and figure of merit are 0.237574 (or 23.7574%), 991 and ~ 235, respectively. The sensor exposure to toluene 
in the concentrations from 0 to 500 ppm resulted in down shifting of its resonant frequency. Sensitivity of 12 kHz/ppm has 
been observed and reported."

validated through the finite element modeling (FEM) simulation. The optimization has been 
done to achieve enhancement in coupling coefficient of SMR sensor. The best optimized

In this work, a new circuit of delay cell is proposed to design a wide tuning range differential ring oscillator (DRO).

coated extended large area p-Si/n-ZnO heterojunction based
biosensing device to analyze the inﬂuence of functional
behavior of primary cortical neuronal cells. Wherein, the pro-
liferation of rat embryonic neurons and neural stem cells is
highly inﬂuenced by the physicochemicaland structural prop-
erties of the underlying substrate mimicking the extracellular
microenvironment. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in the
impedance values while adhesion of the neuronal cells on
the substrate; however, it further got signiﬁcantly decreased
with the progression of various cellular functions neurite
outgrowth and network formation. Such neuronal processes
might have increased the propagation of ﬂow of current by
reducing the resistivity of the PLL treated n-ZnO thin ﬁlm sensing area. Additionally, through the Nyquist plot, we observed
a noticeable decrease in the magnitude of impedance values of the fabricated device. Hence, we believe that the fabricated
PLL coated extended large area p-Si/n-ZnO heterojunction biosensor can serve as a favourable device to monitor the
inﬂuence of functional behavior of neuronal cells."

biosensing devices to analyze the inﬂuence of the func-
tional behaviour of primary cortical neuronal cells. Through
frequency-dependent impedance study, we observed an
increase in the impedance values initially most likely due
to cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation processes
leading to an increase in both the single-cell mass as
well as overall cellular mass; however, it got decreased
eventually with the progression of various other cellular
functions including neural activity, synapse formation and
neuron-neuron communication. Typically, formation and
regulation of the neuronal junction i.e., synapses notice-
ably affected the functional behaviour of the fabricated
biosensing device by increasing the neuronal commu-
nication and thereby improving the ﬂow of current by
altering the thin ﬁlm resistance and capacitance. Further,
the neuro-electrical phenomenon is validated by ﬁtting the
experimental impedance data to an equivalent electrical
circuit model. A signiﬁcant shift in the Nyquist plot was also
observed visually, which indicates that this alternation is
primarily due to change in characteristic behaviour of the
fabricated biosensing device. Hence, we anticipate that the
fabricated PLL coated large surface TiO2 and SnO2 based
biosensing device can serve as a promising tool to monitor
the inﬂuence of the functional behaviour of neuronal cells.

129,A portable standalone wireless electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system for assessing dynamic behavior of mammalian cells,"Abstract
In this study, we have developed a wireless, portable, standalone, and simple electric cell-substrate impedance
sensing (ECIS) system to analyze in-depth functional aspects of cellular functions on the surface of a co-planar
metal electrode coated on conventional glass substrate using a low-cost circuitry and correlated it with an
equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) model. Low-cost circuitry was used for studying the dynamic behavior of the
mouse myoblast cells (C2C12) in a culture chamber. Further, the developed ECIS system was connected with 8-bit
Arduino UNO microcontroller board for establishing a compact sized measuring unit, which can be placed inside a
CO2 incubator to provide proper environmental condition for the biological cells during the entire measuring time.
Integrating ZigBee RF module with the 8-bit Arduino UNO microcontroller board provides a wireless
communication network. Theoretical calculation of the lumped-elemental electrical parameters associated with cell-
electrolyte interface and metal-electrolyte interface was calculated. The calculation was performed by fitting the
experimental impedance data to EEC model using least mean square method to determine the dynamic and vital
functions of the mammalian cells such as proliferation (in real-time) with a change in intrinsic electrical parameters
associated at any particular time point. Impedance measurements and the lumped-elemental electrical parameter
were correlated with the respective microscopic images. The developed ECIS system was found to enable
measuring of the extent of cellular proliferation over time. The compactness of the developed ECIS system
integrated with the ZigBee RF module and the 8-bit Arduino UNO microcontroller board facilitates its utilization
even when placed in the CO2 incubator for a prolonged time."

ITO coated glass substrates. The CdSe QDs layer acts as the active
layer while the ZnO QDs layer act as the electron transport layer
(ETL) as well as a ﬁlter layer. The optical illumination is coupled
into the device through the substrate side to enhance the optical
absorption in the active layer due to multiple reﬂections from both
metal (Pd, Au)/ CdSe QDs and CdSe QDs/ZnO QDs interfaces.
The measured photoresponse over the 350–650 nm gives ∼61 nm

full width at half maximum (FWHM), EQE, and response time of
Pd (Au)/CdSe QDs based Schottky photodiodes, respectively. The
improvements in the spectrum selectivity, EQE, and response time
due to the change in the Schottky electrode from Au to Pd are
attributed to higher reﬂection characteristic of the Pd/CdSe QDs
interface than that of the Au/CdSe QDs interface which are duly
justiﬁed by measured results and theoretical models presented in
this paper. An improved responsivity with reduced FWHM ob-
tained by merely replacing the Au by Pd is possibly reported for
the ﬁrst time for the spectrum selective photodetectors.

Al2O3 using spin coating technique. At the top of solution 
processed ZnO thin film MoO2 (25 nm) is deposited. Aluminum 
is used as a top (50 nm) and bottom (80 nm) electrode deposited 
using thermal evaporation. The fabricated device forms a 
junction between MoO2 and ZnO which is characterized under 
the monochromatic UV light (650 µW at 365 nm). Th achieved 
responsivity of the device is 2.33 A/W. Further, the thin film of 
the ZnO is analyzed for optical characteristics and the obtained 
band gap is 3.31 eV."
130,Affection-Centric Metaverse in 6G: Initiative Learning Based In-Network Human-Like Sentimental Analysis,"Abstract
The forthcoming Metaverse will have to be 
based on future 6G networks, as 5G/5G-Advanced 
networks cannot cope with the assumed require­
ments, especially regarding latency, robustness 
of connections, and wireless access throughput. 
Another important aspect missing in current net­
works is the understanding of the role of human 
affections in interactions between humans and inter­
faces accessing the Metaverse. Such affections are 
hidden in large amounts of human-centric content, 
semantics, and sentiment-related data. Moreover, 
existing methods and schemes lack the capability 
of intelligently analyzing human sentiments. There 
is therefore the need to research sentimental anal­
ysis to thoroughly comprehend human demands in 
6G-driven Metaverse scenarios. With that enhance­
ment, 6G will be able to fulfill the expectation of 
providing a revolution in interactions between 
humans and virtual realities. To properly address 
that needed enhancement, this article proposes an 
initiative learning-based, affection-centric networking 
(ACN) for the 6G-enabled Metaverse, which utilizes 
artificial intelligence to enable human-like affection 
analysis at the network layer. First, an affection-cen­
tric, in-networking sentimental analysis framework 
is proposed, where the ACN architecture and the 
heterogeneous affection transformation mechanism 
are designed. Second, an initiative learning-based, 
in-network human-like sentimental analysis mech­
anism is developed. This mechanism maps data of 
devices and humans into hierarchical forms, ana­
lyzes emotions of humans in the network layer, and 
makes affection-centric decisions and predictions. 
Third, Metaverse standardization activities are stud­
ied. Finally, The case study and simulation results 
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed ACN 
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this work 
is the first to propose a novel ACN architecture."
130,A Software Platform for Testing Multi-Link Operation in Industrial Wi-Fi Networks,"Abstract—Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi 7 is expected
to tangibly boost throughput while lowering transmission latency
at the same time. This is very relevant in industrial scenarios and
makes MLO suitable, e.g., to support seamless device mobility.
Benefits depend on the ability of multi-link devices to select at
run-time the best link, among the available ones, in order to
maximize both communication performance and reliability.
In this paper an experimental platform is proposed, with the
aim of leveraging commercial hardware and open source soft-
ware, and easing prototyping and evaluation of MLO techniques.
The platform has been employed to analyze the transmission
quality of two pairs of non-overlapping channels, and in par-
ticular to assess whether or not adequate diversity is provided,
so that those channels can be exploited to improve reliability.
Results point out that correlation between different links is, in
most cases, limited, which makes MLO a valuable approach.

130,Wireless Network Digital Twin Calibrated by Real Time Telemetry and XR Feedback Interface,"Abstract—Managing Wireless networks, particularly in indus-
trial and factory environments, to meet the escalating demands
of time critical applications has become more complex and
warrants proactive management strategies. This work introduces
an innovative approach to wireless network management enabled
by a Digital Twin (DT) designed and continuously enhanced
by real-time device telemetry and user inputs through an Ex-
tended Reality interface. By collecting real telemetry data from
network devices, our methodology defines and calibrates a DT
representation of the network, enabling accurate prediction of
wireless signal properties and network performance based on
simulation models. The DT serves as an automation tool to
analyze various scenarios, allowing for informed adjustments to
user applications, devices and network configurations. The paper
describes a real-life DT implementation of a wireless system
in a real enterprise network scenario. Experimental results are
provided demonstrating improved performance and user experi-
ence enabled by the proposed DT-based network management.
The proposed methodology addresses the challenges of real-
time network optimization and contributes to advance wireless
network management based on device and network telemetry."
130,Multi-Link Operation and Wireless Digital Twin to Support Enhanced Roaming in Next-Gen Wi-Fi,"Abstract—The next generation of Wi-Fi is meant to achieve
ultra-high reliability for wireless communication. Several ap-
proaches are available to this extent, some of which are being
considered for inclusion in standards specifications, including
coordination of access points to reduce interference.
In this paper, we propose a centralized architecture based on
digital twins, called WiTwin, with the aim of supporting wireless
stations in selecting the optimal association according to a set of
parameters. Unlike prior works, we assume that Wi-Fi 7 features
like multi-link operation (MLO) are available. Moreover, one of
the main goals of this architecture is to preserve communication
quality in the presence of mobility, by helping stations to perform
reassociation at the right time and in the best way.

130,Ilias Maglogiannis,"abstract explores the diverse
applications of AI in advancing the goals of the Green Deal, encompassing areas such
as energy efﬁciency, smart infrastructure, waste management, and biodiversity con-
servation. AI technologies, including machine learning, data analytics, and optimiza-
tion algorithms, play a crucial role in enhancing energy systems’ efﬁciency and
promoting the integration of renewable energy sources and harvesting marine energy,
thus aligning with the Green Deal’s commitment to sustainable energy practices.

The 9th Workshop on “5G – Putting
Intelligence to the Network Edge”
(5G-PINE)
Preface to 5G-PINE 2024 Proceedings
The ninth 5G-PINE Workshop, following the great success, the wider market- and
research-oriented impact and the good tradition of its predecessors, was established and
organized in a concrete and efﬁcient way to disseminate knowledge obtained from
actual 5G EU-funded projects (mainly coming from the 5G-PPP/Horizon 2020
framework and the Horizon-JU-SNS framework, both covering 5G and “Beyond 5G”
(B5G) aspects) as well as from other research actions in the wider thematic area of “5G
Innovative Activities – Putting Intelligence to the Network Edge (“5G-PINE”)” and
with the aim of focusing upon Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) applications in modern 5G-
oriented telecommunications infrastructures.
Based on its selected research papers that have promoted a highly competitive
framework of reference in the modern 5G/B5G environment, the 9th 5G-PINE
Workshop again had a strong and deep impact on the broader context of the AIAI 2024
International Conference, which has been hosted by the Ionian University in Corfu,
Greece (June 27–30, 2024). For once again, the preparatory work was mainly driven by
the hard organizational effort, the dynamic coordination and the continuous supervision
of Dr. Ioannis P. Chochliouros (Head of Fixed Network R&D Programs Section,
Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. - OTE, Greece) who has been the
main organizer of the event for 9 subsequent years.
Support has also been provided by: Dr. Latif Ladid (President of IPv6 Forum and
Researcher of SnT/University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Mr. Daniele Porcu
(ENEL Global Infrastructure and Networks S.r.l., Italy) also coordinator of the 5G-
PPP/Horizon 2020 project “Smart5Grid”; Prof. Pavlos Lazaridis (University of Hud-
dersﬁeld, UK); Dr. Zaharias Zaharis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece); Dr.
Slawomir Kukliński and Dr. Lechosław Tomaszewski (Orange Polska, Poland); Prof.
Nancy Alonistioti (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece); Dr.
Christos-Antonios Gizelis (Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. - OTE,
Greece), and; Michail-Alexandros Kourtis (National Centre for Scientiﬁc Research
“DEMOKRITOS”, Greece).
Special thanks also to Mrs. Anastasia S. Spiliopoulou (Hellenic Telecommunica-
tions Organization S.A. - OTE), Lawyer and IT expert, for her valuable support in a
multiplicity of issues covering administration, technology and direct market impact
and/or applicability.
Apart from the above members of the Workshop Organizing Committee, the entire
process was also supported by more than 80 European experts, several of whom came
from the relevant EU-funded projects (such as H2020/5G-PPP, Horizon-JU-SNS,
Horizon and Digital Europe) “6G-PATH”, “Smart5Grid”, “NANCY”, “AMBITIOUS”,
“DATAMITE,
“ETHER”,
“6G-SENSES”,
“OCTAPUS”
and
“EMPOWER”/
“TRACY”. These projects formed the “core” of the corresponding effort towards
realizing a “joint” 5G-PINE 2024 Workshop, purely “5G/B5G”-oriented.
Among the originally submitted 29 papers, 13 have ﬁnally been accepted as full
papers (acceptance ratio of 45%) due the high quality of the works and, most impor-
tantly, due to their strong relevance to ongoing EU-funded research activities, while at
the same time 1 short paper was accepted due to its signiﬁcant academic strength. The
accepted papers promote important innovation aspects from current – and in most of
cases already validated and tested – 5G research activities, thus “delineating” incen-
tives for growth in the market sector.
The 9th 5G-PINE Workshop promoted, inter-alia, the context of modern 5G net-
work infrastructures and of related innovative services in a complex and highly
heterogeneous underlying wireless communications ecosystem, strongly enhanced by
the inclusion of cognitive capabilities and intelligence features, with the aim of sig-
niﬁcantly improving network management and orchestration. Furthermore, based upon
the well-known Self-Organizing Network (SON) functionalities, the 9th 5G-PINE
Workshop not only identiﬁed but also promoted network planning and optimization
processes through Artiﬁcial Intelligence- (AI-) based tools, able to smartly process
input data from the surrounding environment(s) and come up with extended knowledge
that can be formalized in terms of models and/or structured metrics, to explicitly
“depict” the network behavior to a satisfactory level. This allows, among others, in-
depth and detailed knowledge to be gained about the whole underlying 5G ecosystem;
also understanding of hidden “patterns”, data structures and relationships in a diversity
of (interactive) sectors and, ultimately; their use for more efﬁcient network manage-
ment to respond to a multiplicity of situations and requirements to provide new market
offerings and/or solutions.
In parallel, related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were also discussed, eval-
uated and assessed to the extent possible, to demonstrate progress implicated by the
ongoing – or even by the expected – 5G/B5G growth. Among the “core objectives” of
the 5G-PINE 2024 Workshop was to support “delivery and implementation of intel-
ligence” directly to the network’s edge, by exploiting the emerging paradigms of
Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN), Net-
work Slicing (NS) and Edge Cloud Computing. Moreover, the Workshop also sup-
ported promotion of rich virtualization and multi-tenant capabilities, optimally
deployed close to the end-user(s) and, consequently, enhancing network and service
opportunities towards establishing a competitive and innovative telecoms market with
ﬂavours to multiple verticals.
Among the pillars of the 9th 5G-PINE Workshop was the innovative background of
the ongoing Horizon-JU-SNS “6G-PATH”project, whose goal is to help foster the
further development and integration of new and improved tools and products from EU
companies with 5G/6G, while also measuring relevant KPIs and KVIs. To achieve this,
seven (7) dedicated testbeds will be part of the project consortium, which will be used
by ten (10) use cases spread across four (4) key verticals of the market, that is: Health,
Education, Smart Cities and Farming. Moreover, in the detailed context for Financial
Support to Third Parties (FSTP), the project envisions the integration of two (2) new
pilot sites, extension of the testbeds with ten (10) additional technologies as well as
thirty (30) new Use Cases, through Open Calls, to further involve the community and
obtain more metrics and outcomes. 6G-PATH plans to work closely with other
ongoing/starting SNS JU Stream-B and Stream-C projects in a “feedback” loop, to
promote innovation.
Another essential “core” of the 9th 5G-PINE Workshop has been the framework
promoted by the 5G-PPP/H2020 “Smart5Grid”project, revolutionizing the energy

vertical industry through the successful establishment of four fundamental functions of
modern smart grids. Speciﬁc emphasis has been put on aspects coming from a very
interesting use case with strong market impact, dealing with real-time wide-area
monitoring of power interconnected systems between Greece and Bulgaria. Further-
more, Smart5Grid introduces an open 5G experimental facility, supporting integration,
testing and validation of existing and new 5G services and NetApps from third parties,
also supplying start-ups and newcomers with the opportunity to accelerate their growth
in the high impact industry of the energy vertical.
The context of the 9th 5G-PINE Workshop has also been enriched by contributions
originating from the ongoing Horizon-JU-SNS “NANCY” project. The overall aim of
this effort is to introduce a secure and intelligent architecture for the beyond the ﬁfth
generation (B5G) wireless network. Leveraging AI and blockchain, NANCY enables
secure and intelligent resource management, ﬂexible networking and orchestration. In
this direction, novel architectures, namely point-to-point (P2P) connectivity for device-
to-device connectivity, mesh networking and relay-based communications, as well as
protocols for medium access, mobility management and resource allocation are to be
designed. These architectures and protocols will make the most by jointly optimizing
the midhaul and fronthaul.
Another pillar of the Workshop has been the dynamic framework promoted by the
I3-PJG “AMBITIOUS” project, intending to offer a fundamental technological
infrastructure, which will provide advanced data aggregation and clean-up, analytics,
AI-enabled forecasting and secure information exchange mechanisms, via a transparent
computing continuum infrastructure, to be integrated with existing, mature services (of
at least TRL6) of the relevant stakeholders (i.e., mainly SMEs), unleashing for them yet
unforeseen functionalities and opening up new pathways of commercial exploitation.
The envisaged fundamental infrastructure will be provided via the deployment of
technological initiatives, which will interact with existing services towards supporting
the envisioned functionalities.
Strong feedback has also been provided by the framework of the Horizon
“DATAMITE” project, that foresees to revolutionize the European Data Market by
helping users (such SMEs, large enterprises and public administrations) to better
monetize, govern and enhance the trust of their data, e"

Things (mIoT), how to effectively manage spectrum resources
to support huge data traffic under the large-scale overlap-

the imperative challenge. In this paper, a novel hypergraph
interference model is designed, and two reinforcement learning

graphical animations of actual and future scenarios is essential. 
Decentralised Networks and Web 4.0: The transition from a centralised Internet architecture to 
a decentralised Web 4.0 framework is foundational to the next-generation IoT. Web 4.0 utilises 
blockchain technology to create a more secure, transparent, and user-controlled online 
environment. In the context of IoT, this means devices can communicate and transact in a peer-
to-peer manner without centralised intermediaries. This decentralisation enhances security, 
reduces the risk of single points of failure, and enables new forms of device interoperability and 
data sharing. 
Intelligent and Autonomous ""Things"": Next-generation IoT devices are not just hyperconnected 
but more intelligent and equipped with AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities. These 
devices can process data, make decisions, and act autonomously. Edge computing plays a 
crucial role here, allowing data processing to occur closer to where data is generated, thereby 
reducing latency, conserving bandwidth, and enhancing privacy. The devices are equipped 
with self-X capabilities (e.g., self-configuration, self-awareness, and self-diagnosis) that enable 
them to adapt to various environments, optimise their performance, and anticipate 
maintenance needs without human intervention. 
Immersive Technologies and Spatial Computing: Immersive technologies, including AR, VR, and 
MR, known collectively as XR, combined with spatial computing, bring a new dimension to IoT. 
These technologies allow users to interact with digital information and IoT devices more naturally 
and intuitively. For instance, engineers could use AR/MR glasses to see a holographic overlay of 
the internal component of a machine, sourced from real-time IoT sensor data, facilitating 
quicker diagnostics and cheaper repairs. 
Holographic Representations: Holographic technology is set to revolutionise how we visualise 
and interact with data. In an IoT context, holographic representations can provide detailed, 
three-dimensional visualisations of data and systems.

This can be particularly useful for complex industrial processes, urban planning, and healthcare 
diagnostics, offering a level of detail and interactivity that traditional screens cannot match, 
however, paying in terms of quality of the user’s field of view. 
Multi-Protocol Intelligent Connectivity: The need for advanced connectivity solutions grows as 
IoT devices become more sophisticated. Next-generation IoT technologies will likely employ 
intelligent connectivity systems that can dynamically choose the best communication protocol 
(e.g., Wi-Fi, 5G/6G, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN) based on the specific requirements of each task, such 
as quality of service (QoS), price, bandwidth, latency, range, and power consumption. This 
flexibility ensures that devices communicate efficiently and reliably in various environments, 
scenarios and use cases.  
The next-generation IoT represents a convergence of several cutting-edge technologies, each 
contributing to a more intelligent, interactive, and interconnected world. By combining the 
decentralised principles of Web 4.0 with the intelligence and autonomy of advanced IoT 
devices and enhancing user interaction through immersive and holographic technologies, this 
new era of IoT is set to offer unprecedented opportunities for innovation and transformation 
across all aspects of society. As these technologies evolve and mature, the potential 
applications and impacts of next-generation IoT will only expand, promising a future where 
digital and physical realms are more closely integrated and industrial immersive technologies 
create distinct experiences by merging the physical world with the digital and virtual realities as 
illustrated in Figure 2-4. 
 
 Figure 2-4 Edge IoT industrial immersive technologies. 
The future vision of industrial immersive systems (VR, AR, MR verses - metaverse, omniverse, 
multiverse) converging with IoT, edge computing, AI, spatial computing, and Web 4.0 represents 
a transformative leap towards creating interconnected, intelligent, and highly immersive 
industrial environments and brings new important feature developments as presented below.  
Seamless Integration of the Physical, Digital, Virtual and Cyber Worlds: In this vision, industrial 
environments are augmented with spatial computing and immersive technologies, allowing for 
a seamless fusion of tangible, digital, virtual, and cyber realms. Workers equipped with AR 
glasses or VR headsets can visualise IoT sensor data overlaid directly onto machinery, see real-
time AI-driven analytics, and interact with 3D models of complex systems. This integration 
enhances understanding, speeds up decision-making, and facilitates remote collaboration with 
experts worldwide, breaking geographical, location and spatial barriers to build “virtual worlds” 
technologies and applications.

Autonomous and Self-Optimising Factories: By leveraging IoT, edge computing, and AI, factories 
become fully autonomous and capable of self-optimisation in real-time. Machines with sensors 
continuously feed data to edge computing devices that analyse this information locally, 
minimising latency. AI algorithms predict maintenance needs, optimise production schedules 
based on real-time demand, and automatically adjust processes to reduce waste and energy 
consumption. This creates a highly efficient, sustainable manufacturing environment that can 
quickly adjust to evolving market conditions. 
Personalised and Adaptive Workspaces: Every worker's experience is personalised in these future 
industrial settings. AI understands individual preferences, skill levels, and work styles, adjusting the 
information displayed through immersive interfaces accordingly. This personalisation extends to 
learning and training, where immersive simulations adapt in real-time to the learner's progress, 
offering a tailored educational experience that maximises skill acquisition and retention. 
Decentralised Manufacturing Ecosystems: With the integration of Web 4.0 technologies, 
manufacturing ecosystems become decentralised and more democratic. Blockchain enables 
secure, transparent supply chain operations, smart contracts automate transactions, and 
decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions offer new financing models for manufacturers. This shift 
increases efficiency and transparency and opens the manufacturing ecosystem to smaller 
players, fostering innovation and collaboration. 
Immersive Triplets, Avatars and Spatial Computing: Immersive triplets, spatial virtual replicas of 
physical systems, become fully immersive, allowing engineers to interact with and analyse 
complex systems in a 3D space. Spatial computing enables these immersive triplets to be 
spatially mapped to their physical counterparts, offering an intuitive and comprehensive 
understanding of how digital, virtual, and cyber changes affect the physical world. This 
capability is crucial for testing new ideas, predicting system behaviours under various conditions, 
and training AI models with virtual data, reducing the need for costly physical prototypes. 
Enhanced Human-Machine Interaction: The convergence of these technologies revolutionises 
human-machine interaction. A set of AI-related technologies, like natural language processing 
(NLP), ML, deep learning (DL), and generative AI enable intuitive and context-aware voice and 
gesture controls. Workers communicate with machines as easily as they would with human 
colleagues, issuing commands, receiving feedback, and even collaborating on tasks. Avatars 
can support advanced and natural conversation with immersive technology users, protecting 
the feeling of immersion. This enhances safety, efficiency, and the overall user experience in 
industrial environments. 
Enhanced Human Expression: The availability of systems that provide rich feedback to humans 
across multiple sensory modalities, including immersive triplets, enables users to express precise 
actions relating to objects. Such actions can indicate relative positions, orientations, and 
applied force related to digital constructs or virtual replicas of real-life objects. This considerably 
enhances the efficiency and precision with which humans can express themselves intuitively. 
This capability creates a new way for people to work. 
Global, Real-Time Collaboration Platforms: Immersive systems and Web 4.0 technologies 
facilitate the creation of global, real-time collaboration platforms. Teams globally can work 
together in a shared virtual space as if they were in the same room, accessing shared 
blockchain assets and leveraging collective intelligence to solve complex problems. This 
accelerates innovation and fosters a more inclusive and diverse industrial ecosystem. 
The vision for the future of industrial immersive systems, intertwined with IoT, edge computing, AI, 
spatial computing, and Web 4.0, coats a picture of highly efficient, sustainable, and 
democratised industrial environments.

This future is characterised by intuitive human-machine interfaces, personalised experiences, 
and a seamless blend of physical and digital worlds, offering vast potential for innovation, 
collaboration, and growth across all industry sectors. While challenges remain in realising this 
vision, the potential benefits make it a compelling direction for the future of various industrial 
domains. 
Edge IoT industrial immersive technologies play crucial roles in facilitating a sustainable twin 
digital and green transition. This synergy not only accelerates digital transformation but also 
enhances the sustainability of processes, environments, and ecosystems. 
The convergence of edge IoT, AI, generative heuristics, Web 4.0, DT, IT, IoTS, AR, VR, MR, XR, 
verse technologies (metaverse, omniverse, multiverse) and system design integrated approach 
drives efficiency and sustainability. It ensures that digital technology advancements directly 
contribute to greener outcomes, aligning technological progress with environmental 
stewardship. The twin digital and green transition is, thus, seen not merely as a parallel 
development of digital and sustainable practices but as their convergence towards a holistic 
goal.

3. Definitions and Taxonomy 
IoT and edge computing research and innovation address IoT/edge continuum distributed 
architectures, intelligent connectivity. End-to-end (E2E) security, heterogenous IoT edge mesh, 
IoT DTs, AI, IoT swarm systems, IoTS, trustworthiness, verification, validation, and testing (VV&T), 
standardisation, and the convergence of all the above into the Internet of Intelligent Things. 
Immersive technology refers to any technology that blurs the line between the physical and 
digital worlds, creating a sense of presence and engagement for the user. Immersive 
technologies aim to transport users to virtual environments or enhance their real-world 
experiences by overlaying digital information onto their physical surroundings through real-time 
interactions in physical, digital, virtual, cyber, and spatial environments. 
Immersive technologies have emerged as a revolutionary approach to creating digital 
experiences that feel real to users.  
By incorporating various tools and systems, immersive technology encompasses real-time 
interactions in physical, digital, virtual, cyber, and spatial environments using a broad spectrum 
of experiences that blur the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds, providing 
innovative ways to interact, explore, and learn. 
IoT and edge computing enable innovation and broad adoption in immersive technologies and 
applications by bringing the novel elements of converging technologies to the edge and real-
time interaction between the physical and virtual worlds. An overview of edge immersive 
technologies is illustrated in Figure 3-"
130,INTEND: Intent-Based Data Operation in the Computing Continuum,"Abstract
The European Commission (EC) Digital Decade strategy to gain by 2030 autonomy in the digital economy
requires more and more data to be processed in the Cloud-Edge-IoT computing continuum, instead of
only in the central cloud. This requires advanced automation and intelligence of the continuum. At
the same time, recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research have shown unprecedented
results in handling creative tasks. Such human-like intelligence will eventually disrupt how people use
the cloud and continuum. The European Union (EU) -funded project INTEND aims at bringing such
human-like intelligence into the cognitive continuum, to achieve the novel concept of intent-based data
operation. The project will deliver 11 novel software tools, which integrate into an INTEND toolbox.
The outputs pave the way of migrating EU’s data industry from cloud to the continuum, and implement
EC’s strategy of human-centric AI in the domain of data processing and computing continuum.

130,mdpi.com/journal/sensors,"Abstract:
The high heterogeneity of 5G use cases requires the extension of the traditional
per-component testing procedures provided by certiﬁcation organizations, in order to devise and
incorporate methodologies that cover the testing requirements from vertical applications and services.
In this paper, we introduce an experimentation methodology that is deﬁned in the context of the
5GENESIS project, which aims at enabling both the testing of network components and validation of
E2E KPIs. The most important contributions of this methodology are its modularity and ﬂexibility,
as well as the open-source software that was developed for its application, which enable lightweight
adoption of the methodology in any 5G testbed. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be
used, by executing and analyzing different experiments in a 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) deployment at
the University of Malaga. The key ﬁndings of the paper are an initial 5G performance assessment and
KPI analysis and the detection of under-performance issues at the application level. Those ﬁndings
highlight the need for reliable testing and validation procedures towards a fair benchmarking of
generic 5G services and applications."
130,Information Timeliness Guaranteed Communication and Energy Control Integration in Multi-Mode Power IoT,"Abstract—The concurrent availability of power-line communi-
cation, cellular and other wireless technologies, and the rapid
development of concepts like multi-mode power internet of
things (PIoT) and digital twin (DT) have made intelligent en-
ergy control a reality. However, information timeliness guarantee
which determines DT consistency and energy control degradation
is still an unsolved issue, as recent studies mainly focus on
time-averaged guarantee and ignore the occurrence of extreme
events. In this paper, we propose a novel metric named ultra-
low age of information (ULAoI), which imposes more stringent
constraints on extreme event occurrence probability and high-
order statistics characteristics of excess AoI value. Moreover, we
minimize energy control performance degradation by optimizing
communication control, which acts as the bridge connecting
information collection and utilization. A joint device scheduling
and multi-mode channel allocation algorithm based on ULAoI-
prioritized learning is proposed to achieve communication and
control integration. Simulation results verify that the proposed
algorithm can signiﬁcantly reduce energy control performance
degradation and achieve ULAoI guarantee.

130,An Evolutionary Edge Computing Architecture for the Beyond 5G Era,"Abstract— Beyond 5G (B5G) communication networks 
face the challenge of meeting the demanding requirements of 
various service types, including uRLLC, mIoT, eMBB, and 
emerging technologies like Extended Reality (XR). Edge 
computing can address these demands effectively because of 
the ability to bring computational power and resources closer 
to the source of data. Nevertheless, the realization of this 
potential necessitates an open, flexible, and automated 
architectural framework capable of supporting disaggregated 
applications and network designs. In this context, this paper 
introduces a novel architecture designed to advance the 
evolution of edge computing in B5G, developed within the EU-
funded project VERGE. The proposed architecture is 
modular and scalable, guided by artificial intelligence (AI), 
and founded on three essential pillars: ""edge for AI,"" ""AI for 
edge,"" and ""security, privacy, and trustworthiness for AI."" 
After presenting this architecture, the paper showcases its 
applicability through the examination of two vertical use cases 
within the industrial and transportation domains."
130,Microsoft Word - 6G_PDN_A hierarchical_AI-based_control_plane_solution_for_multi-technology_deterministic_networks_CR,"ABSTRACT  
Following the Industry 4.0 vision of a full digitization of the 
industry, time-critical services and applications, allowing network 
infrastructures to deliver information with determinism and 
reliability, are becoming more and more relevant for a set of 
vertical sectors. As a consequence, deterministic network solutions 
are progressively emerging, albeit they are still bounded to specific 
technological domains. Even considering the existence of 
interconnected deterministic networks, the provision of an end-to-
end (E2E) deterministic service over them must rely on a specific 
control plane architecture, capable of seamlessly integrate and 
control the underlying multi-technology data plane. In this work, 
we envision such a control plane solution, extending previous 
works and exploiting several innovations and novel architectural 
concepts. The proposed control architecture is service-centric, in 
order to provide the necessary flexibility, scalability, and 
modularity to deal with a heterogenous data plane. The architecture 
is hierarchical and encompasses a set of management platforms to 
interact with specific network technologies overarched by an E2E 
platform for the management, monitoring, and control of E2E 
deterministic services. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
Digital Twinning are used to enable network predictability and 
automation, as well as smart resource allocation, to ensure service 
reliability in dynamic scenarios where existing services may 
terminate and new ones may need to be deployed.

This paper provides an extensive analysis of Reliable and 
Available Wireless (RAW) enhancements and solutions needed to 
manage industrial environments more effectively. Starting from 
the description of a representative industrial use case, an analysis 
of gaps and promising new extensions is performed. Namely, the 
need to (i) support multi-domain operation, at both technology 
and administrative levels; (ii) integrate RAW with edge 
architectures; and, (iii) increase the mobility support in RAW 
networks. The identified gaps are indeed not yet tackled by the 
relevant standardization development organizations, mainly the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and are thus object of 
our future work.

SDOs

AI-Enabled 
DeterminIstiC neTworking for 6G (PREDICT-6G1) addresses the 
above issues by: i) developing an E2E solution for deterministic 
(predictable, reliable and time sensitive) heterogeneous wireless 
networks; ii) impacting with its results several SDO, e.g, 3GPP, 
IETF, and IEEE 802.11; iii) using Reliable and Available 
Wireless 2  (RAW) as one of the key elements of the novel 
proposed control plane. 
RAW is an effort to provide deterministic networking on a 
path that includes a wireless interface, with the scope of 
delivering higher reliability and availability of IP connectivity. 
The 
wireless 
medium 
presents 
challenges 
in 
achieving 
deterministic properties such as low packet error rate, limited 
consecutive losses, and limited latency. RAW, based on the 
concepts of the Deterministic Networking (DetNet 3 ) Working 
Group (WG), addresses the above mentioned challenges in an IP 
network using scheduled wireless segments and other media. Like 
DetNet, RAW technologies abstract the radio layers underneath, 
addressing the Layer 3 (L3) aspects in support of applications 
requiring high reliability and availability. 
    The RAW concept, discussed in [2], separates the path 
computation time scale, where complex paths are computed, from 
the path selection time scale (significantly lower than the path 
computation time), where the forwarding decision is taken for one 
or a few packets. The RAW approach operates at the path 
selection time scale to provide more reliable and available 
wireless IP connectivity. The decision of which redundant 
forwarding path for each packet to select, previously calculated by 
the Path Computation Element (PCE), is instead made by the Path 
Selection Engine (PSE). The PSE uses rapid local adjustments of 
forwarding tables within the diverse options defined by the PCE. 
This enables the use of Packet (hybrid) Automatic Repeat reQuest 
(ARQ), Replication, Elimination, and Ordering (PAREO), and 
scheduled transmissions with the purpose of improving the 
utilization of resources. 
In several use cases [4]-[6] reliability and availability are key 
requirements for wireless heterogeneous networks, for instance in 
the manufacturing sector."
130,AI-Powered Edge Computing Evolution for Beyond 5G Communication Networks,"Abstract— Edge computing is a key enabling technology that is 
expected to play a crucial role in beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G 
communication networks. By bringing computation closer to 
where the data is generated, and leveraging Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) capabilities for advanced automation and orchestration, edge 
computing can enable a wide range of emerging applications with 
extreme requirements in terms of latency and computation, across 
multiple vertical domains. In this context, this paper first discusses 
the key technological challenges for the seamless integration of 
edge computing within B5G/6G and then presents a roadmap for 
the edge computing evolution, proposing a novel design approach 
for an open, intelligent, trustworthy, and distributed edge 
architecture."
130,Communication-Control Co-design for Robotic Manipulation in 5G Industrial IoT,"Abstract—Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use cases have 
stringent reliability and latency requirements to enable real-time 
wireless control systems, which are supported by the 5G ultra-
reliable 
low-latency 
communications 
(URLLC). 
However, 
extremely high quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in 5G 
URLLC causes huge radio resource consumption and low spectral 
efficiency, thus limiting network capacity in terms of the number 
of supported devices. Industrial control applications typically 
incorporate redundancy in their design and may not always 
require extreme QoS to achieve the expected control performance. 
Therefore, we propose both communication-control co-design and 
dynamic QoS to address the capacity issue for robotic 
manipulation use cases in 5G-based IIoT. We have developed an 
advanced co-simulation framework that includes a network 
simulator, physics simulator, and compute emulator, for realistic 
performance evaluation of the proposed methods. Through 
simulations, we show significant improvements in network 
capacity (i.e., the number of supported URLLC devices), and 
about 2x gain for the robotic manipulation use case."
130,Ultra-Low AoI Digital Twin-Assisted Resource Allocation for Multi-Mode Power IoT in Distribution Grid Energy Management,"Abstract— Age of information (AoI) is an important metric
of information timeliness, which determines digital twin (DT)
consistency and energy management precision. However, AoI
guarantee in the time-averaged sense is unreliable to avoid the
occurrence of extreme event. In this paper, we propose a novel
information timeliness metric named ultra-low AoI (ULAoI).
Compared with AoI, ULAoI further considers the occurrence
of extreme event and higher-order statistical characteristics of
excess AoI value. Multi-dimensional resources of power internet
of things (PIoT) are jointly allocated to achieve ULAoI guarantee
from the perspective of sensing-communication-control integra-
tion. ULAoI-DT-Prioritized deep Q network (DQN) is proposed
to achieve coordinated resource allocation by approximating
unobservable information with the assistance of ULAoI-DT, and
preventing DQN training from using samples with large AoI
based on ULAoI-induced priority. Simulation results demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in global loss
function, ULAoI guarantee, and energy management optimality."
130,Asynchronous FDRL-Based Low-Latency Computation Offloading for Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Power IoT,"Abstract
Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial power 
internet of things (IPIoT) has emerged as a 
paradigm shift to three-dimensional vertical com-
munication networks for power systems in the 
6G era. Computation offloading plays key roles 
in enabling real-time data processing and analy-
sis for electric services. However, computation 
offloading in IPIoT still faces challenges of cou-
pling between task offloading and computation 
resource allocation, resource heterogeneity and 
dynamics, and degraded model training caused 
by electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this 
article, we propose an asynchronous federated 
deep reinforcement learning (AFDRL)-based com-
putation offloading framework for IPIoT, where 
models are uploaded asynchronously for feder-
ated averaging to relieve network congestion and 
improve global model training. Then, we propose 
an Asynchronous fedeRated deep reinforcemenT 
learnIng-baSed low-laTency computation off-
loading algorithm (ARTIST) to realize low-latency 
computation offloading through joint optimiza-
tion of task offloading and computation resource 
allocation. Particularly, ARTIST adopts EMI-aware 
federated set determination to remove aberrant 
local models from federated averaging and improve 
training accuracy. Next, a case study is developed 
to validate the excellent performance of ARTIST in 
reducing task offloading and total queuing delays."
130,Seamless Redundancy for High Reliability Wi-Fi,"Abstract—By removing wire harness, Wi-Fi is becoming in-
creasingly pervasive in every aspect of our lives, in both the
consumer and industrial worlds. Besides flexibility, the recent
high efficiency and extremely high throughput versions managed
to close the performance gap with Ethernet. However, it still lags
behind Ethernet for what concerns dependability. To this aim,
the ultra high reliability study group has been recently formed.
This paper reports on some preliminary ideas and proposals
about the ways seamless redundancy can be exploited to make
Wi-Fi more reliable, yet retaining a good degree of backward
compatibility with existing network infrastructures.

130,Zero-Delay Roaming for Mobile Robots Enabled by Wireless TSN Redundancy,"Abstract—Mobile and autonomous robots are among the most
critical technology applications requiring wireless connectivity
with deterministic performance, including bounded latency with
high reliability, even under congested network conditions. Emerg-
ing Wireless Time-Sensitive Networking (WTSN) capabilities over
Wi-Fi and 5G can enable time synchronization and bounded
low latency through time-aware scheduling mechanisms. Such
Wireless TSN capabilities have been demonstrated in several
industrial/robotic use cases, but under static conditions. Mobility
introduces new challenges due to the roaming events and associ-
ated network outages owing to signaling between client devices
and network infrastructure during these events. In this paper,
we show how we can take advantage of the TSN redundancy
capability (as deﬁned in the IEEE 802.1CB standard) to eliminate
outages or delays due to events like roaming and interference
in a mobile robot use case enabled by Wi-Fi 6 TSN. We
demonstrate the roaming performance with no delay impact on
the applications though simulations of a mobile robot in a factory
scenario and experimental results with a mobile robot connected
via multiple Wi-Fi 6 radios in a warehouse environment."

131,Exploring Graph Neural Network in Administrative Medical Dataset,"Abstract—Administrative medical dataset contains medical
records of patients. Using administrative medical dataset can
extract disease association to help ﬁnding comorbidity. Previous
methods only use statistics on administrative medical dataset
such as computing probabilities of disease occurrence and are
limited by the capability of statistics. To enhance hidden infor-
mation usage of administrative medical dataset, we propose two
different methods based on graph neural networks to exploit
hidden information in administrative medical dataset. One is
using graph neural networks to generate disease embeddings
and pass through kNN algorithm to ﬁnd similar diseases for
suggestion to physicians. The other one is that we formulate
sequence prediction problem and use gated graph neural network
to model every disease sequence by forming session graphs.
Different from previous methods for sequence prediction that
only consider current sequence, we also consider all sequences
in dataset at the same time. Besides, we use position-aware soft-
attention mechanism to aggregate disease embeddings to session
embeddings and predict the next disease of a patient. We conduct
extensive experiments on two methods and show its ability to
outperform several baselines."
131,A Data-Driven Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Docked Bike Prediction,"Abstract—Docked bike systems have been widely deployed in
many cities around the world. To the service provider, predicting
the demand and supply of bikes at any station is crucial to
offering the best service quality. The docked bike prediction
problem is highly challenging because of the complicated joint
spatial-temporal (ST) dependency as bikes are picked up and
dropped off, the so-called “ﬂows”, between stations. Prior works
often considered the spatial and temporal dependencies sepa-
rately using sequential network models, and based on locality
assumptions. Without sufﬁciently capturing the joint spatial and
temporal features, these approaches are not optimal for attaining
the best prediction accuracy.
We
propose
STGNN-DJD,
a
novel
data-driven
Spatial-
Temporal Graph Neural Network to solve the bike demand
and supply prediction problem by uniﬁedly embedding the
Dynamic and Joint ST Dependency in two novel ST graphs.
Given station locations and historical rental data on bike ﬂow
over the past time slots 0 to t −1, we seek to predict online
the bike demand and supply at any station at time t. To extract
joint spatial-temporal dependency, STGNN-DJD employs a graph
generator to construct, at the beginning of time t, two graphs
that embed the ﬂow relationships between stations at various
time slots (ﬂow-convoluted graph) and dynamic demand-supply
pattern correlation between stations (pattern correlation graph),
respectively. Given the two spatial-temporal graphs, STGNN-DJD
subsequently employs a graph neural network with novel ﬂow-
based and attention-based aggregators to generate embedding
of each station for docked bike prediction. We have conducted
extensive experiments on two large bike-sharing datasets. Our re-
sults conﬁrm the effectiveness of STGNN-DJD as compared with
other state-of-the-art approaches, with signiﬁcant improvement
on RMSE and MAE (by 20%−50%). We also provide a case study
on dynamic dependencies between stations and demonstrate that
the locality assumption does not always hold for a docked bike
system."
131,Deep Ensemble Learning Model for Long-Term Travel Time Prediction on Highways,"Abstract—Travel time plays a vital role in people’s daily lives.
It can help them not merely avoid traffic congestion but save
time as well. Additionally, on account of the interactive influence
of time, we divide data into long and short sequences and exploit
data to predict next-hour travel time. We introduce a deep
ensemble learning model which predicts the traveling time by
taking tendency, deriving by XGBoostm and recency embeddings,
deriving by a deep neural network, into account. The experiments
on the real dataset shows that the proposed model outperforms
other state-of-the-art models."
131,A Hybrid Deep Learning Network for Long-Term Travel Time Prediction in Freeways,"Abstract—Travel time plays a vital role in people’s daily lives.
It can help them not merely avoid trafﬁc congestion but save
time as well. When people need to drive to different cities by
taking highways, travel time become more and more important
now that they can check it to arrange better routes. Moreover,
because COVID-19 are epidemic across Taiwan, people prefer
to drive rather than taking public transportation. Therefore,
accurate predictions of travel time is of great signiﬁcance. In
order to obtain precise predictions and correspond to situations
in real life, we divide data into long and short sequences and
create three types of dataset, including the whole year, only
national holidays, and non-holidays. Additionally, on account
of the interactive inﬂuence of time in different segments of the
freeway, we exploit data to predict next-hour travel time instead
of next 5 minutes. We introduce a deep learning model which
hybrids tendency from XGBoost and recency embeddings from
a fully-connected neural network, respectively. It can capture
crucial features of both long and short sequences and observe
implicit correlations between XGBoost and a fully-connected
neural network. Extensive experiments on the dataset illustrate
that our model achieves eminent performances and outperforms
other state-of-the-art models."
131,PTGF: Public Transport General Framework for Identifying Transport Modes Based on Cellular Data,"Abstract—Public transportation is beating heart of a city. Un-
derstanding how citizens utilize public transportation can be used
to optimize many applications such as trafﬁc planning, crowd
ﬂow prediction and location-based marketing. However, obtaining
how citizens used transportation is not a trivial task. It is almost
not possible to ask citizens to report their exact location and their
transportation mode; moreover, there are usually various public
transportation that move along the similar paths. These increase
challenges to identify people’s transport modes. To address these
issues, this paper proposes Public Transport General Framework
(PTGF) to identify people’s transport modes by their cellular data
in both ofﬂine and online manners. Regarding the ofﬂine phase,
given historical cellular data of people and urban transportation
networks, PTGF derives cellular data into trajectories, to match
each trajectory to public transportation networks to ﬁnd the most
possible transport modes for sub-trajectories of a trajectory. In
the online phase, given streaming trajectories, PTGF identiﬁes the
transport modes of each location by a LSTM which are trained
by historical trajectories with transport modes annotated in the
ofﬂine phase. Extensive experiments are conducted by using both
synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results show that
the accuracy of PTGF in ofﬂine phase around 80% and that in
online phase F1-score around 0.7, which could prove that the
effectiveness of the proposed framework PTGF."

132,A Simple Chickpea Grain Moisture Measurement System,"Abstract—Different varieties of chickpea grains are har-
vested extensively in Indian subcontinent. Moisture mea-
surement in chickpea grains is essential in maintaining the
seed quality, its food value, crops harvest, and to prevent
wastage. There is no dedicated moisture meter for chickpeas.
This article investigates capacitive sensors to evaluate the
moisture content of various chickpea grains. Two different
types of capacitors, such as a dual parallel plate and a single
parallel plate, are designed and fabricated with proper care of
parasitic capacitances in a cost-effective manner. Experiments were conducted on four types of grains, such as brown
chickpea (small and medium size), green chickpea, and Kabuli (big size) to determine the electrical response parameters
at 100-kHz frequency with moisture variation from 8% to 30% (weight). The sensor capacitance value and the moisture
content of grains are correlated linearly. Finally, the sensor was interfaced to an electronic circuit to calibrate the voltage
signal to display moisture directly. The key distinguishing features of the sensors are high sensitivity, high precision
[average standard deviation (SDV) < 0.05%], and inexpensive fabrication. The calibration curves can be used to measure
moisture as well as type of grains (identification). The relative permittivity of the grain can be directly determined using
the double parallel plate sensor. The method adopted for measurement is simple, fast, and nondestructive."
132,A Novel Dual-Slope Resistance to Digital Converter With Lead Resistance Compensation,"Abstract— A
novel
dual-slope
resistance
to
digital
con-
verter (RDC) for compensating lead resistance is presented.
The RDC uses a dual-slope analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
structure along with three switches and a diode. It completes mea-
surement in one charging–discharging cycle only, hence provides
an improvement to existing RDCs based on direct microcontroller
interfaces (DMIs), where two or three charging–discharging
cycles are required. Moreover, it incorporates the feature of
lead resistance compensation in dual-slope RDCs. The scheme
works by connecting the resistive sensor to the input terminal
of the integrator of the dual-slope ADC. In the charging path
(or mode), sensor resistance is presented along with a lead
resistance; and in discharging path, sensor resistance is bypassed,
and only lead resistance is there. The difference between the
RC time constant during these two modes is used to find the
sensor resistance. The diode is used to turn on a switch for
bypassing the resistive sensor. The diode voltage drop is not
there in the charging and discharging path, which is another
novelty. A detailed error analysis is also carried to evaluate the
performance of the scheme considering switch resistance, diode
voltage drop, voltage mismatch, and opamp noises. The scheme
works with low-value resistive sensors (≈100 ), a feature not
found in the existing dual-slope RDCs. The hardware prototype
of the proposed scheme on the breadboard shows a measurement
time of 2.09 ms with an average error of ±0.04% at 100  when
lead resistance varied from 20 to 100 . The scheme takes 23.44%
less time for measurement."
132,Condition Monitoring of Transformer Breather Using Smart Photodiodes Array,"Abstract— A self-dehydrating silica-gel breather is an essential
part of any transformer to prevent moisture ingress of oil. In this
article, an online breather health monitoring system is developed
using a smart photosensors array and a humidity sensor. The
developed system monitors the change in primary components
of the intensity of the color (red, green, and blue) of silica gel at
different humidity levels. A smart photodiode array (TCS230) is
interfaced with the microcontroller to convert the color change
into a frequency change of pulse wave signal. Actual humidity
and the desiccant (silica gel) color change inside the breather
are monitored using the humidity sensor and the photosensors
array respectively. The developed experimental setup is tested on
a 200-kVA transformer silica-gel breather in the laboratory. The
maximum and minimum uncertainty in the measurement of color
intensity of the silica gel with humidity varying from 19%RH
to 59%RH was found 0.47 and 0.18, respectively. The method
is simple, noninvasive, durable, and inexpensive and it is not
reported anywhere to the best of our knowledge. The proposed
method may be used to monitor the saturation level of silica gel
inside the breather to protect the power transformer from excess
moisture contamination."

a unique application of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) res-
onator for developing a capacitive humidity sensor. A single
port resonator has a planar interdigital electrode (IDE) on
a piezoelectric substrate. A hydrophilic thin sensing film of
titanium dioxide (TiO2) is deposited on the IDE to measure
relative humidity (%RH) in a moist gas over a wide dynamic

the electrical static and dynamic response parameters in the
presence of humidity at 1 kHz frequency. The sensor with TiO2 film has excellent sensing performances, such as high

132,An Efficient Wireless Sensor Network Based on the ESP-MESH Protocol for Indoor and Outdoor Air Quality Monitoring,"Abstract: The main aim of this work is to establish a sensor MESH network using an ESP-MESH
networking protocol with the ESP32 MCU (a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller) for indoor and outdoor
air quality monitoring in real time. Each sensor node is deployed at a different location on the college
campus and includes sensor arrays (CO2, CO, and air quality) interfaced with the ESP32. The ESP-
MESH networking protocol is a low-cost, easy-to-implement, medium-range, and low-power option.
ESP32 microcontrollers are inexpensive and are used to establish the ESP-MESH network that allows
numerous sensor nodes spread over a large physical area to be interconnected under the same wireless
network to monitor air quality parameters accurately. The data of different air quality parameters
(temperature, humidity, PM2.5, gas concentrations, etc.) is taken (every 2 min) from the indoor and
outdoor nodes and continuously monitored for 72 min. A custom time-division multiple-access
(TDMA) scheduling scheme for energy efﬁciency is applied to construct an appropriate transmission
schedule that reduces the end-to-end transmission time from the sensor nodes to the router. The
performance of the MESH network is estimated in terms of the package loss rate (PLR), package
fault rate (PFR), and rate of packet delivery (RPD). The value of the RPD is more than 97%, and the
value of the PMR and PER for each active node is less than"
132,Evaluation of a Cross-Conductance Sensor for Cement Paste Hydration Monitoring and Setting Time Measurement,"Abstract—In this article, a sensor for monitoring hydration
and detecting initial and ﬁnal setting timings of freshly mixed
cement paste is presented. It is a new application of a
cross-conductance sensor and possesses the advantages of
the cross-conductance approach, i.e., the output is sensitive
only to the conductivity of the medium other than the length of
the electrode. The new sensor overcomes several limitations
of the conventional Vicat apparatus (VA) and other existing
impedance-based schemes. The cross-conductance sensor
cell is designed with the help of ﬁnite element analysis.
The cell has four conductive electrodes separated by small
gaps. It is fabricated using inexpensive but reliable materials.
A simple measurement circuit is developed to obtain an
output due to a change in the conductance of the sensor
cell. The output of the sensor unit gives the conductance
versus time response of the sample. From the rate of change
of this output, the setting time of the cement paste samples
is determined. The proposed sensor is simple to realize and it
does not require calibration. The repeatabilityof the prototype
sensor unit is found to be"
132,A Direct AC Cross Conductive Sensor for Milk Quality Measurement,"Abstract—Milk adulteration by various impurities, such as
water, whey, and urea, and some other harmful chemicals is an
important issue in different countries in the world. Traditionally,
analytical instruments are used for milk quality analysis. These
instruments are accurate but these are complex, expensive, incon-
venient for ﬁeld use, and require laborious skilled procedures to
get the reading. Portable sensors-based instruments working on
direct/indirect transduction phenomena are also reported in the
literature. Most commonly, the conductive sensors with selective
sensing ﬁlms are used for detecting the milk impurities but
such sensors require calibration and show drift due to aging.
There is a need to develop a rapid, accurate, sensitive, and cost-
effective simple working detection system. This article presents
the theory, design, fabrication, and test results of an accurate
and simple working prototype model of an ac cross-conductance
sensor for milk adulteration detection. The structure of the
sensor has four conductive brass electrodes, arranged in the form
of a concentric cylinder, with narrow gaps among them. The
sensor was fabricated and tested in the laboratory environment
to analyze the quality of 1) drinking water having different total
dissolved solids (TDS) and 2) milk having different amounts
of impurities, such as water, whey, and urea. The sensor can
differentiate between pure and adulterated milk with signiﬁcant

132,Design and Fabrication of Fringing Field Capacitive Sensor for Non-Contact Liquid Level Measurement,"Abstract—Thecapacitive sensors are widely used for liquid
level measurement in different applications, but the contact
type capacitive sensors suffer from frequent maintenance
and drift of the sensor output. The present paper proposes a
simple noncontact interdigital (IDT) fringing ﬁeld capacitance
sensor for liquid level measurement. The sensor can be made
using ﬂexible /non-ﬂexible substrate, and it can be used to
measure the liquid level of the vessel for both planar and
non-planar surfaces. Theory of level measurement using the
sensor has been discussed. Four different IDT sensor (1-n-1)
conﬁgurationssuch as 1-1-1, 1-3-1, 1-5-1 and 1-11-1 have been
designed, analysed, simulated (ﬁnite element method), and
fabricated to measure water and insulating transformer oil
levels from 0 to 40 mm. The analytical expressions are derived
for 1-n-1 conﬁguration to estimate the value of capacitance
and the maximum ﬁeld penetration depth of the sensors. The
capacitance value of all four sensors varies almost linearly with the variation of liquid level. Experimental results show
that the sensitivity of the 1-5-1 IDT sensor is 40 fF/mm. Performances of the sensors were compared with other capacitive
sensors reported in the literature. The sensor is capable to detect the water level with a resolution of 0.1 mm."
132,A Novel Application of the Cross-Capacitive Sensor in Real-Time Condition Monitoring of Transformer Oil,"Abstract—This article presents the novel application of a
cross-capacitive sensor for monitoring insulation degradation of
transformer oil. The condition of insulating oil is determined by
measuring the variation of the moisture content and furfural
(2-FAL) concentration in the range of 0–60 ppm. The moisture
and 2-FAL are two important by-products formed due to the
degradation of cellulose paper used for insulating transformer
winding. In addition, a small concentration of moisture is always
trapped in oil as well as in paper. An accurate and precise capac-
itive sensor is developed that uses the cross-capacitive structure
proposed by Thomson and Lampard. The sensor is developed
using bulk brass material and it consists of four identical brass
electrodes that are separated by very small gaps. The sensor
has been tested at different concentrations of moisture, and
2-FAL in four insulating oil samples that are commonly used
in power transformers, and results are compared by a reference
meter. The maximum accuracy of the sensor with respect to
the commercial meter is 0.77% and the air cross-capacitance
value differs calculated absolute capacitance value by 3%. The
calibrated response shows a maximum error of 2%. The output of
the sensor is highly precise (±0.0026% for moisture, ±0.0028%
for 2-FAL), fast, drift-free, and the maximum nonlinearity of the
response is close to 2%. The maximum standard deviations (SDs)
for the measurement of the mineral oil moisture and 2-FAL
concentrations are 0.025 and 0.023, respectively. The sensor
response is independent of temperature variation."
132,untitled,"Abstract—A robust signal conditioning circuit for capacitive
sensors, based on the dual-slope and phase-sensitive-detection
technique, is presented in this article. The circuit is designed to
measure the capacitance of the leaky capacitive sensors. The
phase-sensitive-detection technique mitigates the effect of the
shunting conductance. In addition, the circuit is designed in
such a way that the error due to the parasitic/stray capacitance
on the measurement of the sensor capacitance is negligible.
Furthermore, an autotuning frequency-independent quadrature
phase-shifter circuit is designed for an accurate 90◦phase
generation. A prototype of the circuit is built and tested. The
experimental results show that the designed circuit can measure
the sensor capacitance in the range from 65 to 528 pF with accu-
racy within ±1%. The robustness of the proposed circuit is tested
against the variation in the amplitude and frequency of input
sinusoidal excitation signal. The results conﬁrm that the proposed
circuit is well suited for sensors, such as capacitive humidity

132,A Cross-Conductive Sensor to Measure Bottled Water Quality,"Abstract—Analysing the water quality is critical for food value 
and healthy human life. To ensure quality, there is a need to 
develop a rapid, accurate, sensitive and cost-effective simple 
working detection system. This paper presents the theory, 
design, fabrication and test results of an accurate and simple 
working proto-type model of water quality on cross-
conductance technique. It is small in size and simple in design 
and can be prepared at low cost. The sensor and the associated 
electronic circuit may be prepared in compact form using 
integration techniques. The structure of the sensor is simple 
having four conductive brass electrodes, arranged in the form 
of a concentric cylinder, with narrow gaps among them. The 
structure was designed using ANSYS software, then simulated 
using ANSYS MAXWELL 3D software by varying the 
geometric dimensions and liquid conductivity. Experimental 
results, on a compact proto- type model, were also included. It

132,The Oxide Film-Coated Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators for the Measurement of Relative Humidity,"Abstract—The surface acoustic wave (SAW) humidity sensor
may possess many attractive sensing characteristics such as high
sensitivity, high resolution, high stability, frequency output, ease
of interfacing, small size, and broad dynamic range. Mostly,
the polymer materials are used for the SAW humidity sensor
fabrication. But the polymer SAW sensors suffer from broad
bandwidth, instability due to ambient temperature, nonlinearity,
and small dynamic range. This article presents the fabrication
of metal oxide ﬁlm humidity sensors using SAW resonators of
433.92-MHz frequency. Five different SAW humidity sensors were
fabricated by varying the deposited alumina ﬁlm thickness to
measure humidity in the range of 0%–98% relative humidity
(RH). The hydrophilic ﬁlms were formed by dip coating of alu-
mina solution of different molar concentrations. The alumina ﬁlm
is thermally stable and inert. The static and dynamic response
characteristics were determined from the shift in resonant peaks
at different humidity using an HP 85046A vector network
analyzer (VNA). The minimum sensitivity of the least sensitive
sensor was found to be 2.51 kHz/%RH. The sensors show linear
response (R2 ≥0.98), high sensitivity (max. ∼9 kHz/%RH),
negligible hysteresis error (≤0.50%), wide dynamic range, and
inexpensive fabrication due to the use of commercial resonators.
The response parameters of the sensors were compared with the
parameters of other oxide SAW sensors reported in the literature.
Finally, the linear sensor was interfaced to the electronic and
associated signal conditioning circuits to display humidity in
%RH.

132,High-Precision Capacitive Sensors for Intravenous Fluid Monitoring in Hospitals,"Abstract—Automatic detection of the presence of intravenous
ﬂuids (IVs) and measuring their drip rates are essential for
intelligent health care applications. Conventionally, the drip rate
is monitored manually by a gravimetric method that suffers
from several drawbacks. Some smart commercial drip systems,
which mostly work on the optical technique, have inaccuracy
due to external light interference, temperature variation, and
misalignment of a photodiode and photodetector. The main
motivation of this work is to investigate the usefulness of the
capacitive sensors for the noncontact detection and measurement
of ﬂow rates of IV ﬂuids. There is no previous work on IV drop
detection by the capacitive sensors. This article investigated
three types of capacitive sensors, such as a cross capacitive,
a semicylindrical, and a planar parallel plate to detect the
presence of IV droplets in the ﬂuid pipe nondestructively. The
sensors are specially designed to fulﬁll the application needs, and
simulated and fabricated with inexpensive double-sided copper-
cladded ﬂexible PCB substrates. Experiments are conducted with
the sensors for four IV ﬂuids typically used in hospitals to
determine their response parameters, such as precision, drift,
and drop rate, when the droplet passes through the inner electric
ﬁeld of the sensors. There is an instantaneous change in the value
of capacitance due to a sudden change in the dielectric constant
of a partially ﬁlled air medium. The distinctive capacitance peak
enables to count the droplets, drip rate (0.4-m/s cross capacitive)
with highly precise (0.036%), and drift-free readings. All the
sensors can be used for the target application, but the cross
capacitive sensor has single dimension accuracy."
132,A High Precision Cost-effective Ultrasonic Sensor for Detection of Gas Leakage in Gas Insulated Switchgear,"Abstract— This paper presents modelling and testing of an 
ultrasonic sensor for detection of SF6 gas leakage from vessels of 
gas insulated switchgears (GISs) with less than 0.5% margin. As 
per industry standard and practices, the desired level of gas 
leakage is to be kept below 0.5% per annum per in the SF6 gas 
vessel. Detection of gas density using acoustic signals was found 
suitable due to its good electrical properties in ideal gases. This 
unique arrangement helps in detection of gas leakage at ppm-
level where the live conductors and other electrical equipment 
inside the GIS are surrounded by Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) 
gas. Performances and stability of the ultrasonic sensor have 
been evaluated in presence of some influencing parameters such 
as pressure, temperature, molar mass, humidity. The cost 
effectiveness of the sensor is ensured because of its simple 
modelling and robust design."

A real-time location tracking system (RTLTS) for material flow and workers is important for many manufacturing 
and service facilities. In this work, a novel framework is proposed to enable the optimal deployment of access points 
(APs) for indoor RTLTS. To this end, two different wireless sensor networks of radio frequency identification (RFID) 
and ultra-wideband (UWB) are considered for zone detection and localization, respectively. In the proposed 
framework, both area and tag covering problems are addressed to find the optimal number and placement of APs for 
RFID and UWB based RTLTS. An algorithm is developed utilizing the geometrical approach to solve the area 
coverage problem. To address the tag covering problem, an optimization model is developed, which is solved by a

132,Investigation of Chip Temperature on Response Characteristics of the Humidity Sensor From ppm to &#x0025;RH,"Abstract—Many research articles are reported on humidity
measurement in the literature. But there is no critical study of
temperature on the response characteristics of the humidity sen-
sors, particularly in ppm-level. Developing an experimental set
up for studying the temperature effect is challenging as the vari-
ation of the ambient temperature not only varies the response
of the sensor but also the humidity level inside the chamber.
Commercial humidity-controlled chamber to maintain humidity
and temperature is bigger in size and costly. Purposes of the
present work are (i) to investigate the chip temperature effect on
the characteristics of metal oxide humidity sensors in ppm level
and in %RH (ii) to enhance the sensitivity of a sensor by suitably
controlling its temperature in ppm level (iii) to refresh the sensor
by intermittent heating pulse. A suitable experimental set up is
also developed to study the temperature effect on the sensors.
The chip temperature may be another method to enhance the
sensitivity in low ppm moisture detection."

(AN-Z2V)
signal
conditioning circuit for resistive–capacitive (R-C) sensors. The
proposed technique takes advantage of the reuse of the phase
tracking and autonulling modules to extract the in-phase and
quadrature components of the sensors. The circuit is designed
for three sensing modes: 1) Mode-C for capacitive sensors
with leakage resistor; 2) Mode-R for resistive sensors with
parasitic shunt capacitor; and 3) Mode-Z for impedance R-C
sensor. A novel autotuning quadrature phase generator circuit
is designed and implemented for the generation of reference 90◦
phase-shifted signal for the leaky capacitive sensors. A prototype
of the proposed circuit is fabricated and tested. Measurement
results show that AN-Z2V provides the measurement range with
low relative error compared with the reported systems. The
system is tested for a range of 10–760 pF and 56 k–6.5 M for
mode-C and mode-R, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed
circuit is found to be ±0.11% and ±0.07% for mode-C and
mode-R, respectively. The capacitance and resistance of the
impedance R-C sensor are simultaneously measured in mode-Z
for a range of 33–528 pF and 100 k–7.8 M, respectively.

Sensitivity is an important parameter of any humidity sensor.
In recent times, nanostructure materials have been used to
fabricate the capacitive-type humidity sensors to improve the
sensitivity. However, for the nanostructure sensors, in most
cases, the sensitivity improvement is not guaranteed although
extra efforts are made in terms of time and cost. Our aim is to
improve the sensitivity of an anodized porous alumina capaci-
tive humidity sensor by a simple method. A nanostructure
porous film has been formed on each side of a pure alumi-
num substrate (99% purity) by an electrochemical anodization
method. Two parallel plate capacitors are formed by deposit-
ing metal plate on each side of the metal oxide film with bulk
aluminum as the common electrode. The sensitivity has been
increased by connecting the two parallel plate capacitive sen-
sors in parallel. Thus, two capacitive sensors on single sub-
strate are fabricated and connected in parallel to form the
third capacitor, which is used as the humidity sensor. The sen-
sitivity, response time, recovery time, and hysteresis of the
sensors are determined with variation in the range from 10%
to 99% relative humidity (RH). The sensitivity of the sensor
obtained by connecting two capacitors in parallel has been
increased by almost two times compared to the sensitivity of
an individual sensor fabricated on each side."

sensor is fabricated with inexpensive materials. The sensor is a
parallel plate capacitor, in which the dielectric material poly-

works on the principle that the density of sensing layer decreases
with an increase in temperature following the Clausius–Mosotti
equation, because of which the permittivity also decreases.
Moreover, the thickness of the sensing layer also increases with
an increase in temperature due to a positive coefﬁcient of linear
expansion. The sensor is tested in the range of 20 ◦C–200 ◦C
and shows a mean sensitivity (μ) of 156 fF/◦C with standard

dependence of the piezoceramic element performances on the
aspect ratio, i.e., the ratio between thickness and diameter, is
analyzed with the aim of maximizing the energy conversion. To
the end, the effective electromechanic coupling factor (keff),
which is a parameter that can be easily measured, is the
investigated parameter. Results obtained with analytical and FE

the thickness and the diameter of the piezoceramic element are

(3.6 GHz) the antenna shows a circularly polarized behavior, 
whereas in case of the other band it is acting as a linearly 
polarized component. The design geometry consists of a CPW-fed 
thin slot structure with an LC complimentary resonator loaded 
at the end of the CPW trace line. The resonator is loaded at an 
offset of 0.5 mm with respect to the center of the CPW-trace to 
realize the circular polarization. The structure is simulated and

introduced on both the sides of the waveguide for the purpose 
of reducing the cross-pol radiation and the results are

135,ScienceDirect,"Abstract 
Medical images acquired at different institutions have different data distributions due to varying scanners, imaging protocols, or 
patient cohorts. Thus, normalizing samples before using them to train the Deep Learning (DL) models is an essential task. Scholars 
have used various normalization methods to normalize mammograms. However, which normalization method works best on 
mammograms and if it can help training generalize the DL model has not been analyzed in the literature. This paper presents a 
comparative analysis of commonly used normalization methods, such as scaling, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram 
Equalization (CLAHE), and Z-score normalization on mammograms for breast mass segmentation tasks. We trained the Attention 
Unet model on INbreast and the subset of the Cohort of Screen-Aged Women dataset (CSAW-S). We performed cross-dataset 
analysis on trained models to investigate how normalization methods helped train robust models to handle diverse datasets. Our 
results suggest that the normalizing method of input data affects the segmentation model's performance. We achieved the best 
scores with the Z-score normalization closely followed by CLAHE. However, further investigation suggests that the normalization 
method’s performance may depend on the variability of mammograms in the dataset. Results of cross-dataset analysis suggest the 
importance of choosing the normalization method for consistent DL model performance. To our knowledge, this study represents 
the first systematic analysis of the performance of prevalent normalization techniques on a diverse dataset of mammogram images. 
The insights gained from our experiments can guide the selection of normalization methods for improved mass segmentation 
accuracy.

135,Segmentation of Nuclei in H&#x0026;E-Stained Histological Images using Deep Learning Framework: A Perspective on Ensemble Approach and Nuclei Count,"Abstract— Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cell 
nuclei in histopathological images have significant importance 
in the detection and grading of cancer and other pathologies. 
In the era of digital pathology and whole slide imaging, 
automated cell nuclei segmentation is essential for evaluating 
histopathological images. For that, the deep learning-based 
approach currently become the popular approach. In the 
present work, we evaluated the impact of various stain 
normalization preprocessing and homogenous ensemble deep 
learning models for cell nuclei segmentation and their counting 
in hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained histopathological 
images. We used the Squeeze U-Net model for nuclei 
segmentation 
and 
performed 
comparative 
analysis 
on 
Reinhard, Macenko and Vahadane stain normalization 
techniques. 
Reinhard 
stain 
normalization 
technique 
outperforms Macenko and Vahadane in within- and cross-
dataset analysis. The ensemble model approach showed 
comparable or lower nuclei counting error than without the 
ensemble approach. We observed that the better dice score, 
was not always results in better nuclei counting accuracy."
135,Impact of Stain Normalisation Technique on Deep Learning based Nuclei Segmentation in Histopathological Image,"Abstract—Cell nuclei count and morphology are the key 
parameters in the histopathological image for evaluating 
various 
pathological 
conditions. 
However, 
the 
manual 
extraction of these parameters is a tedious and time-consuming 
task. Automated nuclei segmentation is the practical solution. 
Deep learning-based approaches have recently become popular 
for automated nuclei segmentation tasks in histopathological 
images. 
Stain 
colour 
variability 
frequently 
occurs 
in 
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological images 
because of differences in the staining process and digitisation 
medium. A deep learning-based approach is susceptible to data 
variability; therefore, data augmentation and normalisation are 
crucial 
pre-processing 
steps 
to 
improve 
the 
model's 
generalisation.   In the present work, we performed the 
comparative analysis of the colour augmentation and stain 
normalisation techniques, namely Reinhard, Macenko and 
Vahadane, for deep learning-based nuclei segmentation tasks in 
H&E stained histopathological images. We have used three 
different datasets and performed within-dataset and cross-
dataset analysis to evaluate the trained model's generalisation 
capabilities. Stain normalisation methods, e.g. Reinhard and 
Vahadane, showed better performance in various datasets than 
colour augmentation techniques."
135,Vocal/Music Classification using Incremental Learning Approach,"Abstract—Multimedia Data Content Labeling has been a
research area for a relatively long period. Researchers have
spent a substantial amount of time classifying video sequences,
music genres, and artists’ classiﬁcation domains. vocal/music
tagging is prevalent in this ﬁeld, but it is addressed chieﬂy
in Western music. This paper mainly focuses on the music-
vocal binary classiﬁcation of every 15-seconds window of the
Indian songs, speciﬁcally in the Hindi language. The increasing
amount of data recorded by the Hindi song industry shows that
old methods are not efﬁcient enough for tagging. Incremental
learning has been used quite widely now in multimedia data
content labeling. This paper proposes an incremental learning-
based approach developed explicitly for binary classiﬁcation
based on Hindi songs. The proposed algorithm is developed
for music-vocal classiﬁcation. The incremental learning approach
showed signiﬁcantly good results. Moreover, there are not enough
datasets available for performing such tasks for Hindi songs.
Thus, this paper also introduced a novel dataset containing
window-based information labeled for each song for each artist.
The proposed method achieved remarkable accuracy of 83.6%
for music vocal classiﬁcation. Cross-Language Testing is also
performed to check if the model generalizes over other language
songs."
135,Assessment of Emerging Graphene based Network-on-chip for Integrated Circuit Design,"Abstract—Network-on-chip (NoC) has evolved as new 
paradigm for high-dense interconnect configurations in advanced 
integrated circuit designs. The increasing number of transistor 
cores with decrease in chip area is the leading motivation behind 
em- ployment of NoC over system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. 
NoC provides re-configurable interconnections between different 
cores in the SoC design. It maximizes data transfer speed and 
reduction in wiring congestion. For further effective performance 
enhancement of NoCs, it is envisaged that incorporation of 
graphene material can be good for realizing interconnects. In 
this paper, edge traffic distribution (ETD) algorithm is explored 
along with magnificent graphene based interconnects for NoC 
design. Performance parameters considered are delay, power, 
energy and throughput. It is investigated that the ETD routing 
algorithm leads to reduced delay, higher throughput, and smaller 
packet loss. Further it is analyzed that graphene based NoC leads 
to smaller energy consumption for the link connecting two routers. 
The assessment of NoC structures has been performed using 
Noxim and SPICE electronic design automation tools."
135,Magnetoencephalographic study of event‐related fields and cortical oscillatory changes during cutaneous warmth processing,"Abstract
Thermoreception is an important cutaneous sense, which plays a role in the maintenance of our
body temperature and in the detection of potential noxious heat stimulation. In this study, we
investigated event-related fields (ERFs) and neural oscillatory activities, which were modulated by
warmth stimulation. We developed a warmth stimulator that could elicit a warmth sensation, with-
out pain or tactile sensation, by using a deep-penetrating 980-nm diode laser. The index finger of
each participant (n 5 24) was irradiated with the laser warmth stimulus, and the cortical responses
were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The ERFs and oscillatory responses had
late latencies ("

comparison of single-phase diode-bridge rectifier and the 
proposed front-end converter in terms of the Total Harmonic 
Distortion (%THD) of the line current, power factor of the 
system and ability of energy saving of the converter by 
capability of reverse power flow action. The parameters of the 
voltage control-loop for proposed converter are derived by two 
methods named Unity Modulus (Magnitude Optimum) method 
and Ziegler-Nichols method. The parameters obtained from 
both the methods are compared by the mathematical model for 
forward and reverse power flow mode of operation. The model 
is generated in Simulink toolbox of MATLAB and results are 
obtained for steady state, transient and dynamic conditions. It is 
observed that the unity power factor is maintained during all the 
conditions for various loads. Drastic reduction in %THD of 
input current waveform is obtained in proposed power supply 
with an added advantage of regenerative capability. For 
comparison of results of control-loops, a programming file (M-
file) is also generated in MATLAB and from the same file the 
step-response and Nyquist plots are obtained for system 
control-loops. The experiment results are also obtained for the 
prototype converter in inverter mode. The power system 
friendliness of the proposed front-end converter is quite evident 
from the results presented in the paper.

The Tuberculosis Eradication and Awareness Drive (TBEAD) project introduced a ground breaking 
solution to bolster medication adherence within the context of Tuberculosis (TB) management. 
Focused on the critical post-diagnosis phase, our primary goal was to develop a seamless system for 
monitoring medication adherence, recognizing its pivotal role in preventing disease recurrence and 
its potentially fatal consequences. The resulting innovation, the Smart Pill Dispensing and Tracking 
system, has not only met but exceeded our initial expectations. 
Our achievements in this endeavour are notable:"

139,vipin_etal.pdf,"Abstract
We used satellite-derived sea-surface-temperature (SST) data along with in-situ data collected
along a meridional transect between 18.85 and 20.25◦N along 69.2◦E to describe the evolution
of an SST ﬁlament and front during 25 November to 1 December in the northeastern Arabian
Sea (NEAS). Both features were ∼100 km long, lasted about a week, and were associated with
weak temperature gradients (∼0.07◦C km−1). The in-situ data were collected ﬁrst using a
suite of surface sensors during a north–south mapping of this transect and showed the existence
of a chlorophyll maximum within the ﬁlament.
This surface data acquisition was followed
by a high-resolution south–north CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) sampling along the
transect.
In the two days that elapsed between the two in-situ measurements, the ﬁlament
had shrunk in size and moved northward. In general, the current direction was northwestward
and advected these mesoscale features. The CTD data also showed an SST front towards the
northern end of the transect. In both these features, the chlorophyll concentration was higher
than in the surrounding waters.
The temperature and salinity data from the CTD suggest
upward mixing or pumping of water from the base of the mixed layer, where a chlorophyll
maximum was present, into the mixed layer that was about 60 m thick. A striking diurnal
cycle was evident in the chlorophyll concentration, with higher values tending to occur closer
to the surface during the night. The in-situ data from both surface sensors and CTD, and so
also satellite-derived chlorophyll data, showed higher chlorophyll concentration, particularly at
sub-surface levels, between the ﬁlament and the front, but there was no corresponding signature
in the temperature and salinity data. Analysis of the SST fronts in the satellite data shows that
fronts weaker than those associated with the ﬁlament and the front had crossed the transect in
this region a day or two preceding the sampling of the front."

139,Prediction of daily sea surface temperature using artificial neural networks,"ABSTRACT
We present an artiﬁcial neural network model to predict the sea
surface temperature (SST) and delineate SST fronts in the northe-
astern Arabian Sea. The predictions are made one day in advance,
using current day’s SST for predicting the SST of the next day. The
model is used to predict the SST map for every single day during
2013–2015. The results show that more than 75% of the time the
model error is ≤±0.5ºC. For the years 2014 and 2015, 80% of the
predictions had an error ≤±0.5ºC. The model performance is
dependent on the availability of data during the previous days.
Thus during the summer monsoon months, when the data avail-
ability is comparatively less, the errors in the prediction are slightly
higher. The model is also able to capture SST fronts.

139,Untitled,"Abstract
Wavelet analysis of altimeter sea level in the Indian Ocean shows regions of high
variability (maxima) and low variability (minima) at all time scales. At interan-
nual time scales, i.e., at periods of 17 months or more, minima are seen at several
places: in the central equatorial Indian Ocean; in the Arabian Sea along the south
and west coasts of India and Sri Lanka, along the northern boundary, in the Gulf
of Aden, and in patches along the coast of Oman; and in the Bay of Bengal along
the east coasts of Sri Lanka and India south of ∼10◦N, and in the southern bay
east of the Sri Lanka thermal dome. We investigate the cause of these interannual
minima using a linear, continuously stratiﬁed numerical model, which is able to
simulate the observed minima. We separate the forcing into a set of processes:
direct forcing by winds in the interior ocean, forcing by winds blowing along con-
tinental boundaries, and forcing by Rossby waves generated by the reﬂection of
equatorial Kelvin waves at the eastern boundary. At interannual periods, min-
ima (maxima) of interannual variability occur where the direct wind forcing and
reﬂected Rossby waves interfere destructively (constructively). At interannual pe-

riods within the tropics, the adjustment time scale of the system is less than that
of the forcing, leading to a quasi-steady balance, a property that distinguishes the
interannual minima from those at annual and semiannual time scales. Idealised
solutions show that the presence of India forces the minimum along the Indian
west coast, and that it extends around the perimeter of the Arabian Sea into the
Gulf of Aden.

The effect of lanthanum doping is studied on ferroelectric properties of Ba1–xLaxTiO3 with 
x = 0⋅⋅0005, 0⋅⋅001, 0⋅⋅003 prepared through solid state sintering route. Dielectric and impedance spectroscopic 
studies have been carried out. The tetragonal distortion of the unit cell decreased and ferroelectric transition 
temperature, Tc increased with the increase of lanthanum content. 
 Combined impedance and admittance spectroscopy was used to analyse impedance data. The electromechani-
cal parameters were calculated from the resonant and anti-resonant frequencies from vector admittance plots. 
The electromechanical coefficients for Ba1–xLaxTiO3 with x = 0⋅⋅003 were found to be much larger than that of 
pure barium titanate."
139,bamsd170197 1..17,"ABSTRACT: A good understanding of the general circulation features of the oceans, particularly 
of the coastal waters, and ability to predict the key oceanographic parameters with good accuracy 
and sufficient lead time are necessary for the safe conduct of maritime activities such as fishing, 
shipping, and offshore industries. Considering these requirements and buoyed by the advance­
ments in the field of ocean modeling, data assimilation, and ocean observation networks along 
with the availability of the high-performance computational facility in India, Indian National Centre 
for Ocean Information Services has set up a “High-Resolution Operational Ocean Forecast and 
Reanalysis System” (HOOFS) with an aim to provide accurate ocean analysis and forecasts for the 
public, researchers, and other types of users like navigators and the Indian Coast Guard. Major 
components of HOOFS are (i) a suite of numerical ocean models configured for the Indian Ocean 
and the coastal waters using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for forecasting physi­
cal and biogeochemical state of the ocean and (ii) the data assimilation based on local ensemble 
transform Kalman filter that assimilates in situ and satellite observations in ROMS. Apart from 
the routine forecasts of key oceanographic parameters, a few important applications such as (i) 
Potential Fishing Zone forecasting system and (ii) Search and Rescue Aid Tool are also developed 
as part of the HOOFS project. The architecture of HOOFS, an account of the quality of ocean 
analysis and forecasts produced by it and important applications developed based on HOOFS are 
briefly discussed in this article.

ccurate forecasts of specific oceanographic parameters such as currents, temperature, 
and salinity in the surface and subsurface ocean, tides, and wind waves are essential 
for planning most of the maritime activities and securing the lives and livelihoods of 
millions of people who venture into oceans (Francis et al. 2013). The users of the operational 
ocean forecasts and information range from traditional fisher folks to high-tech maritime 
industries. Recognizing the importance of accurate predictions of oceanographic parameters, 
particularly for the waters around India, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of 
India, entrusted Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) to design, 
develop, and operate a comprehensive, very high-resolution ocean forecast and analysis/
reanalysis system. This led to the development of a High-Resolution Operational Ocean 
Forecast and Reanalysis System (HOOFS)—the operational ocean forecast system of India. 
The architecture of HOOFS, important products and applications of this system, and verifica­
tion of the ocean analysis and forecasts generated by it are briefly discussed in this paper.
A good understanding on the circulation of the Indian Ocean in general, and coastal waters 
around India in particular, is a prerequisite for designing and developing a forecast system for 
the Indian Ocean. Tides, which are responsible for a substantial fraction of variability observed 
in currents and sea level in the coastal regions, are mixed semidiurnal in the Arabian Sea (AS) 
and predominantly semidiurnal in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) (Sindhu and Unnikrishnan 2013). 
Tidal currents over wide continental shelves in the northern BoB and off the west coast of India 
have comparable magnitudes and sometimes stronger than the subtidal currents, suggesting 
their importance in the ocean dynamics of this region (Mandal et al. 2020; Subeesh et al. 2013; 
Unnikrishnan et al. 1999). Though tidal currents are not prominent in the open ocean, their 
interactions with bottom topographic features generate internal gravity waves (internal tides), 
which significantly influence the vertical mixing (Nash et al. 2004; Waterhouse et al. 2014), 
sediment suspension (Butman et al. 2006), and biological productivity in the ocean (Pingree 
et al. 1986, Sharples et al. 2009). Studies suggest that Chagos–Laccadive Ridge and Andaman–
Nicobar (AN) Ridge are the two important sources of internal tides in this region and internal 
tides generated here propagate all over the southeastern AS and BoB, respectively (Jithin et al. 
2019, 2020, 2017a; Subeesh 2019). Jithin et al. (2019) have shown that a substantial variability of 
the internal tides observed off the east coast of India are driven by those originating from the 
AN Ridge, which is located about 1,000 km away from the coast. Apart from tides, presence 
of coastally trapped waves (CTW) is an important feature observed along the Indian coasts,

which causes significant variability 
in the currents and sea level on the 
continental shelf (Amol et al. 2012; 
Shetye and Vijith 2013). Studies have 
shown that the CTWs are often linked 
to winds blowing hundreds of kilo­
meters away from the regions they 
are seen (Amol et al. 2012; N. Anup 
et al. 2020, unpublished manuscript).
The subtidal circulation of the 
northern Indian Ocean is primarily 
driven by the monsoon winds, which 
have characteristic seasonal reversal. 
The prominent features of the upper-
ocean circulation in the northern 
Indian Ocean thus reverses season­
ally along the west and east coasts of 
India and in the open seas (Shankar 
et al. 2002). During the summer mon­
soon (June to September), the West 
India Coastal Current (WICC) flows 
equatorward while the East India 
Coastal Current (EICC) flows pole­
ward. The direction of WICC and EICC 
turn poleward and equatorward, 
respectively, during winter mon­
soon (November to January; Shetye 
et al. 1993, 1991, 1990). The strong 
monsoon currents seen to the north 
of the equator flow eastward during 
the summer monsoon and westward 
during the winter monsoon (Shankar 
et al. 2002; Shenoi et al. 1999). It may 
be noted that, in addition to the local 
surface forcing, the coastal circulation around India is highly influenced by remote forcing 
from the interior Bay of Bengal and the equatorial Indian Ocean (Potemra et al. 1991; Shankar 
et al. 1996; Yu et al. 1991). The interplay between these different forcing mechanisms makes the 
surface and subsurface circulation along the Indian coasts highly incoherent (Amol et al. 2014; 
McCreary et al. 1993; Mukherjee et al. 2014; Shankar et al. 2002). Recent observations based on 
coastal radar data suggest that variability in the boundary currents, for instance, EICC, signifi­
cantly influences the currents even at the coast (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2017).
Another important feature of both EICC and WICC is the existence of strong undercurrents 
beneath the strong surface flow (Amol et al. 2014; Mukherjee et al. 2014; Shetye et al. 1991). In 
a recent study, Francis et al. (2020) have shown that the undercurrents in the EICC are formed 
due to the interaction of westward-propagating mesoscale eddies with topography. It may 
be noted that the mesoscale eddy activity in the BoB is very strong and they play important 
roles in the variability of EICC and the circulation in the interior BoB (Chen et al. 2018). It 
has also been shown that the variability of isothermal layers in the interior Bay of Bengal 
is also influenced by the winds over the equatorial Indian Ocean through remote effects 
(Girishkumar et al. 2013). Recent studies have suggested that the AN Islands play an important 
A brief history of the HOOFS
INCOIS started issuing basin-scale forecasts of a few oceanographic 
parameters such as SST, mixed layer depth, surface currents, and 
depth of the 20°C isotherm based on a relatively low-resolution (1/4°) 
Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) configuration for the Indian 
Ocean from January 2010. This forecast system, which was named as 
“Indian Ocean Forecast System” (INDOFOS), was run at an in-house 
high-performance computing (HPC) facility with a modest computing 
capacity of 7.1 TF. Major drawbacks of this system were its low spatial 
resolution and the lack of a data assimilation system to initialize 
the forecast model. In the absence of data assimilation, the “ocean 
analysis” was nothing but a free model forced with atmospheric 
analysis and the initial conditions for every day forecast were taken 
from previous days “ocean analysis.” The open boundary conditions 
at the southern and eastern boundaries were relaxed to climatological 
tracer and geostrophic velocity fields. Tides were also not incorpo­
rated in this system. The model was forced with 6-hourly atmospheric 
forecast fields obtained from the GFS configuration of NCMRWF, with 
a resolution of 1/4°. The spatial resolution of INDOFOS was upgraded 
to 1/8° in March 2012 (Francis et al. 2013). To make a comprehensive 
operational forecast system, which includes high-resolution ocean 
general circulation models with realistic open boundary conditions and 
data assimilation schemes, INCOIS started the HOOFS project in 2012 
with a budget allocation of about $12 million for the 5-yr period during 
2012–17 and continued further as “Ocean Modeling Data Assimilation 
and Process Specific Observations” (O-MASCOT) project with a budget 
allocation of about $3 million during 2017–20. The success of the 
project was stemmed with the installation of the HPC facilities, initially 
of about 125-TF capacity at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology 
(IITM), Pune, and subsequently about 930-TF capacity at NCMRWF 
dedicated for the research and development of HOOFS project. INCOIS 
started providing global ocean analysis also based on the GODAS 
in 2010, which was originally developed by the National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP). In addition to providing the lateral 
boundary conditions for IO-HOOFS, INCOIS-GODAS also provides the 
oceanic initial conditions for the seasonal prediction of Indian monsoon 
using Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2; Rao et al. 2019).

role in the accurate simulation of subtidal circulation in the Bay of Bengal (Chatterjee et al. 
2017; Mukherjee et al. 2019).
Designing forecast systems for regional waters, particularly for the coastal oceans, poses sev­
eral challenges due various factors including the complex bathymetry and coastline, interaction 
of coastal circulation with local and remote forcing, and availability of suitable atmospheric forc­
ing fields. Apart from these, a unique feature of Bay of Bengal is the discharge of large quantities 
of freshwater from the rivers like Ganga and Brahmaputra, which causes strong stratification in 
the upper ocean that limits the mixed layer to a few tens of meters and influencing the circula­
tion significantly (Vinayachandran and Kurian 2007). Inclusion of river discharge data in real 
time in high-resolution operational forecast models still remains as a challenge. In general, 
the operational agencies configure a series of ocean forecast systems, nested in larger-scale 
forecast/analysis systems to meet the specific requirements of regional applications. A good 
example of such a system is a national network of operational nowcast and forecast hydrody­
namic model systems designed and operated by NOAA (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/models
.html). This system includes several regional-scale configurations of hydrodynamic models for 
the coastal waters, bays, and larger lakes in and around the United States to issue the nowcast 
and forecasts up to 48 h lead time. There are several similar high-resolution operational forecast 
systems for other parts of coastal waters and marginal seas in Australia, Asia, and Europe (a 
complete list of such systems can be found at www.godae-oceanview.org/science/task-teams/coastal
-ocean-and-shelf-seas-tt/coss-tt-system-information-table/). The domains of most of such systems 
are restricted to the regions of their interests (Tonani et al. 2015). The unique dynamics of the 
coastal waters in the Bay of Bengal 
and the Arabian Sea suggests that, 
the models configured for simulat­
ing and predicting the variabil­
ity of circulation in the northern 
Indian Ocean, particularly in the 
coastal waters around India, need 
to be carefully designed to ac­
count for the effects of both local 
and remote forcing. At the same 
time, as most of the users require 
ocean circulation forecasts for the 
coastal waters, these models have 
to be configured at sufficiently high 
horizontal resolution to resolve 
the coastal processes with good 
accuracy. The major challenge 
faced during the configuration of 
HOOFS was, thus, the selection of 
the domain of model setups to bal­
ance these requirements, without 
compromising the quality of the 
model simulations. At the same 
time, it may also be noted that the 
approach taken in the design of 
HOOFS is quite similar to the other 
operational systems, as seen from 
the discussion in the following 
section.

 We report seasonal and temporal variation of total organic carbon (TOC) in the eastern Arabian Sea 
(AS). In comparison to the deep, TOC in the top 100 m showed spatial variation with higher 
concentrations towards northern AS during North east monsoon (NEM) and South west monsoon 
(SWM). A comparison with the US-JGOFS data (1995) shows warmer temperatures, enhanced TOC 
and low chlorophyll in the recent years. High TOC is associated with Arabian Sea high saline waters 
(ASHSW), advected from the Arabian Gulf, might have resulted in an enhancement of TOC in the 
eastern AS. This excess TOC supports a high abundance of bacteria despite the low primary 
productivity. TOC oxidation accounted for 14.3% and 22.5% of oxygen consumption for waters with 
potential density between 24.5 to 27.3 kg/m3. This study attains great significance considering the 
missing links with respect to the role of transport processes in ocean deoxygenation under ongoing 
warming scenarios."

We use data from moorings equipped with Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁlers
(ADCPs) and deployed in the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India from May
2009 to February 2012 to study the near-inertial currents (NICs) on the continental
shelf and slope. The data show that the NICs are much weaker at the shelf break
than on the slope. Inertial energy is weak all along the east coast during January–
April. It is high during the summer monsoon (May–September) in the northern
Bay of Bengal and early during the winter monsoon (October–December) in the
southern bay; at locations in the central bay, the inertial energy does not show
this seasonality. This difference between the northern and southern bay is due
to the seasonality in the occurrence of storms, which tend to occur in the north
(south) during the summer (winter) monsoon. Variability across years is evident
in the three-year record, with the NICs being weaker during 2010–2011 compared
to 2009. Upward phase propagation is evident in the data, indicating downward

NICs extend below the thin surface mixed layer in the bay. A comparison of the
NICs amplitude with that of the detided (residual) current shows that the NICs
make a signiﬁcant contribution to the observed current on the east-coast slope:
the magnitude of the NICs exceeds that of the residual current on the slope in the
northern and southern Bay of Bengal on over 10 days in a year, respectively."

139,1,"Abstract 
Productivity is low in tropical waters outside the traditional upwelling regimes, making temperature 
fronts a potential marker of fish.  To test the hypothesis that all temperature fronts harbour high 
concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass, several fronts were sampled during winter 
2014 in the northeastern Arabian Sea (NEAS). The data suggest that all the sampled temperature 
fronts are active biological spots owing to injection of subsurface nutrients into the surface layer.   
The plankton response, however, varied, with enhanced zooplankton biomass (total bacterial counts) 
in the shelf (open-ocean) fronts, suggesting that classical (microbial) food webs are active.  The 
plankton response depended on the age of the front, and, more importantly, the initial or background 
conditions under which a front forms. Determination of the initial conditions for a front is 
complicated owing to advection by the mean current and mesoscale eddies and this advection itself 
modulates the background conditions. An increase in integrated Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), but not 
surface Chl-a, was observed in both shelf and open-ocean fronts, suggesting that depth –integrated  
Chl-a  is likely to be a better marker of potential fishery zones (PFZs). This study suggests that the 
PFZ advisories may be improved by including depth-integrated Chl-a, the age of the front, and 
background conditions in the procedure."

In the present study, using in-situ and satellite observations, we investigate the influence of 
physical processes on the enhancement of phytoplankton biomass in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). 
Water column measurements were carried out from 9⁰N to 21⁰N (stations II-2 to II-14) along 68⁰E 
transect in the EAS during the beginning of fall intermonsoon (FIM) of 2014. Both in-situ and 
satellite-derived chlorophyll a (Chl a) showed higher biomass at 15⁰N (station II-8) compared to 
northern and southern stations. We explored the possible physical processes which can lead to high 
biological productivity at this station. Our study shows that nearly two times enhancement in Chl a at 
station II-8 was contributed by an open-ocean front, which occurred two days before the 
measurement. Based on phytoplankton marker pigments, it was evident that haptophytes were 
abundant at II-8 with a minor contribution from diatoms and dinoflagellates. This condition also led 
to a high concentration (4.9 nM) of dimethylsulphide (DMS), an anti-green house gas with a net flux 
of 3.76 µmol m-2d-1 at this site. Among the picophytoplankton, Synechococcus were abundant at this 
station, however Prochlorococcus were absent as confirmed by both marker pigment and flow 
cytometric counts. The case study presented here demonstrates the dynamic nature of open ocean 
fronts and their overall contribution to the productivity of the eastern Arabian Sea during the 
oligotrophic inter-monsoon period."

Metastatic breast cancer is a significant clinical challenge calling for novel and 
efficient therapeutic approaches. DNA tetrahedron, a highly programmable nanocage, offers 
some promising attributes including biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization making it 
an attractive candidate for drug delivery. In this study, we have explored the potential of 
DNA tetrahedron as a carrier of doxorubicin, a DNA and RNA synthesis-inhibiting 
chemotherapy drug. We have encapsulated doxorubicin in DNA tetrahedron (TD: Dox) and 
subsequently focused on metastatic breast cancer cells for the effect of the same. We 
showed that TD: Dox has the potential to inhibit the migration of cancerous cells in the 2D 
model and inhibit the invasion of tumor cells in the 3D model as well. This system also can 
be uptaken in in vivo zebrafish model as well. Overall, this study promises the TD: Dox 
system as an ideal drug delivery model and a viable approach for metastatic breast cancer 
treatment."

excellent free radical (DPPH) scavenging activity, proving their role as antioxidants. This 
further opens up doors for various other plant and biomedical applications to be targeted using 
these CNPs."

Cancer is a complex disease, with multiple treatment modalities, but no definitive cure. 
The tumor microenvironment contributes to the complexity of the disease by forming a niche 
of multiple cell types supporting each other to carry out various cellular functions. Tumor 
associated macrophages are one such kind of cells which support the tumor 
microenvironment via immunosuppression. DNA tetrahedron (TD), a widely explored DNA 
nanocage, has shown a lot of potential in therapeutics. However, the role of TD still remains

drug delivery applications. DNA molecules stand out among various biomaterials due 
to their unparalleled precision, programmability, and customization. In this study, we 
introduce a palate of novel cellular scaffolding platforms made of pure DNA-based 
hydrogel systems while improving the shortcomings of the existing platforms. DNA 
strands can form complex supramolecular branched structures essential for designing 
novel functional materials by its precise sequence-based self-assembly. These unique 
geometric scaffolds offer a soft, cushiony platform, ideal for culturing cells to mimic the 
complex native in vivo environments better. Each hydrogel comprises repeating units 
of branched DNA supramolecular structures, each possessing a distinct number of 
branching arms. The epithelial cells grown over these hydrogels show dynamic 
changes at multiple levels, from morphology to protein expression patterns, enhanced 
membrane traffic, and proliferation. The DNA hydrogels explored here are 
mechanically weak and soft and thus appropriate for applications in cell biology. This 
research lays the groundwork for developing a DNA hydrogel system with a higher 
dynamic range of stiffness, which will open exciting avenues for tissue engineering 
and beyond.

140,Self-assembled DNA-collagen bioactive scaffolds promote cellular uptake and neuronal differentiation,"Abstract: Different modalities of DNA-Collagen complexes have been utilized 
primarily for gene delivery studies. However, very few studies have investigated the 
potential of these complexes as bioactive scaffolds. Further, no studies have 
characterized the DNA-Collagen complex formed from the interaction of self-
assembled DNA macrostructure and collagen. Towards this investigation, we report 
herein the fabrication of novel bioactive scaffolds formed from the interaction of 
sequence-specific, self-assembled DNA macrostructure and collagen type I. Varying 
molar ratios of DNA and collagen resulted in highly intertwined fibrous scaffolds with 
different fibrillar thicknesses. The formed scaffolds were biocompatible and presented 
as a soft matrix for cellular growth and proliferation. Cells cultured on DNA/Collagen 
scaffolds promoted enhanced cellular uptake of transferrin, and the potential of 
DNA/Collagen scaffolds to induce neuronal cell differentiation was further investigated. 
The DNA/Collagen scaffolds promoted neuronal differentiation of precursor cells with 
extensive neurite growth in comparison to control groups. These novel, self-
assembled DNA/Collagen scaffolds could serve as a platform for the development of 
various bioactive scaffolds with potential applications in neuroscience, drug delivery,

140,2D MXene-DNA Hybrid Hydrogel for Thrombin Detection: A Versatile Approach for Biomedical Sensing,"Abstract: The delaminated MXene (2D MXene) and DNA hydrogel created enormous 
opportunities due to their versatility and ability to be tailored for specific applications. MXene 
offers high aspect ratio morphology and electrical conductivity, while DNA provides stimuli 
responsiveness and specificity in binding to ligands or complementary sequences. This 
synergy makes DNA an ideal actuator when combined with 2D MXenes. Present work makes 
the first effort to combine and exploit them for detecting the thrombin levels; a crucial 
proteolytic enzyme that plays a pivotal role in regulating blood clotting by cleaving fibrinogen 
into fibrin and plays a critical role in bleeding disorders such as Haemophilia and Von 
Willebrand disease. This study introduces a novel hybrid DNA hydrogel by leveraging the 
properties of 2D MXene with a thiol-modified thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) as a crosslinking 
agent. The TBA and its complementary DNA oligos are immobilized on 2D MXene sheets, 
forming a packed hydrogel. Upon thrombin binding, the TBA releases its complementary DNA, 
resulting in a loosened hydrogel and a change in resistance, which is used as a read-out for 
thrombin detection. The concept is successfully demonstrated, achieving 90-92% accuracy in 
detecting thrombin in artificial samples. This robust technique holds promise for biomedical 
sensing devices, allowing customization for the detection of various target molecules using 
specific aptamers."

inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while 
effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. 
This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery 
of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition 
of the NF-κB pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and 
biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved 
mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly 
inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor

angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques at different temperatures. These scattering approaches provide an insightful 
information on the micelle size and shape. The size variations in self-assembled micelles designated the micelles to undergo 
growth/transition in shape from spherical to elongated ellipsoidal as function of temperature. Additionally, the application 
of these nanoscale micellar aggregates as carriers for delivering the anticancer drug Quercetin (QCT) was undertaken by a 
thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis to gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of the mix-micellar system as

millions of human lives worldwide. Despite advancements in conventional treatments like surgery,
chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, the rise of multidrug resistance, tumor recurrence, and their
severe side effects and the complex nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) necessitates in-
novative therapeutic approaches. Recently, stimulus-responsive nanomedicines designed to target
TME characteristics (e.g., pH alterations, redox conditions, enzyme secretion) have gained attention
for their potential to enhance anticancer efficacy while minimizing the adverse effects of chemother-
apeutics/bioactive compounds. Among the various nanocarriers, hydrogels are intriguing due to
their high-water content, adjustable mechanical characteristics, and responsiveness to external and
internal stimuli, making them promising candidates for cancer therapy. These properties make hydro-
gels an ideal nanocarrier for controlled drug release within the TME. This review comprehensively
surveys the latest advancements in the area of stimulus-responsive hydrogels for cancer therapy,
exploring various stimuli-responsive mechanisms, including biological (e.g., pH, redox), chemical
(e.g., enzymes, glucose), and physical (e.g., temperature, light), as well as dual- or multi-stimuli

especially as a nanocarrier. TD is highly programmable, biocompatible, and capable 
of cell differentiation and proliferation. It also has tissue and blood-brain barrier 
permeability, making it a powerful tool that could overcome potential barriers in treating

idiopathic scoliosis. Though the deformity exists in 3D, its diagnosis is currently carried out with the
help of 2D radiographs due to the unavailability of an efficient, low-cost 3D alternative. Computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not suitable in this case, as they are
obtained in the supine position. Research on 3D modelling of scoliotic spine began with multiplanar
radiographs and later moved on to biplanar radiographs and finally a single radiograph. Nonetheless,
modern advances in diagnostic imaging have the potential to preserve image quality and decrease
radiation exposure. They include the DIERS formetric scanner system, the EOS imaging system, and
ultrasonography. This review article briefly explains the technology behind each of these methods.
They are compared with the standard imaging techniques. The DIERS system and ultrasonography
are radiation free but have limitations with respect to the quality of the 3D model obtained. There is a
need for 3D imaging technology with less or zero radiation exposure and that can produce a quality
3D model for diseases like adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Accurate 3D models are crucial in clinical
practice for diagnosis, planning surgery, patient follow-up examinations, biomechanical applications,

Several practical applications like disaster detection, remote surveillance, object recognition using remote sensing satellite

these applications computational complexity of the algorithm play a vital role along with accuracy. In this work image
segmentation is dealt as a clustering problem and a bio-inspired algorithm based on the behavior of ‘Roller Dung Beetles
(RDB)’ is proposed to determine effective solutions. The beauty of this proposed RDB Clustering architecture is its lower
computational complexity O(N). The software implementation of the proposed algorithm is carried out in MATLAB
environment and a hardware architecture is developed in Verilog HDL using Modelsim, Xilinx ISE for FPGA environment.
The architecture has a comparison free sorting module, two data storage modules and a parallel threshold comparator
unit, all of which use fewer mathematical operations. The performance of the proposed architecture is validated on many
synthetic and standard benchmark color images. Further application of the proposed architecture is carried out for real-
time segmentation of 8 NASA LANDSAT / ESA satellite images. Performance comparison has been carried out with other
existing architectures based on Artificial Immune System (AIS), Genetic, K-means clustering, CNN etc. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed RDBC architecture is 42% faster than the K-Means implementation with a clock frequency of
230.52MHz with an increased PSNR of 6.825% and SSIM of 15.55%. Statistical analysis and silhouette index also confirms
the superiority of new clustering architecture over existing implementations.Compared to CNN the RDBC architecture is
economical both in terms of lower chip-area and power consumption."

on hyperspectral image processing, brain tumor detection (Biomedical), facial
recognition (Biometric), object tracking (Video analysis), etc. In this manuscript,
the color image segmentation is dealt as a clustering problem. A genetic algorithm
(GA)-based hardware architecture is proposed to perform the segmentation task in
a fast manner. Testing of the proposed architecture is carried out on four standard
RGB color images like Pepper, Baboon, Lenna, and Colorbars. Comparison with
three other benchmark architectures of genetic algorithm reveals that the proposed
architecture provides satisfactory results in terms of complexity, system clock fre-
quency, and resource utilization. The three other architectures used for comparison
are compact implementation of GA, used for simple optimization tasks, whereas
the proposed one is used for clustering huge number of pixels within an image, for
executing the task of segmentation."
141,A low complexity hardware architecture of K-means algorithm for real-time satellite image segmentation,"Abstract
The Real time monitoring of forest area, coastal regions, sea, river basins, nation borders etc.
helps in quick determination of devastations caused by natural or man-made catastrophes,
which can lead to emergency situations. Real-time Segmentation of satellite images is essential
to detect fire, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes etc. of a specific geographical zone. Effective
determination of such calamities and taking proactive measures can save a lot of lives and
natural resources. In this paper, an efficient FSM based architecture is proposed for performing
segmentation of satellite Images procured from NASA’s Operational Land Imager (OLI) on
Landsat 8 and Landsat 5. The K-means clustering algorithm even after five decades of it’s
existence is quite effective and mostly used for big data applications, owing to its lower
complexity. However, it’s effective implementation has started only in the last couple of years.
Here a FSM-based reconfigurable architecture is proposed for K-means algorithm taking into
consideration the real-time segmentation of satellite Images. Compared to other architectures
in the literature, the proposed one has reduced hardware usage, lower area, power consumption
with a satisfactory clock frequency, most importantly it is reconfigurable and can be used with
the on-board circuitry within satellites. The testing is carried out on eight latest satellite images
of natural and human devastations, taken from NASA’s OLI. The number of possible clusters
within the geographical image is studied with the help of histogram analysis based on Otsu’s
thresholding method. The performance analysis is carried out by computing the Peak Signal to
Noise (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (M-SSIM) of the resultant clusters. It is
observed that by increasing the number of clusters, the detailed classes were effectively
segmented and the quality of clustering is ensured by the improvement in PSNR and M-
SSIM values. Comparison of the obtained clusters with their true land features also yielded
satisfactory results."

the development of hardware architectures for several real-life
applications including image segmentation. Accurate analysis
of segmented high-resolution satellite image help in identifying
ﬂood, ﬁre, cloud, snow, and other natural phenomenons. In this
paper, an improved genetic clustering architecture is proposed by
introducing innovative architectures for crossover and mutation
modules. In this architecture, complexity is low due to the use
of Manhattan distance instead of traditional Euclidean distance.
Testing of the proposed architecture has been carried out on
two satellite captured ﬂood images of Myanmar, Burma 2015,

successfully segmented and obtained satisfactory PSNR and

In this paper, we obtained the optimal transaction throughput for a Proof-of-Work (PoW) based
longest chain rule blockchain network (called bitcoin protocol). This is done by modeling the delay

that are being commonly used in most wireless communication
systems. In this paper we examine the coexistence of the above
schemes through a two user communication system, i.e., one user
transmits using CDMA and the other transmits using OFDM.
Using an OFDM based receiver, we derive the received symbols
at the output of each branch of the OFDM demodulator. The
symbols transmitted by the CDMA user are then detected using
the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) approach,
an array processing technique commonly used in beamforming.
Through simulations, we then show that the MPDR method is
indeed very efficient in suppressing the OFDM interference.

gain in a Rayleigh fading channel. We use maximal ratio
combining (MRC) in the transmitter-repeater link and space-time
coding (STC) in the repeater-receiver link, where the repeater
has two antennas for transmission as well as reception. The
repeater transmits at a higher rate than the transmitter so
that the symbols are properly synchronized. We then derive
the closed-form expression for the probability of bit error and
show that there exists a trade-off between the bit error rate
(BER) performance and the transmit powers of the transmitter
and the repeater. Based on our BER curves, we then show that
the performance of the proposed system is much better than a
conventional repeater as well as the traditional communication
system."

that the diversity order for the MIMO Relay cooperative system

a factor M from that of a system with single-antenna relays.
Simulation results conﬁrm that the analytical expressions for

illuminance. Regular arrays and random geometries are considered for an arrangement of the
source LEDs. Uniform illuminance is accomplished by considering the variance of the received
power on the receiver plane as metric and framing it as a convex optimization problem. Numerical
results show that the quality factor of random geometries are superior to ﬁxed geometries. While
preserving uniformity, the cost of the system can be reduced when random geometries are used.

The delays introduced by each upstream node and link can

144,Pedestrian Detection in 3D Point Clouds using Deep Neural Networks,"Abstract
Detecting pedestrians is a crucial task in autonomous
driving systems to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestri-
ans. The technologies involved in these algorithms must be
precise, robust and reliable, regardless of environment con-
ditions. Relying solely on RGB cameras may not be enough
to recognize road environments in situations where cameras
cannot capture scenes properly. Some approaches aim to
compensate for these limitations by combining RGB cam-
eras with Time Of Flight (TOF) sensors, such as Light De-
tection and Ranging (LIDAR), which map the scene into 3D
point clouds using pulses of light. However, there are few
works that address this problem using exclusively the 3D
geometric information provided by LIDARs.
In this paper, we propose a PointNet++ based architecture
to detect pedestrians in dense 3D point clouds. The aim is
to explore the potential contribution of geometric informa-
tion alone in pedestrian detection systems. PointNet++ is
a deep neural network that learns global and local features
of a point cloud from its geometry. This allows discern-
ing the different patterns that characterize each class. In
our case, the network must learn to classify pedestrians, so
we need to carry out supervised training using accurately
labeled pedestrian and non-pedestrian point cloud clusters
as input. Therefore, we also present a semi-automatic la-
beling system to generate a point cloud dataset with ground
truth. The labeling system transfers pedestrian and non-
pedestrian labels from RGB images onto the 3D domain.
The fact that our datasets have RGB registered with point
clouds enables label transferring by back projection from
2D bounding boxes to point clouds, with only a light man-
ual supervision to validate results. We train PointNet++
with the geometry of the resulting 3D labelled clusters.
The evaluation conﬁrms the effectiveness of the proposed
method, yielding precision and recall values around 98%.
This corroborates the hypothesis stated in the paper that
3D geometric information is essential for a neural network
to learn to detect pedestrians in outdoor scenes, thus prov-
ing that LIDAR sensors should be a must in these systems."
144,"Citation: deMas-Giménez, G.;","Abstract: Fog, haze, or smoke are usual atmospheric phenomena that dramatically compromise
the overall visibility of any scene, critically affecting features such as illumination, contrast, and
contour detection of objects. The decrease in visibility compromises the performance of computer
vision algorithms such as pattern recognition and segmentation, some of them very relevant for
decision-making in the ﬁelds of security and autonomous vehicles. Several dehazing methods have
been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, all proposed metrics in the literature compare
the defogged image to its ground truth for evaluation of the defogging algorithms, or need to estimate
parameters through physical models. This fact hinders progress in the ﬁeld as obtaining proper
ground truth images is costly and time-consuming, and physical parameters greatly depend on
the scene conditions. This paper aims to tackle this issue by proposing a gradient-based metric for
image defogging evaluation that does not need a ground truth image or a physical model. The
proposed metric only requires the original hazy RGB image and the RGB image obtained after the
defogging procedure. A comparison of the proposed metric with metrics already used in the NTIRE
2018 defogging challenge is performed to prove its effectiveness in a general situation, showing
comparable results to conventional metrics. A Matlab implementation of the proposed metric can be

144,Untitled,"Abstract
Due to the outstanding characteristics of LiDAR imaging systems, they seem essen-
tial for the consolidation of novel applications related to computer vision, in fields such
as autonomous vehicles, outdoor recognition, and surveillance. However, the final
technology implementation still has some uncertainties and needs in-depth work for its
use in these real-world applications. Under the presence of adverse weather conditions,
for example in fog, LiDAR performance is heavily influenced and the quality of the
detection becomes severely degraded. The range is reduced due to the dispersion of the
media and the sensor could be saturated due to backscattering or deliver a very limited
range. Light propagation modeling through turbid media is used as a tool to understand
and study these phenomena. Mie Theory allows the characterization of the optical
media and light-particle interactions. Monte-Carlo methods are used to solve the radia-
tive transfer problem related to these situations. When working with those models, the
results obtained are in accordance with the ones shown in experimental tests, and it is
possible to predict the necessities and problems of the designed systems."
144,Experimental Characterization of Polarized Light Backscattering in Fog Environments,"Abstract: This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of the polarization behavior of
light backscattered through fog. A polarimetric orthogonal state contrast imager and an active,
purely polarized white illuminator system are used to evaluate both linear and circular polarization
signals. The experiments are carried out in a macro-scale fog chamber under controlled artiﬁcial fog
conditions. We explore the effect of backscattering in each imaging channel, and the persistence of
both polarization signals as a function of meteorological visibility. We conﬁrm the presence of the
polarization memory effect with circularly polarized light, and, as a consequence, the maintenance
of helicity in backscattering. Moreover, the circular cross-polarized channel is found to be the
imaging channel less affected by fog backscattering. These results are useful and should be taken into
account when considering active polarimetric imaging techniques for outdoor applications under
foggy conditions."

144,Generalized multi-cavity laser self-mixing interferometry based on scattering theory,"Abstract: We present a generalized mathematical model and algorithm for the multi-cavity
self-mixing phenomenon based on scattering theory. Scattering theory, which is extensively used
for travelling wave is exploited to demonstrate that the self-mixing interference from multiple
external cavities can be modelled in terms of individual cavity parameters recursively. The
detailed investigation shows that the equivalent reflection coefficient of coupled multiple cavities
is a function of both attenuation coefficient and the phase constant, hence propagation constant.
The added benefit with recursively model is that it is computationally very efficient to model
large number of parameters. Finally, with the aid of simulation and mathematical modelling, we
demonstrate how the individual cavity parameters such as cavity length, attenuation coefficient,
and refractive index of individual cavities can be tuned to get a self-mixing signal with optimal
visibility. The proposed model intends to leverage system description for biomedical applications
when probing multiple diffusive media with distinct characteristics, but could be equally extended
to any setup in general.

144,Biaxial Piezoelectric MEMS Mirrors with Low Absorption Coating for 1550 nm Long-Range LIDAR,"Abstract: This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of a biaxial MEMS (MicroElectroMe-
chanical System) scanner based on PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) which incorporates a low-absorption
dielectric multilayer coating, i.e., a Bragg reﬂector. These 2 mm square MEMS mirrors, developed on
8-inch silicon wafers using VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology are intended for long-range
(>100 m) LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) applications using a 2 W (average power) pulsed
laser at 1550 nm. For this laser power, the use of a standard metal reﬂector leads to damaging over-
heating. To solve this problem, we have developed and optimised a physical sputtering (PVD) Bragg
reﬂector deposition process compatible with our sol-gel piezoelectric motor. Experimental absorption
measurements, performed at 1550 nm and show up to 24 times lower incident power absorption than
the best metallic reﬂective coating (Au). Furthermore, we validated that the characteristics of the PZT,
as well as the performance of the Bragg mirrors in terms of optical scanning angles, were identical to
those of the Au reﬂector. These results open up the possibility of increasing the laser power beyond
2W for LIDAR applications or other applications requiring high optical power. Finally, a packaged
2D scanner was integrated into a LIDAR system and three-dimensional point cloud images were
obtained, demonstrating the scanning stability and operability of these 2D MEMS mirrors."
144,Optical Technologies for the Improvement of Skin Cancer Diagnosis: A Review,"Abstract: The worldwide incidence of skin cancer has risen rapidly in the last decades, becoming
one in three cancers nowadays. Currently, a person has a 4% chance of developing melanoma, the
most aggressive form of skin cancer, which causes the greatest number of deaths. In the context
of increasing incidence and mortality, skin cancer bears a heavy health and economic burden.
Nevertheless, the 5-year survival rate for people with skin cancer signiﬁcantly improves if the
disease is detected and treated early. Accordingly, large research efforts have been devoted to
achieve early detection and better understanding of the disease, with the aim of reversing the
progressive trend of rising incidence and mortality, especially regarding melanoma. This paper
reviews a variety of the optical modalities that have been used in the last years in order to improve
non-invasive diagnosis of skin cancer, including confocal microscopy, multispectral imaging, three-
dimensional topography, optical coherence tomography, polarimetry, self-mixing interferometry,
and machine learning algorithms. The basics of each of these technologies together with the most
relevant achievements obtained are described, as well as some of the obstacles still to be resolved
and milestones to be met."
144,Sample manuscript showing specifications and style,"ABSTRACT   
The interest in LiDAR imaging systems has recently increased in outdoor ground-based applications related to computer 
vision, in fields like autonomous vehicles and surveillance. However, for the complete settling of the technology, there 
are still obstacles related to outdoor performance, being its use in adverse weather conditions one of the most 
challenging. When working in bad weather, data shown in point clouds is unreliable and its temporal behavior is 
unknown. That is why we have designed, constructed, and tested a scanning-pulsed LiDAR imaging system with 
outstanding characteristics related to optoelectronic modifications, in particular including digitization capabilities of each 
of the pulses. Our contribution is related to the digitization, analysis, and characterization of the acquired signal when 
steering to a target under foggy conditions, as well as the proposal of different strategies to improve point clouds 
generated in these conditions. The system performance was tested in a macro-scale fog chamber and, using the collected 
data, two relevant phenomena were identified. Firstly, the backscattering signal of light that first interacts with the 
media. It is usually responsible for the saturation of the sensor but signal analysis shows it may be easily filtered out. 
Secondly, false-positive points that appear due to the scattering properties of the media, which only add noise to the 
point cloud. Digitization of the complete signal can be used to develop algorithms to identify and get rid of them."
144,Optical method based detection and wavelets based processing of acoustic waves,"Abstract—Acoustic waves (AW) has been used for the testing
of static and dynamic structures. They contain the signature
about the performance of rotary machines such as cyclic fatigue,
friction, turbulence and cavitation. Thus has been extensively
used in the condition monitoring and material characterization.
In this paper, we present an algorithm based on wavelets to
process the transient AW in time and frequency domain both
simultaneously to extract its the temporal (e.g. time duration)
and spectral properties (e.g. emission frequency). Further, op-
tical method based on optical feedback (OF) is presented for
detection of AW providing powerful non-contact, non-destructive
diagnostic capabilities, which is safe, efﬁcient, cost-effective and
potential to be used in harsh conditions."

Dermatologists are starting to make use of Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on deep learning algorithms, which can 
provide them with an objective judgement during evaluation of equivocal lesions. DL algorithms can be trained to 
classify skin lesions with datasets of diverse nature like traditional RGB, clinical and dermoscopic images, or more 
experimentally, with images from other modalities, such as multispectral imaging. In this work, we have evaluated and 
customized the different DL approaches that exist in the state of the art to classify a dataset of +500 images acquired on 
skin lesions. The images were acquired with a staring multispectral imaging prototype in the visible and near-infrared 
ranges. The best results were obtained for a customized model VGG-16 that combined 3D convolutional layers, 3D max-
pooling layers and dropout regularization, leading to an overall accuracy of 71%."
144,A Preliminary Study of Deep Learning Sensor Fusion for Pedestrian Detection,"Abstract: Most pedestrian detection methods focus on bounding boxes based on fusing RGB with
lidar. These methods do not relate to how the human eye perceives objects in the real world.
Furthermore, lidar and vision can have difﬁculty detecting pedestrians in scattered environments,
and radar can be used to overcome this problem. Therefore, the motivation of this work is to explore,
as a preliminary step, the feasibility of fusing lidar, radar, and RGB for pedestrian detection that
potentially can be used for autonomous driving that uses a fully connected convolutional neural
network architecture for multimodal sensors. The core of the network is based on SegNet, a pixel-wise
semantic segmentation network. In this context, lidar and radar were incorporated by transforming
them from 3D pointclouds into 2D gray images with 16-bit depths, and RGB images were incorporated
with three channels. The proposed architecture uses a single SegNet for each sensor reading, and
the outputs are then applied to a fully connected neural network to fuse the three modalities of
sensors. Afterwards, an up-sampling network is applied to recover the fused data. Additionally, a
custom dataset of 60 images was proposed for training the architecture, with an additional 10 for
evaluation and 10 for testing, giving a total of 80 images. The experiment results show a training
mean pixel accuracy of 99.7% and a training mean intersection over union of 99.5%. Also, the testing
mean of the IoU was 94.4%, and the testing pixel accuracy was 96.2%. These metric results have
successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of using semantic segmentation for pedestrian detection
under the modalities of three sensors. Despite some overﬁtting in the model during experimentation,
it performed well in detecting people in test mode. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that the focus
of this work is to show that this method is feasible to be used, as it works regardless of the size of
the dataset. Also, a bigger dataset would be necessary to achieve a more appropiate training. This
method gives the advantage of detecting pedestrians as the human eye does, thereby resulting in
less ambiguity. Additionally, this work has also proposed an extrinsic calibration matrix method for
sensor alignment between radar and lidar based on singular value decomposition."
144,sensors,"Abstract: This paper presents a novel calibration method for solid-state LiDAR devices based on a
geometrical description of their scanning system, which has variable angular resolution. Determining
this distortion across the entire Field-of-View of the system yields accurate and precise measurements
which enable it to be combined with other sensors. On the one hand, the geometrical model is
formulated using the well-known Snell’s law and the intrinsic optical assembly of the system,
whereas on the other hand the proposed method describes the scanned scenario with an intuitive
camera-like approach relating pixel locations with scanning directions. Simulations and experimental
results show that the model ﬁts with real devices and the calibration procedure accurately maps their
variant resolution so undistorted representations of the observed scenario can be provided. Thus, the
calibration method proposed during this work is applicable and valid for existing scanning systems
improving their precision and accuracy in an order of magnitude."
144,Polarization memory effect: imaging through ,"ABSTRACT:  Polarization is an unexploited property of light that provide us additional 
information in very diverse fields. Hence, in the last decade the concept of polarimetric 
imaging has risen as a powerful tool for plenty of applications such as remote sensing, 
medical diagnosis, astronomy, transport and surveillance… This communication 
presents the capability of a Division of Focal Plane (DOFP) camera jointly with active 
polarized illumination to improve the contrast when imaging a scene in turbid media 
such as fog. Due to the polarization memory effect, using polarization-gating method 
allows detecting embedded objects with a lower signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, higher 
contrast when propagating through scattering media. In addition, the polarization 
signature reflected by the objects depends on their nature, since the index of refraction 
modifies the polarization response. This allows distinguishing different materials such 
as metal and dielectric under active polarization imaging even in hazard conditions as 
fog."
144,Gradient-Based Metrics for the Evaluation of Image Defogging,"Abstract: Fog, haze, or smoke are standard atmospheric phenomena that dramatically compromise
the overall visibility of any scene, critically affecting features such as the illumination, contrast, and
contour detection of objects. The decrease in visibility compromises the performance of computer
vision algorithms such as pattern recognition and segmentation, some of which are very relevant to
decision-making in the ﬁeld of autonomous vehicles. Several dehazing methods have been proposed
that either need to estimate fog parameters through physical models or are statistically based. But
physical parameters greatly depend on the scene conditions, and statistically based methods require
large datasets of natural foggy images together with the original images without fog, i.e., the ground
truth, for evaluation. Obtaining proper fog-less ground truth images for pixel-to-pixel evaluation
is costly and time-consuming, and this fact hinders progress in the ﬁeld. This paper aims to tackle
this issue by proposing gradient-based metrics for image defogging evaluation that do not require
a ground truth image without fog or a physical model. A comparison of the proposed metrics
with metrics already used in the NTIRE 2018 defogging challenge as well as several state-of-the-art
defogging evaluation metrics is performed to prove its effectiveness in a general situation, showing
comparable results to conventional metrics and an improvement in the no-reference scene. A Matlab
implementation of the proposed metrics has been developed and it is open-sourced in a public
GitHub repository."
144,Current Modulation Induced Stability in Laser Diode Under High Optical Feedback Strength,"ABSTRACT The back-reﬂection of emitted laser beam (optical feedback, also know as selfmixing) from
various external interfaces are sufﬁcient to cause instability, and prohibiting its use in various ﬁelds such as
communication, spectroscopy, imaging to name a few. So it is desirable to study the laser dynamics and
the conditions causing it to be stable in spite of strong optical feedback. With the aid of mathematical
formulation, simulation and backed by experimental evidences, it is demonstrated that the frequency
deviation of the laser emission due to current (intensity) modulation alters the dynamic state and boundary
conditions of the system such that even under large optical feedback strength, the laser may attain stability
and retain single modal state. The frequency deviation resulting from former is shown to modify the phase of
the system in opposite direction to that induced by the later, showing that there exists an optimal modulation
current which compensates the effect of optical feedback and may be used to retain the laser in single modal
stationary state. The method thus provides a methodology to avoid optical feedback-induced instability in
semiconductor lasers by using the proper amplitude of current (intensity) modulation."
144,Modelling polarized pulsed LiDAR signals in scattering media: an approach for optimizing systems in real-world scenarios,"Abstract: Adverse weather conditions present a primary challenge for ground-based LiDAR
imaging systems in outdoor applications. The use of polarization has been proposed as an effective
filtering mechanism. However, the number of potential situations is large, complex and difficult
to parameterize with accuracy. In such conditions, advanced simulation methods enable the
testing of different experimental configurations and the determination of the best possible setup.
With this purpose, a Monte Carlo algorithm is presented for modeling polarized pulsed LiDAR
signals in turbid media. This algorithm is designed for immediate applicability, incorporating
realistic media characterization and accounting for the attributes of existing prototypes. It allows
testing various experimental configurations, managing optical obstacles, adjusting polarization
arrangements, and different geometries of particles within the medium. The developed algorithm
accurately characterizes backscattering signals, revealing their dependence on medium properties.
A relationship between visibility and backscattering energy is identified, offering insights for
sensor optimization. Polarization analysis highlights the efficacy of circular polarization in
mitigating scattering effects and establishes a connection with the polarimetric characteristics
of imaged targets. The algorithm’s application to irregular particles reveals also an unexpected
behavior of polarized light, challenging established strategies. These diverse use cases exemplify
the algorithm’s capability to model real-world circumstances, emphasizing its significance in
predicting cutting-edge situations when designing optical systems for complex and demanding
outdoor scenarios.

144,Overview of Biofluids and Flow Sensing Techniques Applied in Clinical Practice,"Abstract: This review summarizes the current knowledge on bioﬂuids and the main ﬂow sensing
techniques applied in healthcare today. Since the very beginning of the history of medicine, one of the
most important assets for evaluating various human diseases has been the analysis of the conditions
of the bioﬂuids within the human body. Hence, extensive research on sensors intended to evaluate

ing by evaluating the image contrast of images taken in a controlled foggy environment. A small-scale
fog chamber has been designed and constructed to create the necessary controlled foggy environment.
A division-of-focal-plane camera of linear polarization and a linearly polarized light source has been
used for performing the experiments with polarized light. In order to evaluate the image contrast
of the different imaging modes, the Michelson contrast of samples of different materials relative to
their background has been calculated. The higher the image contrast, the easier it is to detect and
segment the targets of interest that are surrounded by fog. It has been quantitatively demonstrated
that polarimetric images present an improvement in contrast compared to conventional intensity
images in the situations studied."
145,am5b01530 1..8,"ABSTRACT: We report the fabrication of anisotropic super-
hydrophobic surface with dual-scale roughness by the deposition
of silver nanorods arrays on prestretched poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) using oblique angle deposition and subsequent release
of strain after the deposition, which resulted in the formation of
microbuckles/wrinkles. The amplitude and periodicity of the
wrinkles were tuned by varying the prestretching mechanical
strain (ε) applied to the PDMS ﬁlm from 0 to 30% prior to Ag
nanorods deposition. The peaks and valleys in the surface
topography of Ag nanorods arrays covered PDMS ﬁlms lead to anisotropic wetting by water droplet. The droplet is free to move
along the direction parallel to the wrinkles, but the droplet moving perpendicular to the wrinkles confront energy barrier leading
to wetting anisotropy. The anisotropic wettability was tuned from 22 to 37° for 10−30% prestretched PDMS ﬁlm. The dual scale
roughness (nanorods on micro wrinkles) was found to be responsible for the superhydrophobicity (contact angle ∼155°) of the
sample prepared for 30% prestretched PDMS ﬁlm in perpendicular direction. The wetting behavior of the Ag nanorods PDMS
ﬁlm surface was reversibly tuned by applying the mechanical strain, which induces the change in the microscale roughness
determined by amplitude (A) and periodicity (λ) of the buckles. Most interestingly, the water droplet also displayed the
anisotropy in the roll-oﬀangle. The eﬀect of diﬀerent A and λ on anisotropic wettability of Ag nanorods arrays/PDMS ﬁlm was
also demonstrated by lattice Boltzmann (LB) modeling. These ﬁndings may produce a promising way of controlling the direction
of liquid ﬂow such as in microﬂuidic devices and transportation of the microliter water droplets in a preset direction."

at the interface. Although similar instability develops for the case of a soft ﬁlm separating from a rigid
adherent, there are important diﬀerences in the two cases. For the single-ﬁlm case, the wavelength of
instability is independent of any material properties of the system, and it scales only with thickness of
the ﬁlm. For the two-ﬁlm case, a co-operative instability mode develops, which is a non-linear function of
the thicknesses and the elastic moduli of both ﬁlms. We investigate the development of such instability by
energy minimization procedures. Understanding the nature of this instability is important, as it aﬀects the
adhesive compliance of the system and thus the energy release rate in the debonding of soft interfaces.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used for the prediction of hydrodynmics

proposed coupled CFD model has been successfully validated against experimental kLa data. The 
optimal conditions for the bioreactor operation were identified as 200 RPM and 4 LPM. For kLa, 
the film theory (Ranz-Marshall) yielded the best prediction for kLa in the range of aeration and

146,Joint Transmit and Jamming Power Optimization,"Abstract—In this paper, we address the problem of joint
allocation of transmit and jamming power at the source and
destination, respectively, to enhance the long-term cumulative
secrecy performance of an energy-harvesting wireless commu-
nication system until it stops functioning in the presence of an
eavesdropper. The source and destination have energy-harvesting
devices with limited battery capacities. The destination also
has a full-duplex transceiver to transmit jamming signals for
secrecy. We frame the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov
decision process (MDP) problem and propose a reinforcement
learning-based optimal joint power allocation (OJPA) algorithm
that employs a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Since the opti-
mal algorithm is computationally expensive, we develop a low-
complexity sub-optimal joint power allocation (SJPA) algorithm,
namely, reduced state joint power allocation (RSJPA). Two other
SJPA algorithms, the greedy algorithm (GA) and the naive
algorithm (NA), are implemented as benchmarks. In addition,
the OJPA algorithm outperforms the individual power allocation
(IPA) algorithms termed individual transmit power allocation
(ITPA) and individual jamming power allocation (IJPA), where
the transmit and jamming powers, respectively, are optimized
individually. The results show that the OJPA algorithm is
also more energy efficient. Simulation results show that the
OJPA algorithm significantly improves the secrecy performance
compared to all SJPA algorithms. The proposed RSJPA algo-
rithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly
less computational complexity marking it the balanced choice
between the complexity and the performance. We find that the
computational time for the RSJPA algorithm is around 75 percent
less than the OJPA algorithm."

channel state information (CSI) rapidly becomes outdated due
to fast-changing channels. Opportunistic transmitter selection
based on current CSI for secrecy improvement may be outdated
during actual transmission, negating the diversity beneﬁt of
transmitter selection. Motivated by this problem, we propose
a joint CSI prediction and predictive selection of the optimal
transmitter strategy based on historical CSI by exploiting the
temporal correlation among CSIs. The proposed solution utilizes
the multi-task learning (MTL) framework by employing a single
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture that
simultaneously learns two tasks of predicting the CSI and select-
ing the optimal transmitter in parallel instead of learning these
tasks sequentially. The proposed LSTM architecture outperforms
convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture due to
its superior ability to capture temporal features in the data.
Compared to the sequential task learning models, the MTL
architecture provides superior predicted secrecy performance for
a large variation in the number of transmitters and the speed of
mobile nodes. It also offers signiﬁcant computational and memory
efﬁciency leading to a substantial saving in computational time
by around 40 percent."
146,Next Generation Wi-Fi: Deployment Guidelines and Benefits of Massive MIMO for the Enterprise,"Abstract—Wi-Fi technology is continuously evolving to keep
the pace with the fast-increasing demand for new digital services
and applications. In particular, Wi-Fi 6 is becoming widely
available in residential and enterprise scenarios supporting up
to eight spatial streams. At the same time, large antenna arrays
have already shown their ability and beneﬁts when serving a large
number of devices simultaneously. Since enterprise owners are
already upgrading their indoor private networks with the next
generation of Wi-Fi products, it becomes crucial to understand
the capacity limits and the beneﬁts associated to different de-
ployment strategies and large antenna array conﬁgurations. The
scope of this paper is to provide concrete insights to internet ser-
vice providers and enterprise owners on how to upgrade, deploy,
and efﬁciently operate their networks with next-generation Wi-Fi
access points, showing their potential performance improvements
and providing a set of clear guidelines.

146,Next Generation Wi-Fi Mesh for Indoor Residential Deployments,"Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the use of highly
directional, hybrid antenna arrays in residential Wi-Fi mesh
deployments to further improve their performance in challenging
conditions where high wall losses are encountered. We also
formulate a metric to quantify the quality of the Wi-Fi coverage,
and present a deployment procedure to automatically select
extender AP locations to maximise such metric. Using the
proposed deployment procedure, the performance of highly
directional, hybrid antenna arrays in residential Wi-Fi mesh
deployments is evaluated through simulations. Compared with
the benchmark of omni-directional antennas, we show that
using the proposed array increases the areas achieving peak
throughput by more than 3 times.

146,Design principles for ultra-dense Wi-Fi deployments,"Abstract—Future indoor networks need to provide broadband
services either by increasing bandwidth, using higher order mod-
ulations and high spatial reuse. To this end, ultra-dense Wi-Fi
networks need to be deployed. This work discusses the challenges
of ultra-dense Wi-Fi networks, where inter-AP distances are 5 m
or less, and discuss necessary requirements to maximize the high
spatial reuse of radio resources through the use of adaptive
Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) thresholds and downward
facing directional antennas. We also examine the signiﬁcant
impact of uplink transmissions, and present the necessary uplink
transmit power control in ultra-dense deployments to avoid the
interference coming from hidden nodes in neighboring APs. With
the proposed techniques and antennas in place, we show that
the limitations placed by high contention and interference in
ultra-dense deployments can be overcome to provide over 8×
gains in downlink throughput when compared with APs with
omni-directional and unadjusted CCA thresholds.

146,Coordination of SON Functions in Multi-Vendor Femtocell Networks,"Abstract
With the increase of network complexity, there 
is a high need for network management automa-
tion. This is achieved through SON principles that 
enable self-configuration, self-optimization, and 
self-healing. However, even though SON func-
tions are meant to be autonomous, a high level 
of coordination among them is required. To this 
end, efficient conflict detection and resolution 
techniques are needed, especially in multi-vendor 
deployments. This article presents a design togeth-
er with a sample implementation of a coordina-
tion scheme between three key SON functions in 
femtocell networks: cell ID assignment, coverage 
adjustment, and idle mode control. This ensures 
stability and continuity of the network operation 
even in a situation when the functions have con-
tradicting objectives. The solution is based on the 
Broadband Forum TR-069 protocol and is appli-
cable to multi-vendor networks. Simulation evalu-
ation has shown that SON coordination reduces 
mean cell ID conflicts by over 30 percent and, 
resulting from that, call drop probability by over 
40 percent"

146,Self-optimization of coverage and sleep modes of multi-vendor enterprise femtocells,"Abstract—The use of small cells is a promising way of provid-
ing the required capacity in future cellular networks through den-
siﬁcation. Self-organizing network (SON) techniques are required
in small cells, particularly in femtocells where plug-and-play user
deployments are used. However, these techniques have tended to
be implemented by vendors with proprietary algorithms that use
low-level UE measurements which are not easily accessible to
network operators. This makes the management of femtocells in
a multi-vendor environment difﬁcult. In this paper, we present a
centralized SON technique to perform load balancing, coverage
optimization and manage sleep modes that utilizes high-level
measurements made at the femtocells which are easily available
through the widely used TR-069 device management protocol
standard. This allows network operators the ﬂexibility of imple-
menting and coordinating the SON techniques in multi-vendor
femtocell deployments. We show that, despite the limited amount
of information used, the proposed solution is able to effectively
optimize the coverage in order to balance load and manage sleep
modes whilst ensuring that no coverage gaps occur.

that increases the spectral variation in satellite images. The objective of this paper is to review the commonly available 
methods for topographic correction. The spectral variation may reduce the accuracy of processes, such as surface 
topographical classification, which can limit the capability of autonomous remote sensing applications. Many have 
tried to reduce the effect of topography and achieved great success; however, most methods are complicated and require 
many parameters. The topographic correction methods can be categorized into two groups: empirical and physical 
methods. In this paper, a total of six empirical methods were reviewed, including Cosine correction (CC), Statistical-
Empirical (SE) correction, Minnaert (MIN) correction, Shepherd and Dymond’s (SD) Correction Method, Sun-canopy-
sensor (SCS) Models and Path Length Correction (PLC) Method. The algorithms and models used in the physical 
topographical correction method were also discussed. Parameters related to the topographic correction algorithm were 
reviewed in detail. This paper reviewed a total of six common topographic correction methods and seven assessment 
methods for topographic correction."

(XCO2) over peninsular Malaysia using statistical methods. Data from five atmospheric variables consisting of the aerosol 
asymmetry factor (AAF), aerosol optical thickness (AOT), temperature (temperature), water vapor (H2O vapor) and aerosol 
single scattering albedo (SSA) were utilized to develop a predictive XCO2 regression model using multiple linear regression 
(MLR) for examining the impacts of the atmospheric variables on the XCO2. The predictive XCO2 regression model highly 
correlates with atmospheric variables (R2 = 0.68 for Northeast Monsoon and R2 = 0.64 for Southwest Monsoon). The validation 
results show that XCO2 yielded a strong R2 for the Northeast Monsoon and Southwest Monsoon seasons, i.e., 0.84 and 0.83, 
respectively. The proposed regression model exhibited excellent agreement under different monsoon seasons in Peninsular 
Malaysia."
147,Spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires in the context of climate change: a review,"Abstract
Forest fires are sudden, destructive, hazardous, and challenging to manage and rescue, earning them a place on UNESCO’s 
list of the world’s eight major natural disasters. Currently, amid global warming, all countries worldwide have entered a period 
of high forest fire incidence. Due to global warming, the frequency of forest fires has accelerated, the likelihood of large 
fires has increased, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires have shown different trends. Therefore, the impact 
of climate change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires has become a hot issue in the field of forest fire research in 
recent years. Therefore, it is of great significance and necessity to conduct a review of the research in this area. This review 
delves into the interactions and impacts between climate change and the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires. To address 
this issue, scholars have mainly adopted the following research methods: first, statistical analysis methods, second, the estab-
lishment of spatiotemporal prediction models for meteorology and forest fires, and third, the coupling of climate models 
with forest fire risk forecasting models. The statistical analysis method relies on the analysis of historical meteorological 
and fire-related data to study the effects of climate change and meteorological factors on fire occurrence. Meanwhile, forest 
fire prediction models utilize technical tools such as remote sensing. These models synthesize historical meteorological and 
fire-related data, incorporating key meteorological factors such as temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and wind. The 
models revealed the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of fires, identified key drivers, and explored the interactions 
between climate change and forest fire dynamics, culminating in the construction of predictive models. With the deepening 
of the study, the coupling of climate models and fire risk ranking systems became a trend in the prediction of forest fire risk 
trends. Moreover, as the climate warms, the increased frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, snow 
and ice storms, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has accelerated forest fire occurrences and raised the risk of major 
fires. This review offers valuable technical insights by comprehensively analyzing the spatial and temporal characteristics of 
forest fires, elucidating key meteorological drivers, and exploring potential mechanisms. These insights serve as a scientific 
foundation for preventive measures and effective forest fire management. In the face of a changing climate, this synthesis 
contributes to the development of informed strategies to mitigate the escalating threat of forest fires."

The time series of AST in Tunis were investigated for temporal and spatial trends during study 
period over six climate stations each having sufficient data available were utilized for this 
purpose. The monthly time series showed similar variations and fluctuated of AST, minimum 
(decreases, January) and maximum (increases, July) in trend, with standard deviation (294.15 + 
14.02 Kº). Most stations, appeared positive trends in their annual AST series, only at Sfax 
negative, with higher trends for central stations than those closer to the desert and coast. The 
trends were lowest over coastal area. The Comparisons among selected six stations (Tunis, 
Tabarka, Thala, Sfax, Medenine, and EL-Borma) between the AST observed by AIRS and in-
situ data showed close agreement range from 0.38 to 3.6 Kº, and approximately the same in the 
north-to-south transect throughout the year. The validation results plainly evident a high 
correlation coefficient (R, 0.995, 0.997, 0.994, 0.94, 0.974 and 0.95), and the asset values of

147,IOP Conference Series: Earth and,"Abstract. Currently, remote sensing has been used extensively in the agriculture industry for 
oil palm monitoring due to their large plantation area. Oil palm monitoring can be done by 
performing land cover classification using various classification methods and machine learning 
algorithms. This study was conducted to perform oil palm mapping using WorldView-2 satellite 
imagery and classify land cover features using machine learning algorithms such as Random 
Forest (RF) and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC). A total of 58609 sampling points 
were classified into six classes which are water, built-up, bare soil, forest, mature oil palm (≥9 
years) and young oil palm (3-8 years). The training and testing samples were split using 3-fold 
cross-validation. 67% of the total sampling points were used for training samples whereas the 
other 33% were used for testing samples. The methods used to validate the data in this study is 
by using spectral reflectance and Google Earth Pro. Accuracy assessment was conducted after 
obtaining the classification output such as Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa Accuracy (KA), 
Precision, Recall and F1-score. As a result, the oil palm mapping using RF has a higher accuracy 
than LSVC which is 72.49% for OA and 62.98% for KA. The p-value obtained from the 
McNemar’s test conducted in this study is 0.683 (>0.05) which concludes that the predictive 
performance of the two models are equal."

147,Analysis of soil electrical resistivity and hydraulic conductivity relationship for characterisation of lithology inducing slope instability in residual soil,"Abstract 
Slope instability occurrences as damaging shallow-landslides in the residual soil around 
mountains has been widely studied with geophysical, geotechnical and hydrogeo-
logical techniques but relating soil electrical resistivity to hydraulic conductivity for 
characterisation of lithology inducing of these landslides is not common. In this study, 
we used Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) data and Hydraulic Conductivity (HC) 
data obtained from soil samples collected within 1–4.5 m depth in the borehole to 
assess the characteristics of soil that can induce landslide in the study location. The HC 
data were derived empirically from Beyer, Kozeny-Carman and Slitcher formula which 
were validated with HC obtained from laboratory experiment. The Empirical Derived 
Hydraulic Conductivities (EDHC) were correlated with the soil resistivity. The result 
shows a strong correlation between soil resistivity and HC with regression values of 
­R2 = 0.9702, ­R2 = 0.9153 and ­R2 = 0.9232 for Beyer, Kozeny-Carman and Slitcher formula, 
respectively. The ERT model revealed a possible sliding surface between two contrast-
ing resistive top material and underneath conductive materials at about 4 m depth. 
The HC assessment result corroborated the ERT model result because high and low-HC 
values were obtained in the borehole soil samples within 0–4 m and > 4 m depths from 
EDHC, respectively. The low-HC zone below 4 m depth was responsible for the occur-
rences of the shallow-landslides in the study.
Key points 
•	 Relationship between soil electrical resistivity and hydraulic conductivity were 
examined for assessment of lithology inducing shallow-landslide.
•	 Soil electrical resistivity delineated a boundary between two contrasting resistive 
and conductive lithologies at 4 m depth.
•	 Strong correlation ranged between ­R2 = 0.9153 to 0.9702 were observed between 
soil resistivity and hydraulic conductivity for the soil samples examined.

147,Oil palm yield prediction across blocks from multi-source data using machine learning and deep learning,"Abstract
Crop yield estimates are affected by various factors including weather, nutrients and management practices. Predicting 
yields on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner by considering these factors is essential for preventing climate risk 
and ensuring food security, particularly in the light of climate change and the escalation of extreme climatic events. In this 
study, integrating multi-source data (i.e. satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs), satellite-derived climatic variables (i.e. 
land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall precipitation, weather station and field-surveys), we built one multiple linear 
regression (MLR), three machine learning (XGBoost, support vector regression, and random forest) and one deep learning 
(deep neural network) models to predict oil palm yield at block-level within the oil palm plantation. Moreover, time-series 
moving average and backward elimination feature selection technique were implemented at the pre-processing stage. The 
yield prediction models were developed and tested using MLR, XGBoost, support vector regression (SVR), random forest 
(RF) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Their model performances were then compared using evaluation metrics 
and generated the final spatial prediction map based on the best performance. DNN achieved the best model performances 
for both selected ­(R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 2.92 t ­ha− 1; MAE = 2.56 t ­ha− 1 and MAPE = 0.09 t ­ha− 1) and full predictors ­(R2 = 0.76; 
RMSE of 3.03 t ­ha− 1; MAE of 2.88 t ­ha− 1; MAPE of 0.10 t ­ha− 1). In addition, advanced ensemble machine learning (ML) 
techniques such as XGBoost may be utilised as a supplementary for oil palm yield prediction at the block level. Among 
them, MLR recorded the lowest performance. By using backward elimination to identify the most significant predictors, the 
performance of all models was improved by 5–26% for ­R2, and that decreased by 3–31% for RMSE, 7–34% for MAE, and 
1–15% for MAPE. After backward elimination, the DNN achieved the highest prediction accuracy among the other models, 
with a 14% increase in R-squared, a 11% decrease in RMSE, a 32% decrease in MAE and a 1% decrease in MAPE. Our study 
successfully developed efficient and accurate yield prediction models for timely predicting oil palm yield over a large area 
by integrating data from multiple sources. These would be useful for plantation management estimating oil palm yields to 
speed up the decision-making process for sustainable production."

147,Effects of Ambient Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Exposure on Calorie Intake and Appetite of Outdoor Workers,"Abstract: Malaysia has been experiencing smoke-haze episodes almost annually for the past few
decades. PM2.5 is the main component in haze and causes harmful impacts on health due to its small
aerodynamic size. This study aimed to explore the implications of PM2.5 exposure on the dietary
intake of working individuals. Two phased 13-weeks follow-up study was conducted involving
440 participants, consisting of two cohorts of outdoor and indoor workers. Ambient PM2.5 concen-
trations were monitored using DustTrakTM DRX Aerosol Monitor. Data on Simpliﬁed Nutritional
Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) and 24 h diet recall were collected weekly. The highest PM2.5 con-
centration of 122.90 ± 2.07 µg/m3 was recorded in August, and it vastly exceeded the standard value
stipulated by US EPA and WHO. SNAQ scores and calorie intake were found to be signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) associated with changes in PM2.5 exposure of outdoor workers. Several moderate and
positive correlations (R-value ranged from 0.4 to 0.6) were established between SNAQ scores, calorie
intake and PM2.5 exposure. Overall ﬁndings suggested that long hours of PM2.5 exposure affect
personal dietary intake, potentially increasing the risk of metabolic syndromes and other unde-
sired health conditions. The current policy should be strengthened to safeguard the well-being of
outdoor workers."
147,Hydrogeological Assessment of Hydraulic Conductivity on Gully Formation in Erosion Degraded Residual Soil of an Unstable Slope,"Abstract Urbanization around the world has led to
expansion and building of structures into slope areas that
are prone to slope instability caused by gully erosion
occasioned from soil piping due to poor drainage of rain-
water and low cohesion of friable soils, which needs to be

revealed that soil pipes were initiated at 0.1–0.45 m depth
and developed into gullies of [ 2 m which leads to slope
instability. Poorly graded soils with low EDHC values
within 0.5 m depth were responsible for the initiation of
soil pipes, growth and development into gullies during
heavy rainfall that cause substantial loss of soil and create
potential slope instability in the area. Assessed EDHC

points used as training samples and 20% applied as testing samples) were randomly selected in 
the study area which were then classified into six land cover features; water, bare soil, forest, 
immature oil palm (the age of 2-8 year), mature oil palm (age >8 year) and built-up area. These 
data were validated by using spectral reflectance, Google Earth Pro and ground checking. The 
accuracy assessment was conducted by a confusion matrix method. The results showed that 
classification of land features using DNN with batch size 32 and epoch 100 has the highest 
accuracy which is 99.35% for overall accuracy and 98.49% kappa accuracy. This study 
demonstrated various machine learning algorithms that may be used to detect and classify the 
maturity of oil palm trees, which is vital to record in tree inventories for effective plantation 
management."

An integrated GIS, Remote sensing, and Geophysical techniques have been successfully applied to 
generate the previously non-available groundwater prospectivity map for the present study area. 
Selected thematic maps were integrated using the weighted sum tool of the spatial analyst tool of 
the ArcGIS software. The five thematic maps used are: lithology map, drainage density map, slope 
map, lineaments density map, and the topographic map of the area. The groundwater prospectivity 
map generated was reclassified into low, moderate, high, and very high potential zones on the 
basis of their assigned layer rank, which also depends on their degree of influence on groundwater 
occurrence. Areas around Gombe, Wuyo, Deba, Alkaleri, Kaltungo, Misau, Nafada, Bajoga towns 
are the regions that showed very high prospects for groundwater occurrence. Data processing 
filters such as: horizontal derivatives, Analytic signal processing, 3D-Euler depth estimation was 
applied on the magnetic data in order to map structures and lithologic contacts before its 
subsequent integration with other structural lineaments as a thematic layer. Vertical Electrical 
Sounding (VES) data were used to compute hydraulic conductivity, and Transmisivity etc. for the 
acquiferous layers identified. The results of the present study showed some regions that are 
classified as highly prospective to be consistent with high transmisivity and high yield values. The 
final outcome (groundwater potential map) of this research demonstrated that GIS/remote sensing, 
and the geophysical technique employed is a very powerful tool for generating groundwater 
prospectivity map, which is very vital in terms of planning for groundwater exploration and 
exploitation."

locations within the Earth’s crust display some manifestations of sub-surface geothermal occurrences,
such as hot springs, a volcanic plug, mud volcanoes, and hydrothermal alterations, that need to be
investigated further. The present area of investigations also reveals some of these manifestations.
However, no attempt was made to examine the prospectivity of this terrain using the efﬁcient GIS-

The integration of remote sensing, Geographic information system (GIS), and other geophysical
methods (Magnetic and gravity) was performed to map the promising geothermal areas. Multiple
input data sets such as aero-magnetic, aero-gravity, aero-radiometric, digital elevation model (DEM),
geological map, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were selected, processed, and
use to generate ﬁve thematic layers, which include heat ﬂow, temperature gradients, integrated
lineaments, residual gravity, and lithology maps. The ﬁve thematic layers were standardized and
synthesized into a geothermal prospectivity map. The respective ranks and weight of the thematic
layers and their classes were assigned based on expert opinion and knowledge of the local geology.

in the coastal areas. Although previous studies have shown that it is vulnerable to rising sea levels,
the combination of sea-level rise and local land subsidence would be devastating. Therefore, the
objective of this study is to apply the local land subsidence model to estimate the inundated areas
which relate to sea level rise by 2100. Land subsidence is quantiﬁed by the SBAS-InSAR technique
on the basis of Sentinel-1 radar images for both ascending and descending tracks. For the ﬁrst time,
the geostatistical analyst method is used to merge the different track results and create the land
subsidence models, the results show this method can maximize land deformation ﬁelds and minimize
deformation errors. According to the land deformation results, all of the coastlines in the east of the
island have differing medium levels of subsidence, especially in reclaimed lands and building areas.
Lastly, the bathtub model is used to quantify the inundated areas by combing regional sea-level rise
projection and local land subsidence models under CoastalDEM in 2100 projections. The results of
this study indicate land subsidence that would increase 2.0% and 5.9% of the inundated area based
on the different scenarios by 2100 projections."

149,An Efficient RFF Extraction Method Using Asymmetric Masked Auto-Encoder,"Abstract—Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) has been
widely used in wireless transceivers as an additional physical
security layer. Most of the existing RFF extraction methods
rely on a large number of labeled signal samples for model
training. However, in real communication environments, it is
usually necessary to process timely received signal samples,
which are limited in quantity and are difficult to obtain labels,
the performance of most RFF methods is generally poor. To ef-
fectively extract features from the limited and unlabeled signal
samples, we propose an efficient RFF extraction method using
an asymmetric masked auto-encoder (AMAE). Specifically, we
design an asymmetric extractor-decoder, where the extractor
is used to learn the latent representation of the masked signals
and the decoder as light as a convolution layer reconstructs
the unmasked signal from the latent representation. Using
commercial off-the-shelf LoRa datasets and WiFi datasets, we
show that the proposed AMAE-based RFF extraction method
achieves the best performance compared with four advanced
unsupervised methods whether in the case of large data size
or small data size, or under line of sight (LOS) and non line of
sight (NLOS) channel scenarios. The codes of this paper can

Noise Ratios (SNR). To surmount these challenges, we propose
a novel open-set SEI (OS-SEI) strategy that utilizes a Metric-

149,Variable-Channel Specific Emitter Identification Method Using Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation,"Abstract— Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a technique
that identifies radio equipment by analyzing and comparing
the characteristics of radio frequency signals. Deep learning
(DL), which fully exploits the hidden features of data and
automatically makes classification decisions, has shown good
performance in SEI. However, the success of DL is based
on the training of abundant labeled samples, but collecting
and annotating such data is challenging. In addition, the
received data contains not only device-relevant features, but also
device-irrelevant features, models trained under fixed channels
often lack channel robustness. Considering these problems,
we propose a semantic consistency-powered semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) method for variable-channel SEI (VC-
SEI). Specifically, we innovatively start from the perspective of
semantic consistency, introduce domain adversarial training to
constrain global semantic consistency (GSC) to extract channel-
irrelevant features, and design two loss functions to constrain
local semantic consistency (LSC) to extract category-relevant
features, so as to jointly realize domain adaptation. The proposed
SSDA-based VC-SEI method is evaluated on a dataset from 16
USRP X310 Radios, our method obtains 84.20% identification
accuracy on the target domain and 92.00% identification
accuracy on the source domain when only 1% of training samples
in the target domain are labeled, which is much higher than
other methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed SSDA-
based VC-SEI method achieve better variable-channel emitter
identification performance than other methods. Our code can be

149,Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification Based on Length-Robust Representation and Incremental Learning,"Abstract—Radio frequency fingerprinting identification (RFFI)
is a technology that uses signal processing techniques to extract
the characteristics of collected wireless signals to enable the
individual identification of devices. Over the past few years,
deep learning (DL) has made great achievements in the field
of signal identification, and the research on the RFFI methods
has made great progress. To address the issue of fixed-size input
data required by many neural networks, such as convolutional
neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), this
paper proposes a transformation method that converts variable-
length signals into contour stella constellation (CSC). In addition,
in the most DL-based the RFFI methods, a global analysis of
the entire radio frequency signal is required, which demands a
large amount of calculation and is easily affected by changes
in the propagation environment. We propose an incremental
learning (IL)-based the RFFI approach, which enables dynamic
updating of the model and improves its identification and
generalization capabilities. Experimental results show that our
proposed method shows excellent performance in processing data
streams in real time and the identification accuracy finally can
reach 89.14%. The codes of this paper can be downloaded from

149,Resource-Constrained Specific Emitter Identification Using End-to-End Sparse Feature Selection,"Abstract—Specific emitter identification (SEI) refers to a
process to determine the category of emitters by extracting,
analyzing and matching the characteristics of received emitter
signals. With the increasingly complex environment, traditional
SEI methods, such as parameter matching, become difficult
to meet the needs of robust and effective signal identification.
Deep learning (DL) possesses powerful feature extraction ability
and has been widely used in SEI. The superior performance
of DL-based SEI methods also brings problems of redundant
model parameters and high feature dimensionality, which further
causes slow convergence rate, high storage requirements, and
ever-increasing computational complexity. In this paper, we
propose an SEI method based on end-to-end sparse feature
selection (SFS) to make model pay more attention to features
with good identification performance. Specifically, we add sparse
parameters to features and design loss function composed of
cross-entropy loss and sparse regularization. Several experiments
are conducted on ADS-B, WiFi and LoRa datasets. From the
simulation results, our proposed SFS-SEI method improves
feature sparsity, speeds up loss convergence, reduces model

149,Intelligent Specific Emitter Identification Using Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network,"Abstract—Speciﬁc emitter identiﬁcation (SEI) is a promising
technology for the authentication of internet of things (IoT)
devices. With the rapid increase in the number and types of
emitter signals and the growing complexity of the electromagnetic
environment, traditional emitter identiﬁcation methods face
issues like declining identiﬁcation performance. Furthermore,
convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot fully exploit the
coupling information between the in-phase and quadrature
components of complex baseband signals. In contrast, complex-
valued convolutional neural network (CVCNN) can better
utilize the correlation between the phase and amplitude of
complex signals. To address these issues, this paper introduces
CVCNN to carry out SEI task. CVCNN is trained to learn
effective features of emitter signals, improving identiﬁcation
performance. The method is evaluated on two datasets, automatic
dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and global system for
mobile communications (GSM), comparing the performance of
different neural network in identifying these emitter signals.
The results demonstrate that the CVCNN method achieves
higher identiﬁcation accuracy. Our code can be downloaded from

149,Robust Specific Emitter Identification With Sample Selection and Regularization Under Label Noise,"Abstract—Deep learning (DL), renowned for its superior
feature extraction capabilities, has remarkably succeeded in
Specific emitter identification (SEI), especially when supported
by high-quality labeled data. However, obtaining accurate signal
labels in complex electromagnetic environments is challenging,
and manual labeling is prone to errors, underscoring the
need for robust DL-based SEI methods that can handle label
noise. These methods prevent neural networks from overfitting
noisy labels, thereby boosting identification performance. Yet,
research in this area is still limited. Our study introduces
a robust label-noise SEI approach and the sample selection
and regularization (SSR) method. This involves a two-stage
adaptive sample selection (ASS) driven by confidence learning.
The first stage entails coarse-grained separation of true and
false labels through direct deep neural network (DNN) training.
In the second stage, semi-supervised learning (SSL) utilizes
a regularization-inspired loss, incorporating label smoothing
regularization (LSR) and entropy minimization (EM), for fine-
grained sample selection. The DNN is ultimately trained on
precisely selected true-labeled samples. Comparative experiments
on automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and
Wi-Fi datasets demonstrate that our SSR method outperforms
existing methods in identification accuracy, particularly at a 20%
label-noise ratio, achieving 86.00% accuracy with the ADS-B
dataset and 99.38% with the Wi-Fi dataset. The code is available
at: https://github.com/sleepeach/SSR-SEI.

149,Enhanced Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification via Phase Shift Prediction and Decoupling,"Abstract—Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is gaining
prominence as a passive authentication technology for the
physical layer of secure six-generation (6G) wireless commu-
nications. Leveraging Deep Learning (DL) for its robust data
analysis and feature extraction capabilities, SEI effectively
extracts Radio Frequency Fingerprints (RFFs) from received

for
identification.
However,
DL-based
SEI

a
significant challenge due to the limited availability of labeled

Decoupling (PSPD). We design a pretext task that allows
an
encoder
to
learn
feature
representations
that
include
both phase shift relevant and irrelevant components from an
unlabeled auxiliary dataset, processed by Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT). In the subsequent task, we fine-tune the
pretrained encoder with a classifier using a target dataset

that when the number of samples per category is 10 or
more, the accuracy of our proposed SEI method exceeds

149,Overcoming Data Limitations: A Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification Method Using Self-Supervised Learning and Adversarial Augmentation,"Abstract— Specific emitter identification (SEI) based on radio
frequency fingerprinting (RFF) is a physical layer authentication
method in the field of wireless network security. RFFs are unique
features embedded in the electromagnetic waves, which come
from the hard imperfections in the wireless devices. Deep learning
has been applied to many SEI tasks due to its powerful feature
extraction capabilities. However, the success of most methods
hinges on massive and labeled samples, and few methods focus
on a realistic scenario, where few samples are available and
labeled. In this paper, to overcome data limitations, we propose a
few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) method based on self-supervised learning
and adversarial augmentation (SA2SEI). Specifically, to overcome
the limitation of label dependence for auxiliary dataset, a nov-
elty adversarial augmentation (Adv-Aug)-powered self-supervised
learning is designed to pre-train a RFF extractor using unlabeled
auxiliary dataset. Subsequently, to overcome the limitation of
sample dependence, knowledge transfer is introduced to fine-tune
the extractor and a classifier with target dataset including few
samples (5-30 samples per emitter in this paper) and corre-
sponding labels. In addition, auxiliary dataset and target dataset
are come from different emitters. An open-source large-scale
real-world automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B)
dataset and a Wi-Fi dataset are used to evaluate the proposed
SA2SEI method. The simulation results show that the proposed
method can extract more discriminative RFF features and obtain
higher identification performance in the FS-SEI. Specifically,
when there are only 5 samples per Wi-Fi device, it can achieve
83.40% identification accuracy, in which 38.63% identification
accuracy improvement comes from the Adv-Aug of pre-training

sidered as a passive physical layer authentication technology
for future secure six-generation (6G) wireless communications.
Traditionally, Deep Learning (DL) is used for extracting deep
features from Radio Frequency (RF) for identification. However,
this method often encounters the challenge of limited training
samples. To address this problem, we propose a Few-Shot SEI
(FS-SEI) method using Rotation Feature Decoupling (RFD).
Specifically, we construct a pretext task that enables an encoder
to learn a split feature representation containing a rotation-
relevant part and a rotation-irrelevant part from an unlabeled
auxiliary dataset. In the downstream task, we fine-tune the
pretrained encoder on target dataset consisting of few-shot

149,Rogue Emitter Detection Using Hybrid Network of Denoising Autoencoder and Deep Metric Learning,"Abstract—Rogue emitter detection (RED) is a crucial technique
to maintain secure internet of things applications. Existing
deep learning-based RED methods have been proposed under
friendly environments. However, these methods perform unstably
under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To address this
problem, we propose a robust RED method, which is a hybrid
network of denoising autoencoder and deep metric learning
(DML). Speciﬁcally, denoising autoencoder is adopted to mitigate
noise interference and then improve its robustness under low
SNR while DML plays an important role to improve the feature
discrimination. Several typical experiments are conducted to
evaluate the proposed RED method on an automatic dependent
surveillance-Broadcast dataset and an IEEE 802.11 dataset and
also to compare it with existing RED methods. Simulation results
show that the proposed method achieves better RED performance
and higher noise robustness with more discriminative semantic
vectors than existing methods."
149,Interpolative Metric Learning for Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification,"Abstract—Speciﬁc emitter identiﬁcation (SEI) is a potential physical
layer authentication technology, which is one of the most critical comple-
ments of upper layer authentication. Radio frequency ﬁngerprint (RFF)-
based SEI is to distinguish one emitter from each other by immutable RF
characteristics from electronic components. Due to the powerful ability of
deep learning (DL) to extract hidden features and perform classiﬁcation,
it can extract highly separative features from massive signal samples, thus
enabling SEI. Considering the condition of limited training samples, we
propose a novel few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) method based on interpolative
metric learning (InterML) which gets rid of the dependence on auxiliary
dataset. Speciﬁcally, InterML is designed to mine more implicit samples
in the sample space to improve generalization, and constrain the feature
distance in the feature space to improve discriminability. The proposed
InterML-based FS-SEI method is evaluated on a real-world Wi-Fi dataset.
The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better
identiﬁcation performance, higher feature discriminability and more stable
performance than ﬁve latest FS-SEI methods. In the 10 shot scenario, the
identiﬁcation accuracy of InterML is 9"
149,Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification Using Asymmetric Masked Auto-Encoder,"Abstract— Specific emitter identification (SEI) based on radio
frequency fingerprint (RFF) characteristics can be used to
identify different transmitters, and the deep learning (DL)-based
SEI methods have achieved good performance with sufficient
samples. However, these methods are difficult to identify emitters
when the labeled training samples are limited. Hence, we propose
a few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) using asymmetric masked auto-encoder
(AMAE) to solve the few-shot problem. Specifically, we use the
sufficiently unlabeled training samples which refer as the source
domain to drive the training process of AMAE to obtain an RFF
extractor with good feature extraction performance on the source
domain, and then the pre-trained RFF extractor together with
a classifier is fine-tuned using limited labeled training samples
which refer as the target domain. Simulation results show that
the proposed AMAE-based FS-SEI method achieves state-of-the-
art identification performance compared to other supervised and
unsupervised methods on the LoRa dataset with 30 categories and
WiFi dataset with 16 categories. The codes can be downloaded

Security, which detects the individual emitter according to its

sufﬁcient training samples and the integrity of samples’ labels.
The extensive deployment of wireless devices generates a huge
amount of signals, but signals labeling is quite difﬁcult and
expensive with the high demand for expertise. In this article, we
present an SEI method based on dual consistency regularization
(DCR), which enables feature extraction and identiﬁcation using
a few labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples.
With the help of pseudo labeling, we leverage consistency
between the predicted class distribution of weakly augmented
unlabeled training samples and that of strongly augmented train-
ing unlabeled samples, and consistency between semantic feature
distribution of labeled samples and that of pseudo-labeled sam-
ples, which takes the unlabeled samples into account to model
parameter tuning for a more accurate emitter identiﬁcation.
Extensive numerical results demonstrate that compared with
well-known semi-supervised learning-based SEI methods, our
method obtains 99.77% identiﬁcation accuracy on a WiFi data
set and 90.10% identiﬁcation accuracy on an automatic depen-
dent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data set when only 10%
of training samples are labeled, and improves the identiﬁcation

149,Semi-Supervised Specific Emitter Identification Method Using Metric-Adversarial Training,"Abstract—Speciﬁc emitter identiﬁcation (SEI) plays an increas-
ingly crucial and potential role in both military and civilian
scenarios. It refers to a process to discriminate individual emit-
ters from each other by analyzing extracted characteristics
from given radio signals. Deep learning (DL) and deep neu-
ral networks (DNNs) can learn the hidden features of data and
build the classiﬁer automatically for decision making, which
have been widely used in the SEI research. Considering the
insufﬁciently labeled training samples and large-unlabeled train-
ing samples, the semi-supervised learning-based SEI (SS-SEI)
methods have been proposed. However, there are few SS-SEI
methods focusing on extracting the discriminative and gener-
alized semantic features of radio signals. In this article, we
propose an SS-SEI method using metric-adversarial training
(MAT). Speciﬁcally, pseudo labels are innovatively introduced
into metric learning to enable semi-supervised metric learning
(SSML), and an objective function alternatively regularized by
SSML and virtual adversarial training (VAT) is designed to
extract discriminative and generalized semantic features of radio

149,A Robust Few-Shot SEI Method Using Class-Reconstruction and Adversarial Training,"Abstract—Speciﬁc emitter identiﬁcation (SEI) is a promising
physical layer authentication technique based on unintentionally
hardware impairments of transmitters. These impairments are
independent of the data’s content, so they are difﬁcult to
forge and analyze. Recently, most deep learning (DL) based
SEI methods have been proposed, and have shown their
great performance. However, these methods are big data-
driven which means they have poor performance with limited
training samples, and the vulnerability of neural networks to
adversarial attacks is also a problem worth considering. In this
paper, we propose an innovative few-shot SEI method based
on class-reconstruction classiﬁcation network and adversarial
training (CRCN-AT) without the support of auxiliary dataset.
Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better
identiﬁcation performance and robustness in few-shot scenarios
compared to traditional methods. The Pytorch code is released

149,Automatic Modulation Classification Based on Decentralized Learning and Model Averaging,"Abstract—Automatic modulation classiﬁcation (AMC) is a
promising technology to identify the modulation mode of the
received signal in non-cooperative communication scenarios.
Recently, beneﬁtting from the outstanding classiﬁcation perfor-
mance of deep learning (DL), various deep neural networks
(DNNs) have been introduced into AMC methods. Most current
AMC methods are based on local framework (LocalAMC) where
there is only one device, or centralized framework (CentAMC)
where multiple local devices (LDs) upload their data to the only
one central server (CS). LocalAMC may not get ideal results due
to insufﬁcient data and ﬁnite computational power. CentAMC
carries a signiﬁcant risk of privacy leakage and the ﬁnal data
for training model in CS is quite massive. In this paper, we
propose an AMC method based on decentralized learning with
residual network (ResNet). Simulation results show that ResNet-
based decentralized AMC (DecentAMC) method achieves similar
classiﬁcation performance to CentAMC while improving training
efﬁciency and protecting data privacy."
149,Few-Shot Domain Adaption-Based Specific Emitter Identification Under Varying Modulation,"Abstract—Specific emitter identification (SEI) is an effective
Internet of things (IoT) data flow protection technique of
identifying individual emitters via unique characteristics of
different emitters. However, deep learning-based methods are
difficult to deal with the identification of emitters of variable
modulation signals, especially when there are only few samples
in the target domain. In order to solve the problem of small-
sample variable modulation classification, this paper designs a
SEI method based on transfer learning (TL), which freezes
some layers on the basis of the CVNN network trained in
the source domain, generalizes the transferable general features
learned into the new modulation signal recognition task, and
uses the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric as the
regularization of supervised learning to reduce the distribution
difference between the source domain and the target domain in
the latent space. Experimental results show that the proposed
method has a great improvement in recognition performance
compared with the method of separate training and direct
transfer of the target domain. Even with very few samples, there
is a certain performance guarantee."
149,Decentralized Automatic Modulation Classification Method Based on Lightweight Neural Network,"Abstract-Due to the computing capability and memory
limitations, it is difficult to apply the traditional deep learning
(DL) models to the edge devices (EDs) for realizing automatic
modulation classification (AMC). In this paper, a lightweight
neural
network
for
decentralized
learning-based
automatic
modulation classification (DecentAMC) method is proposed.
Specifically, group convolutional neural network (GCNN) is
designed by replacing the standard convolution layer with the
group convolution layer, replacing the flatten layer with the
global average pooling (GAP) layer and removing part of
fully connected layers. DecentAMC method is achieved by the
cooperation in which multiple EDs update and upload the model
weight to a central device (CD) for model aggregation to avoid
the data privacy disclosure. Experimental results show that
the proposed GCNN-based DecentAMC method can improve
training efficiency to about 4 times and 57 times than that
of GCNN-based centralized AMC (CentAMC) and CNN-based
DecentAMC respectively. GCNN-based DecentAMC method can
effectively reduce the communication cost and save storage of
EDs when compared with CNN-based DecentAMC. Meanwhile,
the time complexity and the space complexity of GCNN is
significantly decreased when compared with CNN and SCNN,
which is suitable to be deployed in EDs."

Due to the strong capability of deep learning (DL) in extracting
the hidden features of data and making classiﬁcation decision,

Considering the insufﬁciently labeled training dataset and large

entropy (CE) loss combined with deep metric learning (DML)
and CE loss combined with virtual adversarial training (VAT))
and an alternating optimization way are designed to extract
discriminative and generalized semantic features of radio signals.
The proposed MAT-based SS-SEI method is evaluated on an open

characteristics of a slot antenna by using an electric meta-
surface as a high refractive index superstrate has been pre-
sented. The gain enhancement mechanism described here
uses the phenomena of enhanced space ﬁeld by increasing
the effective aperture of the antenna, resulting from increase
in effective refractive index of the metasurface. As a fun-
damental constituent of the superstrate, a unit cell of the
metasurface composed of symmetrically placed triple pairs
of split-ring resonators is introduced. The unit cell of such
metasurface has been conﬁgured to realize a high refractive
index by using the principle of nearest-neighbor coupling.
An equivalent circuit model is developed to understand the
inﬂuence of coupling on the effective refractive index of the
metasurface. The presence of the metasurface as a super-
strate enhances the broadside gain of the slot by 8.71 dB and
the efﬁciency by 20.35 %. The total height of the proposed

rasorber operation, a wide transmission bandwidth in between the
absorption band from 9 to 11 GHz is obtained. The system is also
simpliﬁed with the help of an equivalent circuit model. The struc-
ture is carefully designed so that it is immuned to polarization and
angle sensitivity. Finally, the prototype is fabricated and measured,
and the results are found to be in good agreement with the simulated

150,Design of a compact triple-band metamaterial absorber with wide angle of incidence using connected resonator topology,"Abstract− A compact triple band metamaterial absorber is 
presented in this paper. The triple band absorbance is 
achieved by combining a meander line loaded rectangular 
close ring resonator with an electric field driven LC resonator 
within a single unit cell. A more compact unit cell having a size 
reduction of 14.47% and triple band absorption has been 
realized as an advantage over close ring metamaterial 
absorber. The artificially engineered structure has triple band 
absorbance with one band laying in C-band and another two 
in Ku and K band respectively. This triple band design can be 
used for stealth technology such as the C-band airborne radar 
and battlefield applications.   Moreover, the absorber can 
perform well over a wide angle of incidence."
150,A Miniaturized Ring Slot Antenna Design With Enhanced Radiation Characteristics,"Abstract—The design of a miniaturized CPW-fed ring slot antenna
using interdigitated slits is presented. The fundamental resonant frequency
of the ring slot antenna was reduced signiﬁcantly using an interdigitated
slit-loaded structure. A further reduction in resonant frequency to 54.46%
of the unloaded resonant frequency of the ring slot antenna was also
achieved using multiple interdigitated slits inside the ring, causing the
antenna to almost reach the electrically small limit. Thereafter, the antenna
characteristics of the electrically small antenna is signiﬁcantly enhanced
using a low impedance metamaterial slab design working under nor-
mal incidence, leading to a considerable reduction in superstrate height.
Particularly, the directivity and efﬁciency of the electrically small antenna
is signiﬁcantly improved with the incorporation of the low-proﬁle super-
strate. In addition, good matching characteristics are obtained for the
miniaturized antenna without the necessity of a matching network together
with improved bandwidth."
150,Journal of Physics D: Applied,"Abstract
Metal assisted photochemical etching (MAPCE) of 4H–silicon carbide (SiC) in Na2S2O8/
HF and H2O2/HF aqueous solutions is investigated with platinum as metallic cathode. The 
formation process of the resulting porous layer is studied with respect to etching time, 
concentration and type of oxidizing agent. From the experiments it is concluded that the 
porous layer formation is due to electron hole pairs generated in the semiconductor, which 
stem from UV light irradiation. The generated holes are consumed during the oxidation of 
4H–SiC and the formed oxide is dissolved by HF. To maintain charge balance, the oxidizing 
agent has to take up electrons at the Pt/etching solution interface.
Total dissolution of the porous layers is achieved when the oxidizing agent concentration 
decreases during MAPCE. In combination with standard photolithography, the definition 
of porous regions is possible. Furthermore chemical micromachining of 4 H–SiC at room 
temperature is possible."
150,A Low-Profile Multifunctional Metasurface Reflector for Multiband Polarization Transformation,"Abstract—This brief proposes a low-proﬁle multifunctional
metasurface reﬂector for simultaneous linear to linear (LP-to-
LP) and linear to circular (LP-to-CP) polarization conversion
over multiple bands. The metasurface unit cell comprises a split
ring resonator-loaded cross-diagonal pattern printed at the top
of a dielectric substrate and a thin air space that separates the
metallic bottom plate. The proposed reﬂector exhibits tri-band
LP-to-LP conversion at 5.47-5.68, 7.86-8.84, 14.68-16.83 GHz,
and quad-band LP-to-CP conversion at 5.30-5.41, 5.77-7.58, 9.27-
13.91, 17.53-19.59 GHz frequency range. The response of the
surface is analyzed through an equivalent circuit model (ECM),
which gives physical insight into the metasurface. Moreover, the
metasurface is explored through the characteristics mode (CM),
where signiﬁcant modes are determined based on the modal
behaviors. Thereafter, modal behaviors are further investigated
for simultaneous linear and circular polarization. Furthermore,
the proposed structure and its mirror symmetric conﬁguration
are employed to develop the checkerboard surface. Such surface
essentially realizes the phase gradient mechanism, which results
in radar cross-section (RCS) reduction in the frequency range of
5.85-5.95, 9.2-10.3, and 16.6-18.5 GHz. The measured results are
in good agreement with the simulated response."
150,A compact metamaterial with multi-band negative-index characteristics,"Abstract
In this article, a compact multi-band negative-
index metamaterial (NIM) operating under along the plane
incidence has been introduced. Compared to other multi-
band NIM based on stacked cell-based approach, the pro-
posed design does not require unit cells of different
dimensions to be placed adjacent to each other for real-
ization of a multi-band negative-index of refraction. As a
result, the proposed NIM is less inﬂuenced by the problem
of higher-order Bloch modes. Moreover, the reported NIM
is free from anomalies of cross-cell interconnection, which
is a typical problem associated with multi-band NIM based
on split-ring resonator–wire topology. The proposed NIM
has been realized by imprinting a resonantly coupled pair
of electric-LC resonators and a hybrid-shaped loop res-
onator on the opposite sides of a dielectric substrate. The
multi-band negative-index of refraction has been conﬁrmed
by both simulation and measurement. The investigated
structure indicates three bands of negative refractive index

This 
paper 
presents 
a 
multifunctional 
reconfigurable frequency selective surface (MRFSS) that can

on both the top and bottom sides to achieve the desired switching 
and tuning characteristics. By articulately controlling the bias 
conditions of the p-i-n diodes, the novel MRFSS structure can 
exhibit multiple functions under different working states, 
whereas the frequency tunability is attained in each state by 
adjusting the reverse bias voltage of the varactor diode. Under 
the OFF (top side)-OFF (bottom side) state of the p-i-n diodes, 
the MRFSS exhibits a bandpass transmission response tuning

151,Angularly Stable High-Q Factor Metamaterial Absorber for Biomedical Sensing Applications,"Abstract—In this letter, a thin, high Q-factor, angularly stable, and polarization-insensitive metamaterial absorber (MMA)
for sensing applications is presented. The absorber operates at the C-band, having near-unity absorptivity. The symmetric
design is polarization-insensitive under normal incidence. In addition, the novel design shows more than 90% absorptivity,
up to 80° incident angle, for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized waves under oblique incidence.
The absorption mechanism is described with the help of surface current distribution, induced electric ﬁeld, and parametric
analysis. To verify the resonance characteristic of the structure, an equivalent circuit analysis has been presented. A
precise shift in the absorption frequency is observed in response to alteration in the permittivity value of a material placed
above the geometry; hence, the proposed structure can be used as a refractive index sensor. Multiple characteristics,
such as thin proﬁle, high angular stability, polarization insensitiveness, and high Q factor, make the proposed MMA highly
desirable in refractive index sensing for biomedical applications."
151,"A wideband reconfigurable frequency selective surface switching among transmission, absorption, reflection, and rasorber operations","Abstract 
 
A reconfigurable frequency selective surface (RFSS) 
exhibiting wideband electromagnetic (EM) characteristics 
using p-i-n diodes and resistors has been presented in this 
paper. The unit cell design comprises a two-layered 
structure with metallic patterns engraved on both sides of 
each substrate layer, which are separated by an air spacer. 
Diodes are carefully mounted on the top side of layer 1 and 
bottom side of layer 2, supported with bias circuits. With 
precise control in the bias voltage across the diodes, four 
different EM operations, such as transmission, reflection, 
absorption, and rasorber are realized exhibiting wideband 
characteristics. The simulated results illustrate that during 
the OFF (p-i-n diode on layer-1)-OFF (p-i-n diode on layer-
2) case, the RFSS behaves as a rasorber with an insertion 
loss of 2.1 dB at 2.69 GHz (in the transmission window) 
and a wideband absorption of more than 80% absorptivity 
from 4.76-6.34 GHz (in the absorption window). The OFF-
ON state presents a wideband absorption with an 
absorptivity greater than 80% in the frequency range of 
3.25-6.05 GHz. The ON-OFF state exhibits a wideband 
transmission characteristic with an insertion loss of less 
than 2 dB ranging from 2.41-4.49 GHz. The final ON-ON 
state represents the reflection behavior with a reflection 
amplitude lower than -2.8 dB for the entire frequency 
range. Thus, the proposed RFSS structure exhibits multiple 
wideband characteristics, thus showing huge prospects for 
various defense and civil applications."

technique to design and demonstrate a frequency selective surface 
(FSS) based bandstop filter on a sinusoidal surface. The novelty of 
the method lies in the uniform placement of the unit cells on 
different non-planar surfaces using a hybrid method comprising 
an analytical technique and full-wave simulation that significantly 
improves the shielding characteristic in a wideband spectrum 
(having a -10 dB stopband from 7 to 13 GHz with a fractional 
bandwidth of 60%). A conventional metallic square loop is 
considered as the constituent unit cell topology, which is 
intelligibly positioned over a large surface using the proposed 
method. The structure is then simulated using the finite element 
boundary integral, as well as fabricated exploiting the three-

direction-independent metamaterial (MM) electromagnetic
wave (EM) absorber for K-band frequency application is
investigated and validated experimentally. The unit cell of
the metamaterial absorber consists of four 90° rotated
L-shaped
metallic
patches
imprinted
on
a
dielectric
substrate backed by a metallic sheet. The structure yield
absorption in the broad frequency ranges from 22.5 to
29.3 GHz for both TE and TM polarized waves with more than
90 % absorptivity having a wide fractional bandwidth of
(6.8 GHz) 25.8 %. The structure is four-fold symmetric and
hence yields polarization insensitivity for diﬀerent angles
of polarization under both TE and TM polarized waves.
The structure is also investigated under oblique incidence
where the 80 % absorptivity holds up to 45° incident angles
for both TE and TM waves. The absorption mechanism is
explained with the help of top and bottom surface current
distribution, induced electric ﬁeld, and parametric analysis.
To verify the resonance in the structure, characteristic
mode, and equivalent circuit analysis have been carried
out and presented. A prototype of the absorber has been
fabricated
and
simulated

are
validated
with
measured results. Measured results are showing good
agreement with the simulated responses. The novelty of the
proposed absorber lies in its unique metallic pattern on a
λ0/8 (concerning the canter frequency of absorption
bandwidth) thin FR-4 substrate while showing the wide ab-
sorption bandwidth and direction independence to normal
and oblique incidence. The compact nature of the absorber
and broadband response with good polarization insensi-
tivity at normal and oblique incidence makes it commer-
cially suitable for the reduction of radar cross section (RCS)
in stealth applications at the K-band."

151,A Miniaturized Polarization-Insensitive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Beam Steering Applications,"Abstract—Reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have as-
sumed an important role in the development of the backbone
of new communication standards. Their ability to dynamically
cause a change in the propagation characteristics of the incoming
signal, coupled with their small size and inexpensive nature, has
led to their accelerated adoption across the new-age network
infrastructure for purposes such as establishing a secure link
between the source and the receiver, dynamic switching to the
least path-loss transmission path, and so on. The key concerns
in designing an RIS that caters to the different applications are
polarization-insensitivity and angular stability with respect to the
transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized
signals. In this work, a miniaturized RIS design is presented for
phase switching which is not only polarization-insensitive, but
also achieves angular stability for both TE and TM polarized
signals. A wide phase switching is obtained (-160° to +160°) by
using varactor diodes, as well as high angular stability is achieved
up to 50° with an operating frequency centered at 3.5 GHz. The
full wave simulation results are presented and corroborated with

waveguide (SIW) based MIMO antenna array operating at 28 
GHz, intended for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) wireless 
applications. The design entails a hexagonal slot etched into the 
upper layer of the SIW cavity. Through meticulous optimization 
of different parameters (the slot’s dimensions and its placement 
within the SIW cavity), a broadside radiation pattern is resulted 
featuring an impedance bandwidth of 370 MHz (from 27.82 
GHz to 28.19 GHz) centered around 28 GHz and a peak gain of 
6.10 dBi. To further improve the antenna’s performance, a 1×2

This array geometry yields a maximum gain of 8.28 dBi and an 
impedance bandwidth spanning 0.87 GHz (from 27.59 GHz to 
28.46 GHz). To further enhance channel capacity, a 1×4 MIMO 
array is formulated by extending the antenna array. Thus the 
proposed structure encompasses several notable attributes 
including large operating gain, and good channel capacity, along 
with commendable efficiency, and minimal cross-polarization, 
thereby rendering it well-suited for mm-wave applications."

dielectric substrate, where metallic patterns and electronic components are articulately used to exhibit both
types of CR techniques (interweave and underlay) through three different working states. In the first state,
the antenna radiates over a wide bandwidth from 2.26 to 7.00 GHz for sensing applications, while in the
second mode, the geometry has a frequency tunability between 4.80 to 6.20 GHz to be used for interweave

very thin dielectric slab. The proposed phase shifter design is 
divided into three sections. An HMSIW with a series of 
rectangular grooves are etched on the top conducting layer to 
obtain the initial phase shift. Next, the IDC-based slots are 
engraved to further improve the phase shift. Lastly, the phase 
shift is obtained in wideband due to the extra loading of the 
dielectric slab patterned with rectangular strips that constitutes 
the final structure. The proposed three versions of the HMSIW 
phase shifter designs provide a phase shift of 15 degree, 70

rasorber (FSR) geometry with dual-transmission and dual-

resulting in multiple absorption regions surrounding the 
transmission peaks. The proposed FSR comprises of one 
absorptive layer and one transmissive layer, separated by an air 
spacer, and each of them is realized by patterning geometries in 
a periodic arrangement. The transmission bands are obtained at 
5.30 GHz and 8.10 GHz with insertion losses of 0.79 dB and 0.46 
dB, respectively. A wide absorption band, originally realized 
between 2.26 GHz and 8.79 GHz, gets divided into multiple 
absorption regions due to the presence of in-band transmission 
peaks and shows two discrete absorption bands from 2.01 GHz 
to 4.95 GHz and 5.81 GHz to 7.45 GHz. The structure achieves 
an overall fractional bandwidth of 118.20% with respect to its 
centre frequency. Polarization-insensitivity as well as angular 
stability for different polarizations (till 30 angle of incidence) are 
also observed in the structure. As compared to the existing dual-

boundary integral (FEBI) method, and the bandstop filter 
response is observed across the operating band (with

153,"Cadmium selenide is the material used in virtually all of the quantum dot biological labeling to date, and its emission spectrum conveniently spans the visible light range (~450–660 nm)","ABSTRACT 
Our research work has for objective the study of a sensor with planar resonator for applications 
in the non-destructive control. In this context, two approaches were defined. In a first part, a 
conception, a modeling, a simulation with commercial softwares (HFSS, CST), a realization and 
measurements were treated on Rectangular Patch Resonators (RPR). The proposed theoretical 
analysis is based on the Moment Method (MoM) via the Galerkin’s approach, in which three 
types of entire domain basis functions are used to expand the patch currents. While, the first two 
types of basis functions involve a set of sinusoidal cavity modes without edge conditions (sbf-
wo-ec) and with edge conditions (sbf-w-ec), and in order to incorporate the edge conditions (cp-
ec), the third one consists of Chebyshev polynomials combinations with weighting factors. These 
last ones as well as the Green Dyadic spectral functions are efficiently implanted with compact

proposed RPR prototypes. The exactness of the obtained results is estimated using four 
prototypes operating near 6 GHz, taking into account only the fundamental mode resonant

frequency. The theoretical model is compared with the simulations and the measurement results. 
The second approach of our work which is developed in this paper is focused on the 
characterization of biological materials in vitro using the RPR prototypes proposed as applicator 
in the non-destructive control and the medical domain to find the abnormalities of these tissues 
such as: eczema, psoriasis, cancer, etc. Our center of interest will be managed towards the 
dielectric properties of the biological material to extract the relative permittivity and the loss 
factor on several samples (liver, fat, chicken, butter, foie gras, etc.)."

This paper has for objective to explore the study of a sensor based on a rectangular planar resonator (RPR) 
for applications to Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE). In this context, conception, modeling, simulation 
and realization have been made on rectangular structures with an anisotropic substrate and an isotropic 
superstrate. The theoretical model is based on the moment method (MoM) via Galerkin’s approach, in which 
three types of basis and testing functions are used. These functions as well as the spectral dyadic Green func-
tion are efficiently implanted on compact structured Fortran 90 codes. The accuracy of the obtained results 
is assessed using four prototypes of RPRs operating around 6 GHz, taking only into account the Resonant 
Frequency (RF) of the fundamental dominant mode. The theoretical model is compared to simulation and 
measurements results and shown very good agreements. The RPR criteria are established theoretically and 
validated experimentally with two electromagnetic commercial softwares (HFSS and CST); to be used in 
future prospects as an electromagnetic (EM) sensor for the characterization of superstrates.

154,Multiple Output Sparse Gaussian Processes with Multiple Kernel Learning for Electric Load Forecasting,"Abstract—Electric load forecasting is one of the techniques
that support smart grid objectives. It refers to predicting the
electricity demand at aggregated levels which is mandatory for
the smart grid’s proper functioning and having a balance between
electricity generation and power consumption at all time. In this
paper, we proposed multiple output sparse Gaussian processes
with multiple kernel learning for hourly day-ahead short-term
electric load forecasting using load, dew point, and temperature
values. Mean absolute percentage error metric is used to evaluate
and compare the performance of the proposed multiple output
sparse Gaussian processes with multiple kernel learning and the
persistence method in three scenarios (using load and dew point
values, using load and temperature values, and finally, using
load, dew point, and temperature values from previous days).
The results showed that the proposed method achieved much
lower MAPE values than the persistence method."
154,Multiple Output Sparse Gaussian Processes for Short-Term Electric Load Forecasting,"Abstract—Smart grid is introduced to address power grid
challenges such as reliability, efficiency, greenhouse gas and
carbon emissions, economics, safety, and energy security. Electric
load forecasting is one of the techniques that support smart grid
objectives. It forecasts the electric load at aggregated levels and
is mandatory for the smart grid’s proper functioning. It keeps
a balance between load generation and load consumption and
can be classified as very short-term, short-term, medium-term,
and long-term electric load forecasting based on the time interval
of its prediction. In this paper, multiple output sparse Gaussian
processes are proposed to predict 24 values of the electric load for
the next day (short-term electric load forecasting) based on load
and weather data (temperature and dew point) from previous
days. The performance of the proposed multiple output sparse
Gaussian processes was compared with the persistence method.
By comparing the mean absolute percentage error values of the
proposed method with the persistence method, it can be seen that
the proposed method outperforms the persistence method very
well."
154,Electric Load Forecasting Using Multiple Output Gaussian Processes and Multiple Kernel Learning,"Abstract—Electric load forecasting refers to forecasting the
electricity demand at aggregated levels. Utilities use the pre-
dictions of this technique to keep a balance between electricity
generation and consumption at each time and make accurate
decision for power system planning, operations, and maintenance,
etc. Based on prediction time horizon, electric load forecasting is
classified to very short-term, short-term, medium-term, and long-
term. In this paper, a multiple output Gaussian processes with
multiple kernel learning is proposed to predict short-term electric
load forecasting (predicting 24 load values for the next day) based
on load, temperature, and dew point values of previous days.
Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is used as a measure of
prediction accuracy. By comparing MAPE values of the proposed
method with the persistence method, it can been seen that the
proposed method improves the persistence method MAPE up to
4%."
154,Short-Term Electric Load Prediction in Smart Grid using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes Regression,"Abstract—Electric load prediction (ELP) can support smart
grid (SG) goals such as reliability and efficiency. In ELP, we
predict the electricity demand at aggregated levels which is very
vital for the proper functioning of SG and keeping a balance
between load and supply demand. ELP can be categorized as very
short-term, short-term, medium-term, and long-term ELP. In this
paper, we proposed multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP)
regression for hourly day-ahead short-term ELP (predicting 24
load values of the next day) based on load, temperature, and dew
point values of previous days. We evaluated the performance of
the proposed MOGP and compared it with the persistence and
multiple linear regression methods. The results show that the
proposed MOGP has a very good prediction accuracy."

with anyone and anything, using any network and any service. Thus, IoT is a huge dynamic global
network infrastructure of Internet-enabled entities with web services. One of the most important
applications of IoT is the Smart Grid (SG). SG is a data communications network which is integrated
with the power grid to collect and analyze data that are acquired from transmission lines, distribution
substations, and consumers. In this paper, we talk about IoT and SG and their relationship. Some IoT
architectures in SG, requirements for using IoT in SG, IoT applications and services in SG, and
challenges and future work are discussed."
154,Sensitivity of coherent cooperative transmission to synchronization errors,"Abstract—Coherent cooperative transmission is a potential
technical approach to overcome the constraints imposed by the
limited battery power encountered in many distributed networks
such as sensor and UAVs. In coherent cooperative transmission,
two, or more, spatially separated communications nodes act
as elements of an antenna array to transmit common data
to a destination. However, a key challenge in such distributed
systems is achieving synchronization among cooperative nodes.
This paper analyzes and evaluates performance of coherent
cooperative transmission in the presence of frequency, phase and
time synchronization errors when maximal ratio, equal gain and
and selection diversity transmission schemes are used by the
cooperative nodes."
154,Data synchronization for throughput maximization in distributed transmit beamforming,"Abstract—In distributed transmit beamforming, two, or more,
spatially separated communications nodes act as elements of an
antenna array to beamform common data to a destination node.
Spatially separated cooperating nodes synchronize their carrier
frequencies and control their transmission phases so that at the
destination node the received signals combine constructively. An
important example is cooperative communications from a cluster
of small satellites to a ground station. The focus of this paper is
on optimizing the number of packets that each cooperative node
should send to others during each data sharing time interval
in order to maximize the data throughput during distributed
transmit beamforming stage. The problem is formulated as an
optimization problem and a novel heuristic method is proposed
to obtain the optimum solutions, as an alternative to the ex-
haustive search with high computational complexity. Simulation
results show that the proposed heuristic method has excellent
performance compared to the exhaustive search but with very
low computational complexity.

advanced metering infrastructure architecture to collect the
measured data of smart meters and other devices such as power
measurement units from different parts of the electrical grid
and sends them to the central system to be analyzed for billing
or other purposes and being stored. In this paper, we propose
a three-layer aggregation architecture for advanced metering
infrastructure in smart grid which deploys the M/M/1 queuing
system. We develop models to calculate energy consumption of
data aggregation points (DAPs) and packet delay. We derive
expressions for energy consumption of DAPs, total cost of relay

metric, the multiplication of energy and cost (EC), to ﬁnd the

measurement units from different parts of the power grid and
analyzes them for billing and sends the collected data to the
utility center for further analyses and being stored. In this
paper, we propose a three-layer aggregation architecture for
advanced metering infrastructure in smart grid based on the
M/M/1 queuing system. We derive an expression for packet
delay and deﬁne three objective functions (total cost, payoff, and
cost-reward per unit time) based on two performance metrics
(congestion and load) in terms of service cost rate, waiting cost
rate, packet delay, reward, packet service rate, and packet arrival
rate. We obtain the optimum value of packet service and arrival
rates of collectors by minimizing or maximizing the proposed
objective functions."
154,Optimizing the Number of Collectors in Machine-to-Machine Advanced Metering Infrastructure Architecture for Internet of Things-Based Smart Grid,"Abstract—Internet of Things connects people and things at any
time and in any place. Smart grid is one of the promising appli-
cations of Internet of Things. Advanced metering infrastructure
is one of the most signiﬁcant components in smart grid which
collects data from smart meters and sends the collected data to
the utility center to be analyzed and stored. To implement two-
way communication between smart grid components, machine-
to-machine communications has a great potential. In this paper,
we propose a machine-to-machine architecture for advanced
metering infrastructure in Internet of Things-based smart grid
and focus on ﬁnding the optimum number of collectors based
on two metrics: collectors’ cost and packet delay. We model
advanced metering infrastructure as a queuing system and
derive an expression for packet delay. We also propose a new
performance metric, the product of cost and delay (CD), so that by
minimizing it, we can ﬁnd the optimum number of collectors. The
simulation results indicate correctness of our theoretical model

the most important components of smart grid which aggregates

aggregators in its neighborhood area network (NAN) based on
three metrics: regional aggregator (RA) power consumption, cost
of RAs and wide-area aggregator, and NAN lifetime. We have
developed a power consumption model for each RA and deﬁne
NAN lifetime based on that. We also deﬁned a new performance
metric, the product of power consumption and cost (PC), so that
by minimizing it, we can obtain the optimum number of RAs. The
simulation results indicate correctness of our theoretical model
and show that we can achieve a balance between NAN lifetime
and RAs’ cost.

154,Optimized scalable decentralized hybrid advanced metering infrastructure for smart grid,"Abstract—Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the
most important components of smart grid (SG) which aggregates
data from smart meters (SMs) and sends the collected data to
the utility center (UC) to be analyzed and stored. In traditional
centralized AMI architecture, there is one meter data management
system to process all gathered information in the UC, therefore, by
increasing the number of SMs and their data rates, this architecture
is not able to satisfy SG requirements (e.g., delay and reliability) and
it would not be scalable. Since scalability is one of most important
characteristics of AMI architecture in SG, in this paper, we have
investigated scalability of different AMI architectures and propose
a scalable hybrid AMI architecture. We have introduced three
performance metrics: monthly, ﬁxed, and total deployment cost of
AMI architecture as objective functions of corresponding optimiza-
tion problems. Based on these metrics, we formulated each AMI
architecture and used a genetic-based algorithm to minimize them
and ﬁnd their near optimal solutions. Based on the requirements of
ﬁve demographic regions (i.e., different density or number of SMs)
and range of SMs data rates, we simulated our proposed AMI
architecture and the results proved that our proposed AMI hybrid
architecture has better performance compared with centralized
and decentralized AMI architectures and it has a good load and
geographic scalability.

154,Using a genetic-based algorithm to solve the scheduling optimization problem for long-range molecular communications in nanonetworks,"Abstract—Inspired by nature, nanonetworks can expand the
capabilities of nanomachines with regards to execution of more
complex tasks, extension of workspace and coverage. Various
communication techniques such as acoustic, nanomechanical,
electromagnetic and molecular communications are proposed
for nanonetworks but molecular communication is the most
promising method. Molecular communication has three categories
in terms of distance between nanomachines: short range, medium
range, and long range. In this paper, axon-based molecular com-
munication as one of wired long range molecular communication
options in nanonetwork is studied. Since axon-based molecular
communication uses neural network (body area network (BAN))
as an underlying structure to connect nanomachines, neuron
and neural network are described. This paper uses a neural
time division multiple access (NTDMA) scheduling to allow
nanomachines to send their information through a shared neural
network to the destination nanomachine (sink) without any
collision and interference. In a NTDMA protocol, nanomachines
activate neurons, one after the other, in their own time slots. Since
determination of these time slots is a multi-objective optimization
problem, thus a genetic-based algorithm (GBA) is proposed to
solve it. Simulation results verify that GBA obtains the best
feasible solutions and outperforms some existing methods."

assigned to requested calls in a cellular mobile network subject to 
co-channel, adjacent channel and co-site constraints such that

algorithm is proposed to solve the channel assignment problem 
and Node-color and Node-degree ordering of cells and Row-wise 
and Column-wise ordering of calls and local search are used. The 
performance of proposed method is evaluated by solving 5

performance of proposed method is evaluated by solving six 
well-known benchmarks in channel assignment problems. 
Results show that this method can find more solutions with 
minimum required bandwidth in comparison with the other

155,Response Surface Modelling for Performance Analysis of Scientific Workflow Application in Cloud,"Abstract
Scientiﬁc workﬂow applications are used by scientists to carry out research in various domains such as Physics, Chemistry,
Astronomy etc. These applications require huge computational resources and currently cloud platform is used for efﬁ-
ciently running these applications. To improve the makespan and cost in workﬂow execution in cloud platform it requires
to identify proper number of Virtual Machines (VM) and choose proper VM type. As cloud platform is dynamic, the
available resources and the type of the resources are the two important factors on the cost and makespan of workﬂow
execution. The primary objective of this work is to analyze the relationship among the cloud conﬁguration parameters
(Number of VM, Type of VM, VM conﬁgurations) for executing scientiﬁc workﬂow applications in cloud platform. In this
work, to accurately analyze the inﬂuence of cloud platform resource conﬁguration and scheduling polices a new predictive
modelling using Box–Behnken design which is one of the modelling technique of Response Surface Methodology (RSM).
It is used to build quadratic mathematical models that can be used to analyze relationships among input and output
variables. Workﬂow cost and makespan models were built for real world scientiﬁc workﬂows using ANOVA and it was
observed that the models ﬁt well and can be useful in analyzing the performance of scientiﬁc workﬂow applications in

155,A Hybrid Firefly with Dynamic Multi-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization for WSN Deployment   825,"Abstract
Enhancing the coverage area of the sensing range with the 
limiting resource is a critical problem in the wireless sensor 
network (WSN). Mobile sensors are patched coverage holes 
and they also have limited energy to move in large distances. 
Several recent studies indicated the metaheuristic algorithms 
can find an acceptable deployed solution in a reasonable 
time, especially the PSO-based algorithm. However, the 
speeds of convergence of most PSO-based algorithms are 
too fast which will lead to the premature problem to degrade 
the quality of deployed performance in WSN. A hybrid 
metaheuristic combined with dynamic multi-swarm particle 
swarm optimization and firefly algorithm will be presented 
in this paper to find an acceptable deployed solution with the 
maximum coverage rate and minimum energy consumption 
via static and mobile sensors. Moreover, a novel switch 
search mechanism between sub-swarms will also be 
presented for the proposed algorithm to avoid fall into 
local optimal in early convergence process. The simulation 
results show that the proposed method can obtain better 
solutions than other PSO-based deployment algorithms 
compared in this paper in terms of coverage rate and energy 
consumption."

156,Compact Point-of-Care Device for Self-Administered HIV Viral Load Tests from Whole Blood,"ABSTRACT: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant problem to
consider as it can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fortunately,
AIDS is manageable through antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, frequent viral load
monitoring is needed to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy. The current reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) viral load monitoring is highly
effective, but is challenged by being resource-intensive and inaccessible, and its
turnaround time does not meet demand. An unmet need exists for an affordable, rapid,
and user-friendly point-of-care device that could revolutionize and ensure therapeutic
effectiveness, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this work, we explored a point-
of-care HIV viral load device to address this need. This device can perform streamlined
plasma separation, viral RNA extraction, and real-time reverse transcription loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) semiquantitative testing in an ultra-
compact device. We developed an absorption-based membrane plasma separation
method suitable for finger-prick blood samples, achieving an efficiency of 80%. We also designed a syringe-based RNA extraction
method for on-site plasma processing with a viral recovery efficiency of 86%. We created a portable device with a smartphone
interface for real-time semiquantitative RT-LAMP, which is useful for monitoring viral load. The device uses lyophilized reagents,
processed with our lyophilization method, which remain stable for 16 weeks. The device can accurately categorize viral load into low,
medium, and high categories with 95% accuracy. We believe this point-of-care HIV self-test device, offering convenience and long-
term storage, could aid patients in home-based ART treatment monitoring."
156,STAMP-Based Digital CRISPR-Cas13a for Amplification-Free Quantification of HIV-1 Plasma Viral Loads,"ABSTRACT: Quantification of HIV RNA in plasma is critical for identifying the disease progression and
monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. While RT-qPCR has been the gold standard for HIV viral load
quantification, digital assays could provide an alternative calibration-free absolute quantification method. Here, we
reported a Self-digitization Through Automated Membrane-based Partitioning (STAMP) method to digitalize the
CRISPR-Cas13 assay (dCRISPR) for amplification-free and absolute quantification of HIV-1 viral RNAs. The HIV-1
Cas13 assay was designed, validated, and optimized. We evaluated the analytical performances with synthetic RNAs.
With a membrane that partitions ∼100 nL of reaction mixture (effectively containing 10 nL of input RNA sample),
we showed that RNA samples spanning 4 orders of dynamic range between 1 fM (∼6 RNAs) to 10 pM (∼60k RNAs)
could be quantified as fast as 30 min. We also examined the end-to-end performance from RNA extraction to
STAMP-dCRISPR quantification using 140 μL of both spiked and clinical plasma samples. We demonstrated that
the device has a detection limit of approximately 2000 copies/mL and can resolve a viral load change of 3571
copies/mL (equivalent to 3 RNAs in a single membrane) with 90% confidence. Finally, we evaluated the device
using 140 μL of 20 patient plasma samples (10 positives and 10 negatives) and benchmarked the performance with
RT-PCR. The STAMP-dCRISPR results agree very well with RT-PCR for all negative and high positive samples with
Ct < 32. However, the STAMP-dCRISPR is limited in detecting low positive samples with Ct > 32 due to the
subsampling errors. Our results demonstrated a digital Cas13 platform that could offer an accessible amplification-
free quantification of viral RNAs. By further addressing the subsampling issue with approaches such as
preconcentration, this platform could be further exploited for quantitatively determining viral load for an array of
infectious diseases."
156,High Fidelity Machine Learning-Assisted False Positive Discrimination in Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Using Nanopore-Based Sizing and Counting,"Abstract
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method 
for developing point-of-care nucleic acid testing due to its isothermal nature. Yet, LAMP can 
suffer from the issue of false positives, which can compromise the specificity of the results. LAMP 
false positives typically arise due to contamination, non-specific amplification, and non-specific 
signal reporting (intercalating dyes, colorimetric, turbidity, etc.). While dye-labeled primers or 
probes have been introduced for multiplexed detection and enhanced specificity in LAMP assays, 
they carry the risk of reaction inhibition. This inhibition can result from the labeled primers with 
fluorophores or quenchers, and probes that do not fully dissociate during reaction. This work 
demonstrated a nanopore-based system for probe-free LAMP readouts by employing amplicon 
sizing and counting, analogous to an electronic version of gel electrophoresis. We first developed 
a model to explore LAMP kinetics, and verified distinct patterns between true and false positives 
via gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, we implemented nanopore sized counting, and calibrated the 
event charge deficit (ECD) values and frequencies to ensure a fair analysis of amplicon profiles. 
This sized counting method, integrated with machine learning, achieved 9"

HIV self-testing is an emerging innovative approach that allows individuals who want to know 
their HIV status to collect their own specimen, perform a test, and interpret the results privately. 
Existing HIV self-testing methods rely on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect the presence of 
HIV-1/2 antibodies, which could miss a significant portion of asymptomatic carriers during the 
window period. In this work, we present a fully integrated nucleic acid testing (NAT) device 
towards streamlined HIV self-testing using 100 µL finger-prick whole blood. The device consists 
of a ready-to-use microfluidic reagent cartridge and an ultra-compact NAT-on-USB analyzer. The 
test requires simple steps from the user to drop the finger-prick blood sample into a collection tube 
with lysis buffer and load the lysate onto the microfluidic cartridge, and the testing result can be 
easily read out by a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI). The microfluidic cartridge and 
the analyzer automatically handle the complexity of sample preparation, purification, and real-
time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). With a 
turnaround time of ~60 min, we achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 214 viral RNA copies/mL 
of whole blood at a 95% confidence level. Due to its ease of use and high sensitivity, we anticipate 
the HIV NAT-on-USB device would be particularly useful for the high-risk populations seeking 
private self-testing at the early stages of exposure."

Abstract
Nucleic acid testing has changed the diagnostic landscape, offering precise, rapid, and scalable 
detection platforms for various biological samples. The growing need for on-site diagnostics has 
driven the development of these technologies for point-of-care applications. Despite the recent 
advances, there are still significant challenges, the largest being sample preparation. Poor sample 
preparation can significantly diminish the sensitivity of downstream assays. There is a need for 
universal and portable sample preparation strategies to alleviate the bottle neck on NAT. In this 
work we present a semi-automated, easy-to-use, and portable centrifuge kit and device for the 
extraction of nucleic acids. Extraction reagents show stability out to 6-months of storage and 
device extractions on battery power remain viable out to 30 trials. Portable spin column procedures 
show an increased drying ability that does not affect PCR performance. Characterization of our 
portable centrifuge (varying rotor size and spin time) showed a maximum ΔCq of 0.45 and 0.71, 
respectively. Extractions using the portable centrifuge showed efficiencies greater than 84% for 
high concentrated samples with linearity (R2 = 0.811) between Cq time and RNA concentrations. 
The portable centrifuge showed a strong correlation (r > 0.96) and strong linearity (R2 > 0.92) 
when compared to the benchtop centrifuge when processing all three sample types: HIV RNA in 
buffer, HIV RNA in plasma, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Therefore, we present an easy-to-
use, semi-automated, and portable centrifuge kit and device for the universal preparation of nucleic 
acids in low resource areas."
156,The Figure of Merit for CRISPR-Based Nucleic Acid-Sensing System: Improvement Strategies and Performance Comparison,"Abstract
CRISPR-based nucleic acid-sensing systems have grown rapidly in the past few years. 
Nevertheless, an objective approach to benchmark the performances of different CRISPR sensing 
systems is lacking due to the heterogeneous experimental setup. Here, we developed a quantitative 
CRISPR sensing figure of merit (FOM) to compare different CRISPR methods and explore 
performance improvement strategies. The CRISPR sensing FOM is defined as the product of the 
limit of detection (LOD) and the associated CRISPR reaction time (T). A smaller FOM means 
the method can detect smaller target quantities faster. We found that there is a tradeoff between 
the LOD of the assay and the required reaction time. With the proposed CRISPR sensing FOM, 
we evaluated five strategies to improve the CRISPR-based sensing: preamplification, enzymes 
of higher catalytic efficiency, multiple crRNAs, digitalization, and sensitive readout systems. We 
benchmarked the FOM performances of 57 existing studies and found that the effectiveness of 
these strategies on improving the FOM is consistent with the model prediction. In particular, 
we found that digitalization is the most promising amplification-free method for achieving 
comparable FOM performances (~ 1 fM·min) as those using preamplification. The findings here 
would have broad implications for further optimization of the CRISPR-based sensing.

We have demonstrated a comparative study of ­NO2 gas sensing behavior of reactive sputtered growth ­WO3−x nanocrystalline

sion electron microscope characterizations demonstrate the formation of polycrystalline monoclinic phase of porous ­WO3-x

with that of ­W4+ and ­W5+. The Ag−WO3−x films exhibit a sensitivity of about 70% at 10 ppm, while ­WO3−x films show

157,A new strategy of defect passivation in kesterite absorber layer to engineer the band tailing for efficient carrier transport,"Abstract
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber materials are often associated with high non-radiative recombination and band tailing which 
results in poor material properties. Herein, we successfully employ a small molecule, triethanolamine, to passivate the charged 
point defects and dangling bonds not only on the CZTS surface but also within the CZTS absorber. The Urbach energy of 
treated CZTS absorber reduced by 0.29 eV besides increased bandgap value unraveled the passivation of band-edge tail states. 
The band-to-band transitions (~ 6 times) enhanced over band-to-tail transitions in PL spectra after the treatment representing 
the significant suppression of non-radiative recombination. Our studies reveal that due to passivation of CZTS surface, the 
interface trap density was substantially reduced, influencing charge carrier dynamics of CZTS/TiO2 heterojunction-based 
devices. This work provides an insight toward the unexplored direction of chemical treatment of CZTS absorber to modulate 
its optical and electrical properties."

157,Design and Analysis of P-GaN/N-Ga&#x2082;O&#x2083; Based Junction Barrier Schottky Diodes,"Abstract— This article proposes a new junction barrier
Schottky diode (JBSD) design based on P-GaN/N-Ga2O3
heterojunction with faster switching characteristics and
higher breakdown ability than the traditional two-terminal
power switches. Calibrated models have been used for
technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations of
the proposed JBSD after a comprehensive review of vari-
ous physical models and model parameters in the present
literature. Analysis in terms of static and transient behavior
for a varying proportion of PN area to the Schottky contact
area (PN:SBD ratio) was looked upon for the JBSD. With
the increase of PN:SBD ratio, the reverse voltage handling
capability increased as expected, but the reverse recovery
time and maximum reverse recovery current decreased.
This might be counterintuitive initially, as with an increase
in PN:SBD ratio, the PN behavior would dominate over SBD,
and slower transient behavior is expected. However, due to
redistribution of electric ﬁeld and the reduction in depletion
capacitance across the JBSD with increase in PN:SBD ratio,
JBSD with PN:SBD ratio of 8 gives us a breakdown at 1890 V
and a switching time of 9.72 ns. Furthermore, a comparison
of the transient response with state-of-the-art SiC Schottky
diode reveals the efﬁciency of the proposed structure in
terms of reverse recovery parameters to be signiﬁcantlybet-
ter, translating to 7.4 times lower power losses at higher fre-
quencies. Overall, the design and analysis presented here
suggest the promising potential of P-GaN/N-Ga2O3 vertical
devices for high-voltage and fast switching applications."

a
metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) device using sputter-

order of few fA (6.94 × 10−14 A) at 5 V because of
the enhanced depletion width at p/n heterojunction and
Pt/Ga2O3 metal–semiconductor contacts, which provides
a narrow path for free carriers to travel from one metal
contact to other under dark condition. The depletion layers
get thinner due to the absorption of UV-photons in the
UV-illumination condition. Hence, the photogenerated car-
riers get a wider channel to get collected at Pt-electrodes.
Thus, in addition to ultralow dark current, the device exhibits
an extraordinary photodetection characteristics, such as

In this article, β-Ga2O3 film was deposited on the p-Si (100) substrate using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique 
for rapidly emerging ­Ga2O3-based Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs). Although X-ray diffraction (XRD) result reveals a 
polycrystalline trending film, a smooth and uniform as-grown surface has been characterized by atomic force microscope 
(AFM) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Further, we have investigated metal–semiconductor 
(M–S) contact behavior of the fully vertical SBDs with the four different metals such as aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), gold 
(Au), and platinum (Pt) on ­Ga2O3 after forming ohmic contacts on the backside of the Si substrate. The barrier heights of 
all four metals are typically in the range of 0.51–0.69 eV and 0.72–"

157,Journal Pre-proof,"Abstract 
Cost-effective integration with existing silicon CMOS electronics has been one of the primary motivations for most 
of the emerging non-silicon devices. In this context, β-gallium oxide (Ga2O3) films were deposited on Si (100) 
substrate using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique in this research. After deposition, samples were further 
annealed at 600  and 800  under vacuum. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was employed to observe the crystallinity 
variation due to the annealing. The crystallinity of samples degrades with annealing at 600  and an incremental 
improvement in crystallinity was again exhibited at 800  due to the possible rearrangement of the Ga and O atoms 
to their optimal sites. Further, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for identification of elements and 
chemical composition. XPS results were also analyzed to locate the position of Ga 2p and Si 2p core levels and 
calculate the valance band offset (VBO) at Ga2O3/Si interface. Reflected electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS) 
and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were utilized to calculate the bandgap and work function, 
respectively. Moreover, valance band maxima and Fermi level position of the as-deposited and annealed samples 
were calculated using UPS. The bandgaps for the as-deposited, annealed samples at 600  and 800  were 
estimated to be 4.72±0.05, 4.52±0.05, and 4.48±0.05 eV, respectively. Consequently, the work function of the 
sample increases with annealing due to increase in the oxygen vacancies and resulting bandgap narrowing. The band 
offsets (valance band, conduction band) were determined to be (3.35±0.05 eV, 0.26±0.02 eV), (3.55±0.05 eV, 
0.15±0.02 eV) and (3.54±0.05 eV, 0.17±0.02 eV) for the as-deposited, annealed samples at 600  and 800 , 
respectively. This optimization of band alignment with annealing temperature shall be very useful for controlling the 
carrier transport at the interface for Ga2O3/Si based devices. Thus, a trade-off is to be performed between VBO and 
crystallinity of the Ga2O3/Si to operate the devices efficiently and reliably respectively."

158,A new SOI sensor design for detecting cancer using hybrid waveguide with higher sensitivity than both strip and slot waveguides,"Abstract
A new highly accurate optical biomedical sensor is proposed for cancer detection charac-
terized by high sensitivity, small footprint, low cost, and low limit of detection. The sen-
sor is based on double-ring resonators made of silicon on insulator. The type of the wave-
guide is critical in determining the sensor performance. To compromise the advantages and 
disadvantages of strip and slot waveguides, a mixed design of both has been introduced 
in literature at the expense of increased footprint compared to traditional sensors. Indeed, 
almost 27-fold footprint increase is required to improve the sensitivity by only one third 
of that of slot waveguide’s sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a new design that keeps 
the same footprint of traditional sensors, while achieving high sensitivity. This sensitivity 
depends on the resonance wavelength shift due to different refractive indices of the biosa-
mple. It has the value 109.8 nm/RIU compared to 55.57  nm/RIU and 129.621 nm/RIU for 
strip and slot waveguides, respectively. The hybrid waveguide quality factor is 537.7 while 
the quality factors of the strip and the slot waveguides are 627.99 and 380.76, respectively. 
In addition, the new design achieves the minimum limit of detection (0.0255) when com-
pared to that of traditional designs. Furthermore, a new method of detection is proposed 
with the same design, providing a higher sensitivity over both traditional waveguide types 
with a value of 15.3, compared to 13.2 and 1"

158,A low-cost microfluidic flow stabilizer for enhancing QCM measurement stability in in-liquid bio-applications,"Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a powerful sensing technique widely used in various
applications, including biosensing, chemical analysis, and material science. In in-liquid
applications, QCM measurements are susceptible to ﬂuctuations in ﬂuid ﬂow rate, which can
introduce unwanted noise and compromise the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. In this
work, we present an approach to enhance the stability of QCM measurements by utilizing a
microﬂuidic ﬂow stabilizer. The ﬂow stabilizer is designed to minimize ﬂow rate ﬂuctuations,
thereby reducing the impact of hydrodynamic effects on the QCM frequency response. We employ a
comprehensive methodology that combines computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations using
ANSYS Fluent software, microfabrication, and experimental testing to evaluate the effectiveness of
the ﬂow stabilizer in mitigating ﬂow-induced ﬂuctuations and improving the reliability of QCM
measurements. For fabrication, we use direct engraving with a CO2 laser beam on polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) material to drastically reduce the fabrication cost (to <40 cents) and
fabrication time (to 35 min) of the microﬂuidic chip. Two different designs have been presented and
tested: one with a single air reservoir and the other with two reservoirs. Two distinct setups
employing a peristaltic pump and a micropump, along with a high fundamental frequency of
50 MHz QCM sensor, were utilized for comprehensive testing in this study. The experimental results
demonstrated that the ﬁrst and second designs of the microﬂuidic ﬂow stabilizer effectively reduced
the ﬂuctuation amplitude in QCM measurements from 100% (input) to 23% and 19% (output),
respectively."

Moreover, IoT devices are randomly deployed on land, space, and

158,A Microwave Sensor Based on Double Complementary Split-Ring Resonator Using Hexagonal Configuration for Sensing Diabetics Glucose Levels,"Abstract— In this article, we propose a compact microwave

shaped complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRS), lined up 
in honey-cell configuration, fabricated on Rogers RO3210 
substrate, and fed by a 50 Ohm microstrip line. For sensing 
glucose, the index and middle figures are placed on the sensing

sensor is validated experimentally using a convenient setup of a 
vector network analyzer (VNA) that operated in measuring the 
transmission coefficient S21 and the phase. The sensor showed

presented, consisting of a double square complementary split-
ring resonator (CSRR) over the frequency range (0–7 GHz). 
This unique structure is novel in this application. The main 
concept of the proposed sensor is the concentrated, confined 
electric field over the sensing region, which results in sensitivity 
enhancement. The double CSSR sensor is theoretically studied 
and numerically modelled using Computer Simulation 
Technology (CST) software. The sensor’s sensitivity is 
illustrated through simulation in the range of 40-500 mg/dL. In-
vitro, experiments are held using de-ionized water glucose 
solutions within the clinical diabetic range. Results show a high 
sensitivity performance up to 0.0056 dB/(mg/dL). Hence, our 
sensor ensures the capability of monitoring the glucose changes 
either for hypo (40 mg/dL) or hyperglycemia (500 mg/dL) cases

non-contact sensing and being sensitive to changes in all types of electrical characteristics.As there is risk of loss of life

159,Optimization of MFCC parameters for mobile phone recognition from audio recordings,"Abstract: Recent researches in the domain of electronics 
and telecommunication have made available various low price 
chips into a single smaller device. In the similar fashion, mobile 
phones are now equipped with efficient audio, video and image 
recorders. With the extended facilities and ease of use, it is 
frequently used to take photographs, videos and audio 
recordings. As the use of these devices increased, its use in 
criminal activities also increased. In such a scenario, the available 
recording may help in detection of its source device from which it 
has originated. Source device identification from audio recording 
is one of the major problems in the multimedia forensics.  In this 
paper, we perform a study for optimization of MFCC (Mel

Many of the technologies has been developed and 
tested across various test sites and in different

thresholding. This needs correct selection of threshold value 
as single value of threshold will not give proper separation in 
all the images. Hence adaptive threshold method is chosen.In 
this work, the threshold value is chosen automatically by 
using weight updating algorithm. Thresholding leads to 
binarization of image. This technique is mainly applicable for 
bimodal images (images which contain two dominant peaks in 
histogram).It is implemented on FPGA platform using VHDL 
language and results are presented using simulation and 
implementation on hardware which are based on fixed point 
data types and give accurate threshold value."

(DPC) of three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectiﬁer with con-
stant switching frequency using space-vector modulation (SVM).
The developed DPC scheme is based on the predictive control strat-
egy to achieve direct control of instantaneous active and reactive
power of the converter. For this purpose, at the beginning of each
switching period, the required rectiﬁer average voltage vector al-
lowing the cancellation of active and reactive power tracking er-
rors, at the end of the switching period, is calculated by means of
predictive control algorithm in the sense of deadbeat control. The
main advantages of the proposed control, compared to the works
published in this subject, are that no need to use predeﬁned switch-
ing table and voltage vector or virtual ﬂux position, PI-based active
and reactive power control loops are not necessary and constant-
switching frequency. The proposed predictive direct power control
was tested both in simulations and experimentally and compared
with DPC using switching table. Results have proved excellent per-

which is much better than conventional DPC using switching
table."
160,Fuzzy-Logic-Based Switching State Selection for Direct Power Control of Three-Phase PWM Rectifier,"Abstract—This paper proposes a novel and simple direct power
control (DPC) scheme of a three-phase pulsewidth-modulated rec-
tiﬁer without the use of a predeﬁned switching table. The converter
switching state selection is based on fuzzy logic rules, using the
instantaneous active and reactive power tracking errors as fuzzy
logic variables. The basic idea of fuzzy rules synthesis is based
on the knowledge of the instantaneous variation of active and
reactive power. According to the input fuzzy variables and in a
speciﬁc moment, the best switching state of the converter is chosen
to restrict the instantaneous active and reactive power tracking
errors simultaneously, for maintaining the dc-bus voltage close to
the reference value and guarantying the unity-power-factor opera-
tion. The main advantages of the proposed DPC scheme, compared
to the classical one, are that it is not necessary to use hysteresis
comparators, and smooth control of active and reactive power is
obtained during all sectors. Finally, the developed DPC was tested
both in simulations and experimentally, and illustrative results are
presented here. Results have proven excellent performance, and
verify the validity of the proposed DPC scheme which is much
better than the classical DPC."

160,Real-Time Genetic Algorithms-Based MPPT: Study and Comparison (Theoretical an Experimental) with Conventional Methods,"Abstract: Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods are used in photovoltaic (PV) systems to
continually maximize the PV array output power, which strongly depends on both solar radiation and
cell temperature. The PV power oscillations around the maximum power point (MPP) resulting from
the conventional methods and complexity of the non-conventional ones are convincing reasons to
look for novel MPPT methods. This paper deals with simple Genetic Algorithms (GAs) based MPPT
method in order to improve the convergence, rapidity, and accuracy of the PV system. The proposed
method can also efﬁciently track the global MPP, which is very useful for partial shading. At ﬁrst,
a review of the algorithm is given, followed with many test examples; then, a comparison by means
Matlab/Simulink© (R2009b) is conducted between the proposed MPPT and, the popular Perturb and
Observe (PO) and Incremental Conductance (IC) techniques. The results show clearly the superiority
of the proposed controller. Indeed, with the proposed algorithm, oscillations around the MPP are
dramatically minimized, a better stability is observed and increase in the output power efﬁciency is
obtained. All these results are experimentally validated by a test bench developed at LIAS laboratory
(Poitiers University, Poitiers, France) using real PV panels and a PV emulator which allows one to
deﬁne a proﬁle insolation model. In addition, the proposed method permits one to perform the test of
linearity between the optimal current Imp (current at maximum power) and the short-circuit current
Isc, and between the optimal voltage Vmp and open-circuit voltage Voc, so the current and voltage
factors can be easily obtained with our algorithm."
160,Analysis and design of new switching table for direct power control of three-phase PWM rectifier,"Abstract— in this paper, a new switching table is 
presented for direct power control (DPC) of three-phase 
PWM rectifiers. The proposed switching table is synthesized 
by analyzing the instantaneous active and reactive power 
correction. For this reason, and based on the sign and 
magnitude of the change in instantaneous active and 
reactive power, the best converter switching state allowing 
smooth control of active and reactive power simultaneously 
during each sector is selected. The dc-bus voltage is 
maintained at the required level by controlling active power 
to be constant and equal to its reference value. The unity 
power factor (UPF) operation of the converter is achieved 
by maintaining the reactive power zero during all sectors. 
Simulation and experimental results have proven that the 
proposed DPC is much better than the classical one and 
verify the validity and performance of the presented DPC."

proposed in active power filtering these last years, often assuming 
that all the components are well sized, or at least they do not

designing an active filter is to select suitable values. This allows to 
reduce costs and avoids a lot of control problems. This paper 
deals with design, simulation and experimentation of a Shunt

recalling and comparing some methods already published in this

160,Energy management and power quality enhancement in grid‐tied single‐phase PV system using modified PUC converter,"Abstract: Pack U-Cell (PUC) multi-level inverter is an attractive topology which widely investigated in the past few years for
renewable energy conversion systems. This study introduces a modified five-level packed Unit-cell converter (MPUC5) for
single-phase double stage grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system with unity power factor. The proposed system operates as a
single-phase active power filter able to compensate reactive power generated by non-linear loads connected to the point of
common coupling, feeds the non-linear load by the generated PV power, and injects the extra power into the grid. The MPUC5
inverter has a special topology with two DC-link capacitors and six switches. One DC-link of the inverter is connected to the PV
arrays through DC/DC Cùk converter to draw the maximum power. Therefore, finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-
MPC) for such configuration appears as a promising alternative for this inverter to work properly. Where the proposed FCS-MPC
algorithm is designed to ensure a high grid current quality, taking into consideration the issue of the capacitor voltages balancing
and the switching frequency minimisation. Both simulation results and experimental validation through real-time hardware in the
loop system prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed control scheme, regarding PV power management and quality
enhancement.

160,A Robust Control of Two-Stage Grid-Tied PV Systems Employing Integral Sliding Mode Theory,"Abstract: This contribution considers an improved control scheme for three-phase two-stage grid-tied
photovoltaic (PV) power systems based on integral sliding mode control (ISMC) theory. The proposed
control scheme consists of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), DC-Link voltage regulation
and grid current synchronization. A modiﬁed voltage-oriented maximum power point tracking
(VO-MPPT) method based on ISMC theory is proposed for design of an enhanced MPPT under
irradiation changes. Moreover, a novel DC-Link voltage controller based on ISMC theory is proposed
to achieve good regulation of DC-Link voltage over its reference. To inject the generated PV power into
the grid with high quality, a voltage-oriented control based on space vector modulation (SVM) and
ISMC (VOC-ISMC-SVM) has been developed to control the grid current synchronization. Numerical
simulations are performed in a MATLAB/SimulinkTM (R2009b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA)
environment to evaluate the proposed control strategy. In comparison with conventional control
schemes, the developed control strategy provides an accurate maximum power point (MPP) tracking
with less power oscillation as well as a fast and an accurate DC-Link regulation under varying
irradiation conditions. Moreover, the transfer of the extracted power into the grid is achieved with
high quality."
160,Neuro-fuzzy classifier for fault detection and classification in photovoltaic module,"Abstract— The reliability increase of a photovoltaic (PV) 
module, thus PV systems, passes through an efficient diagnosis 
process. This can be achieved by the use of two main techniques 
such as fault detection and fault classification.  Identifying faults 
by using classification algorithms gives us a better knowledge 
about a fault nature. However, faults may have the same numeric 
signature by using conventional methods that consider only a 
presence or absence of symptoms or residues. This paper 
proposes a fault detection and classification algorithm using a 
neuro-fuzzy classifier. The faults being in concerns are relating to 
series losses, defect by-pass diode and blocking diode faults. The 
fault diagnosis based parameters are maximum power and, open-
circuit voltage deviations, that are used as defect PV system 
symptoms.  The method has been found proficient for fault 
detection   and shows good discrimination for the most frequently 
occurring PV module faults."
161,1,"Abstract 
 
The electrical grid which enables our modern way of life was conceived more than 100 years 
ago. The industrial and consumer loads and generator technologies of the past were all based 
on alternating current (AC), leading to today’s AC electrical network. However, new 
generation technologies like solar and wind power, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) and 
battery storage all use direct current (DC). Our appliances, computers, smartphones, heat-
pumps and more, as well as common industrial loads, such as variable speed drives, are also 
mostly DC based. Because of this, many converters are needed to interface generation and 
loads to the AC grid, creating inefficiency and causing compatibility problems. 
 
A more efficient and sustainable electrical grid is needed which can easily accommodate new 
renewable technologies. Conveying electrical power by DC reduces losses and lessens voltage 
drop. A partial transition of our electrical grid to DC has many technological benefits, including 
more flexible and efficient systems for generation, conveyance, storage and use, as well as 
easier integration of renewable generation and technologies such as EVs and battery storage. 
 
The electrical grid is a critical player in reducing emissions of both greenhouse gases that lead 
to climate change, and other pollutants. There is a need to quickly adapt how we produce, use, 
transport and manage energy, to minimise the impact on the environment. Changes have begun 
worldwide with initiatives to increase renewable and sustainable electricity generation, uptake 
of EVs, and electrification of industrial processes. All these reduce fossil fuel consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions. However, further initiatives are needed to address the impact on the 
environment. Many of these initiatives will require a hybrid AC/DC grid — a system which 
integrates DC conveyance with the existing AC electrical network. 
 
The major research challenge is to determine the future architecture, topology and a transition 
pathway. As part of the government’s Strategic Science Investment Fund on Advanced Energy 
Technology Platform, the 7-year project “Architecture of the Future Low-Carbon, Resilient, 
Electrical Power System” has been awarded to address these questions and to develop 
capability to deliver the transition. This paper will describe the primary workstreams, their 
research objectives and expected outcomes. 
 
Our team comprises of researchers from the New Zealand (Universities of Canterbury, 
Auckland, AUT, Victoria, Waikato) and overseas, and dozens of overseas collaborators. 
Together, the key challenges of the future grid is tackled and technical capability is built, 
ultimately benefitting every New Zealander.

161,"EEA Conference & Exhibition 2021,","ABSTRACT
Faults in electricity distribution networks have the potential to ignite ﬁres, cause elec-
trocution, and/or damage the system itself. High-current Low-Impedance Faults (LIF) are
typically detected and mitigated via over-current, distance, directional relays, fuses, etc. In
contrast, while High Impedance Faults (HIF) are equally hazardous, they are much more
challenging to detect due to the fault current being much lower than load currents and
their time-varying and nonlinear behaviour. A solution for HIF detection will require, ﬁrstly,
the continuous observation of system current waveforms and, secondly, the development of
sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms to apply to these measurements. However, New
Zealand distribution networks are extensive and largely unmonitored beyond the substation,
and suitable HIF detection schemes are still an ongoing research challenge.
Robinson Research Institute has been developing a solution to enable widespread mon-
itoring of overhead lines in distribution networks and detecting faults. The sensing system
we have developed and are evaluating utilizes magnetic ﬁeld sensors (speciﬁcally the Giant
Magneto Resistive type), pole-mounted at a distance from the overhead lines for ease of
installation. These sensors are an attractive option compared to traditional current transformers
(CTs) due to their non-contact sensing ability, wide frequency bandwidth, low cost, miniature
size, and ease of integration with required digital componentry. Coupled with the algorithms
we have developed, these sensors allow observation of the individual overhead line currents
and detect both Low Impedance and High Impedance faults.
To date, we have built a physical test facility for power system fault analysis and the
development and evaluation of our sensing and fault detection system. We have simulated
LIF and HIF with different fault surface materials and load-switching events. From the data
collected, we have characterized the unique fault behaviour for both LIF and HIF in 400V
networks and trained a Deep Learning classiﬁer to recognize the type of fault present from
its unique signature. We have developed an outdoor pole-mountable sensing system and have
installed this in Wellington Electricity’s network for ongoing data collection and evaluation.
This paper will describe the test facility and our experience developing and implementing
the sensing system. The widest range of HIF phenomena observed was in the fault experiments
involving the tree branch. For brevity, therefore, this paper reports on the results of just these
tree-branch experiments. HIF faults on other surface materials will be reported elsewhere.
Finally, we will detail the pole-mountable sensing system installed in Wellington Electricity’s
network and the outcomes thus far.

161,Steam-Water Relative Permeability,"ABSTRACT 
Geothermal Energy is the thermal energy derived from the 
earth's subsurface, often extracted from steam or hot water. 
It is a clean, reliable, and promising source of renewable 
energy. However, geothermal fluids brought to the surface 
through production wells contain non-condensable gases and 
minerals. These gases can reduce the heat transfer efficiency 
process in the surface plant, impacting the turbine's 
efficiency when used to generate electricity. The gases 
mainly constitute CO2. 
The paper demonstrates two process models one calculating 
the output from the turbine for similar input conditions as in 
one of the geothermal powerplant in New Zealand and the 
second calculating the change in heat transfer efficiency of 
the heat exchanger for a given concentration of gases in the 
geothermal fluid. The second process model is a cut-down 
model of the heat exchanger from the complete process 
model developed, which helps understand the loss of 
efficiency in heat transfer when geothermal fluid with 
different concentrations of gases passes through it. The heat 
exchanger is run for a range of values of the concentration of 
gases. The primary focus is on evaluating the change in heat 
transfer efficiency in the heat exchanger."
161,Exploring the Potential of Neural Networks to Predict Statistics of Solar Wind Turbulence,"Abstract  Time series data sets often have missing or corrupted entries, which need to be handled in 
subsequent data analysis. For example, in the context of space physics, calibration issues, satellite telemetry 
issues, and unexpected events can make parts of a time series unusable. This causes problems for understanding 
the dynamics of the heliosphere and space weather environment. Various approaches exist to tackle this 
problem, including mean/median imputation, linear interpolation, and autoregressive modeling. Here, we 
study the utility of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict statistics of sparse time series. Our focus is 
not on time series prediction but on gleaning the best possible information about the statistical behavior of the 
system. As an example application, we focus on the structure functions of turbulent time series measured in the 
solar wind. Using a data set with artificial gaps, a neural network is trained to predict second-order structure 
functions and then tested on an unseen data set to quantify its performance. A small feedforward ANN, with 
only 20 hidden neurons, can predict the large-scale fluctuation amplitudes better than mean imputation or linear 
interpolation when the percentage of missing data is high. Although they perform worse than the other methods 
when it comes to capturing both the shape and fluctuation amplitude together, their performance is better in a 
statistical sense for large fractions of missing data. Caveats regarding their utility, the optimization procedure, 
and potential future improvements are discussed.
Plain Language Summary  We explore the utility of machine learning to predict statistics of a 
turbulent system such as the solar wind, in cases involving large data gaps. It is shown that simple artificial 
neural networks (ANNs) are good at estimating large-scale features of second-order structure functions even for 
very large amounts of missing data. However, these simple ANNs are limited in estimating other features of the 
structure functions, such as inner and outer scales, and the inertial range slope. More sophisticated methods are 
required to describe such features. Developing such a method is key to improving space weather models (e.g., 
the functions that couple solar wind parameters to space weather) in the face of incomplete data.

161,Practical framework for microgrid design,"Abstract 
Decentralized microgrid systems have provided electricity to off-grid communities, devoid of 
the necessary energy services, for a number of decades. However, in many instances 
microgrid systems have failed in delivering sustainable electricity supply. This has resulted in 
communities, primarily residing in remote or islanded areas of developing countries, having 
lower social and economic resiliency compared to the urban areas with centralized grid 
connectivity. The lack of a detailed standard framework, for cross-sectional evaluation of the 
sustainability and reliability of microgrid systems, has been identified. This chapter then 
introduces a conceptual framework to improve the design of remote microgrid systems. The 
framework comprises of modules that incorporate essential features, such as stakeholder 
engagement, sustainability aspects, energy management, and improving energy efficiency, as 
well as overall system autonomy – when undertaking the analysis and design of microgrids. 
The process, to make the framework practical, was established through the Working Group 
on Sustainable Energy Systems for Developing Communities (SESDC) of the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The outcomes when applying the framework, and 
associated process, are demonstrated with a case study in India. The outcomes show the

161,A Sensitivity Framework to Assess the Impact of Weather on Electric Power Networks,"Abstract—This manuscript provides an analytical sensitivity
framework to assess the impacts of individual weather param-
eters on conductor temperature and to determine the weather
parameters that have greater potential to impact power networks
and hence power system studies, which can be applied to any
region around the globe. Application to weather parameter
ranges possible across all of New Zealand (NZ) shows that the
conductor temperature and hence the power network is most
sensitive to the wind speed followed by the wind angle, and
the solar irradiance, when paired with the ambient temperature.
The sensitivity analysis framework is expected to aid utilities in
assessing the region-speciﬁc impact of weather parameters on
their network and hence improving their planning, operation,
and analysis."
161,Microsoft Word - 22942-63428-1-RV_Revised.docx,"ABSTRACT. Quality education and schools have a key role to play in the sustainable development of society. Unfortunately, many 
remote communities in developing countries fail to enjoy access to quality education due to a lack of electricity, thereby interrupting 
regular school services in the villages. The main objective of the paper contributes to understanding the importance of the energy-
education accord, and aims to curb the social challenges prevailing in the villages. Specifically, the paper suggests a technical 
intervention by designing a hybrid renewable energy system for such schools. The approach is demonstrated through a case study with 
a load demand of approximately 4 kWh/d, comprising a class size of 40 students. A techno-economic evaluation of the energy system 
reveals the levelized cost of energy of the system at USD 0.22 per kWh, which may be affordable considering number of other aspects, 
outlined in this paper, to enable a larger uptake of such systems in developing countries."
161,Proceedings of,"ABSTRACT 
This work aims to illustrate a sustainable socio-techno-
economic microgrid (SSTEM) design framework based on 
locally accessible energy resources such as solar, wind, 
hydro, etc. for remote/rural electrification purposes in the 
context of developing and least developing nations. The 
proposed SSTEM framework consists of separate three sub-
design levels integrated as one all-inclusive design process. 
The 
outlined 
framework 
can 
incorporate 
several 
combinations of the available energy resources in the 
vicinity such as hydrokinetic system (HKS), photovoltaic 
(PV), small wind turbine (SWT), etc. as primary energy 
sources with pump hydro system (PHS) and battery as 
energy storage and diesel generator as a backup for 
designing the community microgrid. Many combinations of 
primary generating sources and storage systems are utilized 
in this study to determine the suitable alternative. A 
preliminary socio-techno-economic evaluation of different 
microgrid elements (energy technologies and storage 
systems) will be introduced in this first stage of the 
proposed design process using decision analysis tools based 
on a set of performance indicators. The best alternatives 
from each of the elements, i.e., renewable energy 
technologies (RETs) and energy storage systems (ESS) 
assessed on the anticipated performance indicators, will be 
obtained to be used for the next-level design process. In the 
subsequent design stage, the detailed feasibility (techno-
economic) analysis of the solutions by combining different 
elements (RETs and ESS), which are obtained after the first 
stage with diesel generator (DG) in different microgrid 
architectures will be performed with multi-objective 
optimization tool. Different sizes and costing of various 
microgrid elements in varying suitable architectures will be 
obtained after this stage. In the final stage multi-criteria 
decision making (MCDM) models will be utilized to 
determine the best possible microgrid based on suitably 
defined 
criteria 
for 
electrifying 
the 
remote 
villages/communities."
161,Solar Atlas of New Zealand from satellite imagery,"ABSTRACT
The utilisation of solar resources has become of utmost importance
for the transition of the global, carbon intensive economy. In New
Zealand the uptake of solar energy has increased substantially,
but the relative contribution to the overall energy mix is still
small. Previous research eﬀorts on the solar resource across the
country are revisited with improved satellite-modelled data from
Solargis to derive a solar atlas for the country. A comparison is
made with NIWA data, which shows that the modelled data are at
an adequate level of accuracy and improves our understanding of
the
solar
resource
at
an
appropriate
spatial
and
temporal
resolution. The solar atlas makes available a commercial satellite
data source and informs further investigations into how solar can,
and will, play a more meaningful role in our transition to a low
carbon future.

161,Reinjection as a solution to greenhouse gas,"Abstract—The purpose of this paper is to discuss emissions
from geothermal power plants in New Zealand. Geothermal
energy has been considered as a clean and sustainable source
of energy. However, the geothermal ﬂuid also contains the
greenhouse gases which are emitted to the atmosphere after
the electricity generation process. Releasing the gases to the
environment after the electricity generation process is neither
environmentally suitable and may not be economically feasible
if the price of carbon increases. These emissions have become
an issue of major concern with the draft advice of the climate
change commission recommending that high emitting power
stations be closed by 2030. Reinjection of the ﬂuid and the
gases back to the reservoir or using CO2 for industrial and
agriculture purpose seems to be a viable solution towards
achieving a zero-carbon emission target. Reinjection of separated
brine is routinely carried out and plays an important role in
the geothermal system as it provides pressure support which
acts as a barrier to cold water recharge to the reservoir and
reduces environmental impacts by deposing water back to the
reservoir. Though reinjection provides a feasible solution to the
water disposal problem, it can also harm to the reservoir by
creating problem such as thermal breakthrough. Therefore, we
need well planned and modelled strategies for reinjection systems,
that are site-speciﬁc as the geologic setting differs from site to
site. This paper will provide a qualitative understanding of the
various reinjection strategies in New Zealand and the response
of the geothermal system to those strategies. If the CO2 gas from
a geothermal power plant is reinjected into the reservoir there
may be impacts on surface features which may impact economic
and cultural factors. This work will outline a study that will
be undertaken to optimize the strategy for reinjecting CO2 gas
into a geothermal reservoir. The optimization will consider the
impacts on power generation, surface features and other factors."

161,Weather-Dependent AC Power Flow Algorithms,"Abstract—The weather-dependent power ﬂow (WDPF) algo-
rithm performs more accurate power ﬂow analysis (PFA) due
to the utilisation of the heat balance model of conductors. It is
explicitly parameterised in terms of typically available measured
weather parameters (ambient temperature, solar irradiance,
wind speed, and wind angle) and performs more accurate (PFA)
due to the utilisation of the heat balance model of conductors.
It is presented in rectangular form in the extant literature. The
WDPF algorithm accurately estimates the branch resistances, the
system states (current and voltages), the power losses, the branch
ﬂows, and the branch loadings via PFA. In this manuscript, we
propose and investigate a group of weather-dependent AC power
ﬂow algorithms. Namely, the partially decoupled WDPF, the
fast decoupled WDPF, and the sequential WDPF algorithm. In
addition, we also present the derivation of the WDPF algorithm in
polar form. An analysis of the convergence characteristic and the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is presented
via extensive simulations."
161,Investigation of the Impact of Weather on Multi-machine Transient Stability Analysis,"Abstract—Transient stability analysis (TSA) deals with instabil-
ity due to large disturbances in the power system. Traditionally,
TSA is performed by time-consuming time-domain simulations
based on simpliﬁed assumptions that do not model the weather-
dependent characteristics. However, weather affects power ﬂow
analysis (PFA). Therefore, an impact of weather on TSA is
anticipated. In this manuscript, the weather-dependent impacts
are fully modelled and considered for TSA of multi-machine
systems. Consequently, impact of weather on transient stability
of a multi-machine system is investigated by considering real
weather data. The inﬂuence of weather on TSA of transmission
and distribution networks by performing time-domain fault
simulations are carried out to demonstrate clearly that varying
weather conditions impact the machine rotor angles and critical
fault clearing times, causing these to vary with the weather,
unlike conventional multi-machine transient stability analysis
(MMTSA). It is also demonstrated that consideration of weather
for TSA is more suitable for distribution networks having high
R/X ratios and lower inertia."
161,Steam-Water Relative Permeability,"ABSTRACT 
Greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal power plants are a barrier to the growth of geothermal energy at present and in the future. 
The discharge of the gases associated with the electricity generation process from geothermal fluids to the atmosphere contradicts 
New Zealand's target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. These gases are dominated by carbon dioxide. Reinjecting the gases 
back into the reservoir by dissolving them in the separated brine could be one way of reducing emissions from the geothermal 
electricity generation process. Besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reinjection may help in mitigating silica scaling problems 
by making the reservoir fluids more acidic. This helps in the dissolution of minerals, which further helps in improving the permeability 
of the reservoir and contributes to variation in output from the production well.  
This paper discusses an analysis of the impact of the concentration of gases present in the reservoir on the mass flow rate from the 
production well. This is a result of changes in the thermodynamic properties of the fluid present in the reservoir. The analysis of the 
main parameters that contribute to the predicted mass flows will be presented. Well flows are estimated from production wells over 
the range of conditions found in New Zealand's geothermal production fields. It demonstrates the impact of reinjection of gases on 
different types of geothermal reservoirs through changes in mass flow rate from the production well."
161,Impact of Local Energy Trading on LV Distribution,"Abstract—This paper explores the potential of local energy
market (LEM) for optimising energy management in residential
communities, focusing on the rise of rooftop solar photovoltaic
(PV) systems and electric vehicles (EVs) in New Zealand. A
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based optimisation
model is developed to minimize operation costs and temperature
deviation of household hot water cylinders (HWCs) within the
LEM framework. For this, a detailed modelling of flexible devices
within the LV distribution network is implemented. The study
considers various scenarios with different penetration levels of
rooftop PV systems and EVs to assess the impact of local
energy trading on distribution networks. Real-time load data,
market prices, and statistical models are utilized for numerical
simulations. Results from numerical simulations demonstrate
that LEM significantly reduces operational costs compared to
traditional Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). How-
ever, the presence of storage devices can lead to increased peak
grid import in LEMs. The sensitivity analysis further revealed
that the LEM based model has fewer scenarios with reverse
power flow. The findings from this study highlighted the need
of appropriate energy management strategies for storage devices
within LEMs to mitigate grid overloading and to facilitate the
increased integration of EVs and PVs in distribution networks."
161,Steam-Water Relative Permeability,"ABSTRACT 
Unused wells in petroleum fields are readily available as a 
potential source of geothermal energy. To produce 
geothermal heat in a viable manner, borehole heat exchangers 
may be used in some of the available deep wells (> 500 m). 
Therefore, we aim to develop a rigorous modelling technique 
to evaluate such systems in deep oil and gas wells.  
We examine a mathematical model based on unsteady-state 
heat conduction for the coupled borehole-reservoir system. 
Using the analytical technique, our paper presents cases 
evaluated using the Method of Characteristics. We briefly 
discuss the challenges encountered while using the above 
method for a non-linear hyperbolic system of partial 
differential equations in a practical scenario. Finally, we 
adopt a numerical technique based on the Finite Difference 
Scheme to analyse transient heat transfer in a coupled 
wellbore-reservoir system. The paper also discusses a 
hypothetical case that uses borehole heat exchangers to 
supply geothermal heat in a greenhouse.  
We conclude that the numerical technique based on the finite 
difference scheme is appropriate to study deep borehole heat 
exchanger systems. The hypothetical case study of a 
greenhouse demonstrates the feasibility of using such systems 
to supply geothermal heat. Future work should perform a 
detailed economic study and develop a more rigorous 
analytical method to optimise the design of multi-borehole 
systems."
161,Steam-Water Relative Permeability,"ABSTRACT 
Extracting energy from petroleum fields is an attractive topic for research. In the Taranaki region, some of the depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs are prospective candidates for low-temperature geothermal development. This is because the hydrocarbon wells produce a 
large amount of coproduced water at the surface. 
Therefore, we analyse one of the hydrocarbon fields encountering fractured reservoirs in the Taranaki region. We aim to estimate the 
production rate and well separations to sustain generation capacity from the field for 10 years.  
We used the Volsung reservoir simulator to simulate the reservoir models using the MINC (the Multiple INteracting Continua) 
formulations and representative rock properties. Then we analysed the behaviour of the petroleum reservoir over time with the 
extraction of geothermal energy.  
It was found that a flow rate of 180 kg/s is sufficient to produce 6 MW of electricity and could be sustained for at least 10 years. The 
work suggests that the theoretical maximum production rate between production and reinjection well separated by 500 m would be 
220 kg/s before the production enthalpy declined below 20% of the initial value. But the field has several wells and larger separation 
between the production and injection wells. The model of the field has seen production rates of 180 kg/s to sustain a generation 
capacity of more than 6 MW without the evidence of any thermal breakthrough from the injection well over a period of 10 year. The 
model demonstrates the effective movement of the warmer fluids from the lower formations to the upper reservoir for higher 
production rates before the arrival of the cold waterfront from the reinjection well.  
For future analysis, it is recommended to conduct optimisation of the operation strategy in the field. A detailed thermo-economic 
study could also be performed to analyse the benefits of ultimate oil recovery, aquifer effect, and the onsite power demand."

Large numbers of mobile wireless nodes that can move randomly and join or leave the network at 
any moment make up mobile ad-hoc networks. A significant number of messages are delivered 
during information exchange in populated regions because of the Internet of Things' (IoT) 
exponential increase in connected devices. Congestion can increase transmission latency and packet 
loss by causing congestion. More network size, increased network traffic, and high mobility that 
necessitate dynamic topology make this problem worse. An adaptive Multipath Multichannel 
Energy Efficient (AMMEE) routing strategy is proposed in this study, in which route selection 
strategies depend on forecasted energy consumption per packet, available bandwidth, queue length, 
and channel utilization. While multichannel uses a channel-ideal assignment process to lessen 
network collisions, multipath offers various paths and balances network strain. The link bandwidth 
is split up into a few sub-channels in the multichannel mechanism. To reduce network collisions, 
several source nodes simultaneously access the channel bandwidth. The cooperative multipath 
multichannel technique offers several paths from a single source or from several sources to the 
destination without colliding or becoming congested. The AMMEE routing approach is the basis for 
path selection. A load- and bandwidth-aware routing mechanism in the proposed AMMEE chooses 
the path based on node energy and forecasts their lifetime, which improves network dependability. 
The outcome demonstrates a comparative analysis of various multichannel medium access control 
(MMAC) techniques, including Parallel Rendezvous Multi Channel Medium Access Protocol 
(PRMMAC), Quality of Service Ad hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (QoS-AOMDV), 
Q-learning-based Multipath Routing (QMR), and Topological Change Adaptive Ad hoc On-demand 
Multipath Distance Vector (TA-AOMDV) and the proposed AMMEE method. The results show 
that the AMMEE approach outperforms alternative systems."

The educational system of the twenty-first century is student-centered. Students are the generation 
that has seen firsthand the enormous expansion of online media represented by the Internet, virtual

networks and who have firsthand knowledge of those technologies. Additionally, the epidemic has raised 
public awareness of the need of for digital literacy. The increasing digitalization and modernization 
of every area of our lives to satisfy the needs of modern education is creating new chances for both 
teaching and learning.  The world over, more and more technology is being used to improve training 
and education, which eliminates the need to take into account regional factors that are associated with 
traditional education.  More and more educational establishments are using technology to improve

development (SD) in several ways, including mediating social conﬂicts and educating the public
on scientiﬁc and technological issues. This study aimed to evaluate the students’ agreement level

Behavioral dissemination, Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0), mediating (Education and Community
Awareness) and outcome (Sustainable Development) variables, the multivariate statistical method;
as a result, Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed. In order
to characterize potential links, a dependency model in the form of structural equations was built
based on the classiﬁcation of the questions. The correlations between the various parameters were
then conﬁrmed using statistical techniques. The authors used SEM structural equations, which
enabled them to ascertain the relationships between the overlapping parts in the subsequent step to
identify potential connections between the survey’s questions. Research has shown that education
and sustainable development have a close connection. And it is especially important to stay alert
and pick up information throughout the study. This study provides new information on sustainable

162,Understanding the Impact of Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Management on Green Innovation Practices and Organizational Performance: The Moderating Effect of Government Support,"Abstract: Understanding and predicting the relationship between big data analytics (BDA) and
knowledge management (KM) and how they complement each other is still an ambiguous and
strategically crucial issue. This study aims to investigate the interrelationships between BDA and
KM in fostering green innovation practices (GIP) and organizational performance and, in addition,
to explore the mediation effect of KM and how it can boost the impact of BDA on GIP. Based upon
the underpinning theories that cover the study’s research model, several hypotheses were proposed
and then examined. Using a cross-sectional research design, 174 questionnaires were collected from
medium and large Algerian manufacturing ﬁrms. The study applied smart PLS-SEM for data analysis.
The sorted results show that BDA positively impacts KM and GIP. The results also indicate that GIP
positively inﬂuences and increases ﬁrm performance. In addition, the ﬁndings reveal that government
support plays a signiﬁcant part in leveling up ﬁrms’ GIP. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the
critical impact of KM to polish the impact of BDA on GIP. This study highlights the necessity of
improving the technological and managerial aspects of BDA by determining valuable capabilities,
such as KM processes, to enhance organizational performance. Tracking business opportunities
and predicting their relevant threats has become a severe concern to knowledge-extensive ﬁrms.
Therefore, BDA can enable managers to absorb a large amount of data to increase the efﬁciency of
a business decision to ensure survival and advancement. The study discusses both practical and

However, various socioeconomic factors adversely impact the deployment of digital infrastructure,
such as 5G networks, in the countries of Oceania. The high-speed broadband ﬁfth-generation cellular
network (5G) will improve the quality of service for growing mobile users and the massive Internet

We determine the minimum number of MRRUs and mRRUs that can be installed in each area while

project-based IT organizations across various cities in Pakistan. This research adopts a quantitative
approach, employing software project houses as the unit of analysis. We selected 38 software
projects out of 50 using a multi-stage sampling method and analyzed the data using Smart PLS

of CCBs can substantially reduce TTM. Additionally, higher CCB performance can expedite TTM,
particularly when requirements lack precision initially. The study underscores the profound inﬂuence
of requirements uncertainty on TTM in software projects. It provides organizations with insights into
the critical role of CCBs, the consequences of uncontrolled changes in the absence or ineffectiveness
of CCBs, and how requirements uncertainty affects software project development and timelines. This

162,The role of awareness in appraising the success of E-government systems,"Abstract:  Worldwide governments are launching e-government (E-Gov) systems to 
ensure the superior delivery of services to their citizens. Ensuring the success of 
government-to-citizen (G2C), E-Gov systems is still challenging for various devel­
oping countries. To overcome this challenge, investigating the success of G2C E-Gov 
systems is important. This paper assesses the success of E-Gov systems from the 
perspective of a developing country. For this purpose, this research incorporates 
perceived-usefulness and perceived-trust variables into DeLone and McLean’s IS 
success model. A survey-based method was employed to collect data from 
Pakistani citizens. The PLS-SEM method was used for the validation of the concep­
tual model. Using the non-probability sampling technique, a sample of 264 usable 
cases was collected and used to analyze our model. It is evident from the outcomes 
of the study that information-quality has significant effects on the use of E-Gov and 
user-satisfaction, while service-quality, system-quality, and perceived-trust have 
significant effects on the use of E-Gov, user-satisfaction and perceived-usefulness. 
Further, the use of E-Gov, perceived-usefulness, and user-satisfaction have direct, 
significant impacts on the perceived-net-benefits. The practitioners are recom­
mended to concentrate on the three quality dimensions i.e. information quality, 
system quality, and service quality while preparing E-Gov applications. The role of 
governments is also important to launch awareness campaigns and motivate their 
citizens to use E-Gov services.

162,"Exploring Ethical, Ecological, and Health Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Cultured Meat among Generation Y and Generation Z","Abstract: Growing research and technological development is making the commercial production of
cultured meat as a sustainable alternative to livestock-derived meat an increasing reality. However, to
competitively position cultured meat on the food market, appropriate marketing and communication
tailored to speciﬁc demographics is required. We aimed to deﬁne the motives that inﬂuence the
willingness to include cultured meat in consumption based on age, speciﬁcally in Generation Z and
Generation Y. To achieve this, data from a questionnaire survey that asked about ethical, ecological and
health and safety factors around cultured meat was collected from 740 respondents (301 Generation Z
and 439 Generation Y) and analyzed using the Mann–Whitney test and structural equation modeling.
Generation Z were signiﬁcantly more likely than Generation Y (p < 0.05) to consider cultured meat
healthier than conventional meat because of the possibility of adjusting the composition and nutrient
content. Generation Z were also signiﬁcantly less concerned than Generation Y (p < 0.05) about the
consequences that consuming cultured meat might have on human health. In Generation Z, ethical,
ecological and health and safety factors signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced their willingness to consume cultured
meat (all p < 0.01). In conclusion, we conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of ecological and ethical awareness, as
well as health and safety, on willingness to include cultured meat in consumption; these areas could
be targeted when marketing cultured meat."
162,Sustainable development Universities—Opportunities & challenges on the road to society 5.0 from the key stakeholder perspective,"Abstract
There has been a growing push on universities worldwide to demonstrate how their work
contributes to the indicators of sustainable development goals. In addition to producing a
foundation of human resources to assist the change toward greater sustainability, universi-
ties may have a significant influence on individual behaviour. The article’s goal is to highlight
the potential and difficulties that the surveyed universities face as they work to construct a
5.0 society and pursue sustainable development. It does this by analysing students’ per-
spectives from these universities in ten different nations. A Computer-Assisted Web Inter-
viewing (CAWI) questionnaire was used for the study. The hypotheses about the
relationship between the university’s legal status and form of ownership and the level of stu-
dents’ awareness of sustainable development were verified. The findings indicated that by
promoting sustainable development, the universities under investigation had the opportunity
to garner interest and involve students. Nevertheless, this calls for funding, better educa-
tional initiatives, and a well-rounded strategy. Furthermore, encouraging a sustainable cul-
ture within the university ecosystem and openly sharing these efforts with students and the
general public will make universities more visible, respected, and driven, boosting involve-
ment and engagement in sustainability initiatives on campus."
163,Adaptive and Extensible Energy Supply Mechanism for UAVs-Aided Wireless-Powered Internet of Things,"Abstract—This article studies multiple unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (multi-UAVs)-enabled wireless-powered Internet of Things
(IoT), where a group of UAVs is dispatched as mobile power
sources to charge a set of ground IoT devices. Different from
the conventional radio-frequency (RF) wireless power trans-
fer (WPT) systems, magnetic resonance-coupled (MRC) WPT
systems can guarantee high power transfer efﬁciency without
the complete alignment, which is remarkable. In this article, we
extend the charging range by the wired connection between the
energy receiving systems and IoT devices. Due to the restric-
tion of carriable energy on the UAVs, designing the shortest
possible trajectory for each UAV is necessary. We formulate it
as a multidepots multi-UAVs trajectory optimization problem,
jointly with constraints of the UAV’s energy capacity and the
area of the target region, to maximize the resource utiliza-
tion of UAVs. To tackle this nonconvex problem, we decompose
it into two subproblems, i.e., hovering locations selection and
multi-UAVs trajectory optimization. For the ﬁrst subproblem, we
propose two approximation algorithms to obtain the near-optimal
solution in the sparse networks. Then, we adopt a heuristic
algorithm, a memetic algorithm-based variable neighborhood
search (MAVNS), to achieve the quasioptimal trajectory rapidly.
Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithms. New insights are inves-
tigated on the estimation of feasibility that whether the given
UAVs with energy capacity constraint can fully charge ground
IoT devices within open areas.

163,A Periodic and Distributed Energy Supplement Method Based on Maximum Recharging Benefit in Sensor Networks,"Abstract—The issue of using vehicles to wirelessly recharge
nodes for energy supplement in wireless sensor networks has
become a research hotspot in recent works. Unfortunately, most
of the researches did not consider the rationality of the recharg-
ing request threshold (RRT) and also overlooked the difference
of node’s power consumption, which may lead to the premature
death of nodes as well as low efﬁciency of wireless charging vehi-
cles (WCVs). In order to solve the above problems, a periodic
and distributed energy supplement method based on maximum
recharging beneﬁt (PDESM) is proposed in this article. First, to
avoid frequent recharging requests from nodes, we put forward
an annuluses-based cost-balanced data uploading strategy under
deterministic deployment. Then, one WCV in each annulus peri-
odically selects and recharges nodes located in this region which
sends the energy supplement requests. In addition, the predicted
values of power consumption of nodes are calculated out accord-
ing to the real-time energy consumption rate, and thus the most
appropriate RRT is obtained. Finally, a moving path optimization
scheme based on the minimum spanning tree is constructed for
distributed recharging. Simulation results show that PDESM per-
forms well on enhancing the proportion of the alive nodes as well
as the wireless recharging efﬁciency compared with node failure
avoidance online charging and ﬁrst come ﬁrst served. Moreover,
it also has an advantage in balancing the energy consumption
of WCVs."
163,SPECIAL SECTION ON COMMUNICATION AND FOG/EDGE COMPUTING TOWARDS,"ABSTRACT Intrusion detection as one of the most important approaches to guarantee wireless sensing
network security has been studied adequately in previous work. However, with the development of electronic
anti-reconnaissance technology, the intruder may obtain the location information of detection nodes and
perform path planning to avoid being detected. Such intruder is deﬁned as an ‘‘empowered intruder’’ who
will bring new challenges for traditional intrusion detection methods. Moreover, some subareas may have
coverage holes due to random initial deployment of detection nodes, the desired effect of detection cannot
be achieved. To address these issues, we propose a vehicle collaboration sensing network model, where
mobile sensing vehicles and static sensor nodes cooperate to provide intrusion detection against empowered
intruders. Our proposal (named as IDEI) consists of a target pursuit algorithm of mobile sensing vehicles and
a sleep-scheduling strategy of static nodes. Mobile sensing vehicles will track the empowered intruder and
ﬁll up the coverage breaches, while static nodes follow a sleep-scheduling mechanism and will be awakened
by detection nodes nearby when the intruder is detected. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare
our proposal with existing methods such as KMsn and MTTA in terms of intrusion detection performance,
energy consumption and moving distance of sensor nodes. The parameter sensitivity of IDEI is also studied
with extensive simulations. The theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposal can
achieve better efﬁciency and availability."
163,A Type of Virtual Force-Based Energy-Hole Mitigation Strategy for Sensor Networks,"Abstract—In the era of Big Data and Mobile Internet, how
to ensure the terminal devices (e.g., sensor nodes) work
steadily for a long time is one of the key issues to improve
the efﬁciency of the whole network. However, a lot of facts
have shown that the unattended equipments are prone to
failure due to energy exhaustion, physical damage and other
reasons. This may result in the emergence of energy-hole,
seriously affecting network performance and shortening its
lifetime. To reduce data redundancy and avoid the generation
of sensing blind areas, a type of Virtual Force based Energy-
hole Mitigation strategy (VFEM) is proposed in this paper.
Firstly, the virtual force (gravitation and repulsion) between
nodes is introduced that makes nodes distribute as uniformly
as possible. Secondly, in order to alleviate the “energy-hole problem”, the network is divided into several annuluses with
the same width. Then, another type of virtual force, named “virtual gravity generated by annulus”, is proposed to further
optimize the positions of nodes in each annulus. Finally, with the help of the “data forwarding area”, the optimal paths for
data uploading can be selected out, which effectively balances energy consumption of nodes. Experiment results show
that, VFEM has a relatively good performance on postponing the generation time of energy-holes as well as prolonging
the network lifetime compared with other typical energy-hole mitigation methods."
163,Trajectory Optimization for UAVs&#x2019; Efficient Charging in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks,"Abstract—Unmanned
aerial
vehicle
(UAV)-aided
Wireless
Rechargeable Sensor Network (WRSN) is a promising application
in providing sustainable power supply to the rechargeable sensor
nodes (SNs). Constructing a trajectory for the UAV to traverse all
SNs with the cheapest cost is an important issue in UAV-aided
WRSN. Although some exact algorithms and heuristic methods
have been proposed, they cannot achieve a superb result for the
large-scale scene within the tolerable time. In this paper, we study
the UAV‘s trajectory optimization problem from a novel viewpoint
that the designed trajectory should maximize the UAV’s energy
utilization efﬁciency. The maximum UAV’s energy utilization efﬁ-
ciency problem is decomposed as integer programming and non-
convex optimization problems. For the problem that UAV‘s charg-
ing position is ﬁxed, we have speeded the algorithm’s performance
by limiting the search direction, the initial search position, and the
search space. In the other case, where the power transfer efﬁciency
is unchangeable within a certain distance, a polynomial-time ran-
domized approximation scheme (PRAS) is presented to ﬁnd the
approximate minimum number of hovering locations. We have
presented TPA-FCP and TPA-ERC to solve the above problems,
respectively. The numerical results verify that our proposed algo-
rithms effectively reduce the length of optimal trajectory and the
time complexity. Besides, the energy carried by the UAV for the
speciﬁed task is predictable, which provides valuable information
for arranging the UAV’s ﬂight task."
163,Day-Ahead Optimal Scheduling of Electricity-Heat Microgrid Considering Demand Response,"Abstract—Aiming at the influence of fluctuation and 
randomness of new energy on microgrid operation, a microgrid 
system with multiple new energy power generation and energy 
coupling equipment is constructed, and an optimal scheduling 
strategy of electric heating microgrid considering demand 
response is proposed. Firstly, the mathematical model of each 
device is constructed. Secondly, the demand response is used to 
guide users to actively participate in load adjustment, so as to 
smooth the load curve. On this basis, a day-ahead optimal 
scheduling model is established with the objective of minimizing 
total operation cost. The simulation results show that the strategy 
can effectively improve the operational economy of microgrid."
163,A Type of Recharging Scheduling Strategy based on Adjustable Request Threshold in WRSNs,"Abstract—In order to utilize the advantages of the “Periodic 
Energy Replenishing” as well as the “Request Triggered 
Recharging” methods in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor 
Networks, a type of Recharging Scheduling Strategy based on 
Adjustable Request Threshold (RSS-ART) is proposed in this 
paper. The Double Recharging Request Thresholds (DRRTs) 
are set for each node to let them send out their requests in 
advance or later. In this way, the MCV is more likely to 
recharge nodes in urgent need of energy replenishment which 
enhances its energy efficiency. Moreover, to maximize the 
surviving rate of nodes and to balance the number of requests 
in each time period, we limit the traverse duration of each 
round for the MCV. Finally, the departure time of each round 
of traversal is calculated out with the help of the number of 
two kinds of requests (WRR and DRR) which enhances the 
flexibility for MCV to perform charging tasks. Experiments 
show that RSS-ART outperforms the compared methods in 
term of the surviving rate and energy efficiency of MCV with 
different network scales."
163,Research on Cost-Balanced Mobile Energy Replenishment Strategy for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks,"Abstract—In order to maximize the utilization rate of the Mo-
bile Wireless Chargers (MWCs) and reduce the recharging delay
in large-scale Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks (WRSNs),
a type of Cost-Balanced Mobile Energy Replenishment Strategy
(CBMERS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, nodes are assigned
into groups according to their remaining lifetime, which ensures
that only the ones with lower residual energy are recharged in each
time slot. Then, to balance energy consumption among multiple
MWCs, the moving distance as well as the power cost of the MWC
are taken as constraints to get the optimal trajectory allocation
scheme. Moreover, by further adjusting the amount of energy being
replenished to some sensor nodes, it ensures that the MWC have
enough energy to fulﬁll the recharging task and return back to
the base station. Experiment results show that, compared with
the Periodic recharging strategy and the Cluster based Multiple
Charges Coordination algorithm (C-MCC), the proposed method
can improve the recharging efﬁciency of MWCs by about 48.22%
and 43.35%, and the average waiting time of nodes is also reduced
by about 55.72% and 30.7%, respectively."
163,Human Gesture Recognition Based on CT-A Hybrid Deep Learning Model in Wi-Fi Environment,"Abstract—Human gesture recognition has become an
important aspect of human–computer interaction due to
the rapid development of human behavior sensing technol-
ogy in Wi-Fi environments. Although Wi-Fi-based gesture
recognition systems have achieved good accuracy within
specific domains, they still have limitations in terms of cross-
domain capability. In light of this, this article aims to explore
methods that can achieve high recognition accuracy within
specific scenes while also maintaining cross-scene capabil-
ity. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid deep
learning model that leverages a combination of convolu-
tional neural network (CNN) and the encoder module in the
Transformer. This model takes into consideration the spatial
localization characteristics and long-distance dependence
of gestures, which improves its ability to model the spa-
tiotemporal features in the body-coordinate velocity profile
(BVP) series. In addition, we enhance the model’s modeling
effect on spatiotemporal features in BVP series by extracting
low-dimensional vectors containing a significant amount of
classification information. These vectors are then fed into the Adaboost module for ensemble learning. Finally, a strong
classifier is used to compute the class of gestures. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conduct
experiments on a common dataset. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an average accuracy of 96.78%
and 88.27% in in-domain and cross-domain cases, respectively. This indicates the superiority and effectiveness of the
proposed approach."
163,Balanced Distribution Strategy for the Number of Recharging Requests Based on Dynamic Dual-Thresholds in WRSNs,"Abstract—“Request Triggered Recharging” has been a flexible
type of scheduling schemes to allow the Mobile Charging Vehicle
(MCV) to supply energy for sensor nodes on demand. However, in
most existing works, MCV always passively waits for the arrival of
the unpredictable requests that may cause it missing the best
departure time to serve nodes. To solve this problem, we propose a
Balanced Distribution strategy for the number of Recharging
Requests based on dynamic dual-thresholds (BDRR). Firstly, the
adjustable Double Recharging Request Thresholds (DRRTs) are set
for each node to ensure that all the requesting nodes can be
successfully charged. Then, the Method for Setting the Energy
Replenishment
Value
(MSERV)
is
proposed
to
enable
the
distribution of the moments at which nodes send out their
recharging
requests being
concentrated
within
each
period.
Furthermore, an efficient traversal path for the MCV is constructed
by safe or dangerous scheduling strategy, and the Charging
Capacity Reduction Scheme (CCRS) is also executed to help survive
more nodes in need. Finally, a Passer-by Recharging Scheme (PRS)
is introduced to further improve the energy efficiency of the MCV.
Simulation results show that BDRR outperforms the compared
algorithms in terms of surviving rate of sensors as well as the energy
efficiency of MCV with different network scales.

164,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Developing a Nursing Robot System: Preliminary design,"Abstract-- Regarding existing technology, people with 
disabilities tend to be monitored using video devices for 
occurrences of falls or dangerous situations. In addition, health 
monitoring devices such as blood pressure monitors and blood 
glucose meters can be set to enable automatic data 
transmission to medical staff and family members. Many older 
adults hesitate to allow monitoring equipment in areas such as 
bedrooms, bathrooms, and toilets, where they tend to fall. 
Moreover, requiring older adults to wear devices involves 
potential problems such as forgetting or unwillingness to wear 
them. This study involves to develop and manufacture a care 
robot featuring an artificial intelligence behavior model that 
evaluates emotional feedback. Within this paper we will 
complete the construction of the robot, which involves the use 
of a multi-sensor data fusion technique for achieving obstacle 
avoidance and allowing the robot to operate autonomously in 
dynamic environments and daily life scenarios. Moreover, the 
robot is equipped with a vision and voice recognition module 
to collect information on care receivers’ expressions,

164,Tracking Fluorescent Artificial Features on Cardiac Surface for Evaluating Heart Function,"Abstract—This study proposes a solution for accessing the 
heart functions after cardiac surgery by integrating a self-
developed NIR imaging system and optical flow method to track 
the NIR fluorescent artificial features on the cardiac surface.  
An animal test is performed to evaluate the imaging system and 
the possible approaches to extract heart performance from the 
features.  This study adopted two approaches: the movement of 
a single cardiac surface feature point and the evaluation of 
distance changes of two feature points, which have been 
implemented for analyzing the features.  The results of tracking 
the movement of a single cardiac surface feature point indicate 
the heartbeat and respiratory rates can be successfully 
determined, and an irregular myocardium shrink has been 
revealed.  As for adopting the distance changes of two feature 
points, results show that respiratory-introduced motion 
disturbance can be suppressed, and the heartbeat rates can be 
determined."

164,Enhancing the Performance of a Rainfall Measurement System Using Artificial Neural Networks Based Object Tracking Algorithms,"Abstract—With the recent development of optical sensing and 
digital image processing techniques, high-speed cameras have 
been applied to measure the microphysical properties of 
raindrops. However, the performance of such systems are 
significantly affected by object tracking algorithms.  In order to 
improve the measurement accuracy of rainfall rate and 
accumulated rainfall, a novel object tracking algorithm based on 
artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed in this paper. The 
ANN model takes the features of each raindrop in the two 
successive images as inputs including the center coordinates, 
area, canting angle, the lengths of long axis and minor axis of the 
equivalent ellipse. The output of the ANN model is the matched 
probabilities of each pair of raindrops between before and after
images. Experimental data were collected during a real rainfall 
event. Performance comparisons between the traditional and 
ANN based object tracking algorithms are conducted based on 
the experimental data. Experimental results suggest the 
successful matching rate is significantly increased from 87.20% 
to 95.60% due to the usage of the ANN based algorithm. Hence, 
the improved disdrometer system is capable of producing more 
accurate and robust measurements of rainfall status."

164,Real-Time Image-Based Defect Inspection System of Internal Thread for Nut,"Abstract—The most important components of the internal
nut thread inspection process are measuring the pitch and
pitch diameter value and comparing these with their respec-
tive speciﬁcations, as a test nut is considered to be abnormal
when its pitch or pitch diameter does not meet speciﬁcations.
This paper focuses on defects arising when the pitch diameter
does not meet its speciﬁcation. Because conventional contact
strategies are not suited to the real-time inspection of internal
thread defects, there have been a number of recent attempts to
develop noncontact methods for real-time measurement. Some
approaches have applied laser triangulation techniques in which
reﬂected light is used to measure the z-axis depth on an object’s
surface. Although point lasers have been shown to be highly
precise in measuring pitch diameter, the optical architecture
involved in these approaches is complicated and, as the laser
must be scanned in a pointwise manner to derive cross-sectional
measurements, the measurement process is too long to be
compatible with real-time defect inspection. In this papere,
an image-based method employing a line laser projector was
used to develop a real-time image-based nut pitch diameter
defect inspection system. The proposed method, which improves
upon the conventional, widely used template-matching method
for rapid defect detection, was shown to be effective through
experimental validation."

164,Development of Wireless Smart Sensor System for Fish Image Observation,"Abstract-- The purpose of an observation platform is to send a 
real-time signal comprising information about oceans to an 
operation center. The observation platform is encased in a 
communication buoy. This article proposes a wireless smart 
sensor system for fish-image observation. The study used an 
image sensor to capture underwater fish images and a GPS 
module to receive position information. A 3G module was used 
for wireless transmission of the information. Moreover, an 
embedded system was used for power management to provide a 
stable power supply to maintain continual system operation. The 
proposed system can improve marine aquaculture and help in the 
monitoring of fish.

164,Photovoltaic energy harvesting in indoor environments,"Abstract—This paper presents a VI-Slope algorithm which can
track the maximum power point in the PV system. The proposed
algorithm (VI-Slope) avoids noisy measured power values in low
photovoltaic (PV) power conditions especially in in-door MPPT
environments by calculating the slopes of the voltage and the
current on the power supply path. VI-slop is implemented in a
low-power 8-bit microcontroller unit (MCU) and veriﬁed in an
indoor environment. The experimental results demonstrate that
the VI-slop algorithm can successfully track the MPP successfully
and increase the efﬁciency of the PV system by 16%.

164,Development of active displacement detector for slight vibration measurement,"Abstract—Vibration inspection is an important consideration 
in maintaining device stability and precision during system 
operation. Although many methods for vibration measurement 
have been presented, most of them focus on inspecting violent 
vibrations, whose displacement variations are larger than 
hundreds of micrometers. In this study, an active displacement 
detector is proposed for slight vibration measurement based on 
the astigmatic theory. The detector is composed of an 
astigmatic lens, an objective lens, a folding mirror, quarter 
wave plate, and a polarized beam splitter (PBS). An external 
control box controls the system’s power supply and signal 
communication between the detector and computer. Instead of 
traditional passive methods, an active laser beam behaves as a 
shape indication influenced by the surface deformation of a 
vibration target. A four-quadrant photodiode (QPD) detects 
the energy change ratio of a laser beam and translates the 
signal into the corresponding displacement. It was confirmed 
by experiment that the displacement detector was able to 
measure the patterns of different vibration models, including 
amplitude and frequency information. Even a slight vibration 
less than few micrometers could be measured successfully by 
the detector."

164,Application of Bluetooth low energy indoor positioning to optical lenses manufacturing factory,"Abstract—Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) provide physical 
location information of indoor targets (i.e., people or devices). 
Traditional optical lens manufacturing companies must enable the 
operator and customers to grasp the progress of optical lens 
production, a goal that the global manufacturing industry has 
been now pursuing. This study incorporates an IPS design into the 
manufacturing and processing procedures of optical lenses and 
uses an indoor positioning algorithm to calculate location-based 
information to achieve effective indoor positioning. Therefore, in 
this paper, this study proposes that using Bluetooth low energy 
sensors to perform signal strength fingerprinting identification 
can increase the accuracy of positioning. The results reveal that 
the proposed method can attain a certain level of accuracy in 
indoor positioning, and integrated into the optical lens production

164,High-Speed Image Velocimetry System for Rainfall Measurement,"ABSTRACT In this paper, a new image-based disdrometer is developed to survey the movement of free
falling raindrops. The proposed high-speed image velocimetry (HSIV) system comprises a high-speed
camera mounted on a lens with long depth of ﬁeld, a backlight source using an array of blue LEDs, and
a computation/control unit for image acquisition and analysis. Further image processing algorithms are
produced for raindrop detection and raindrop tracking. The performance of the HSIV system is compared
with that of a commercial PARSIVEL2 disdrometer during a local rainfall event within 12 h, while a tipping-
bucket rain gauge is also used to estimate the amount rainfall rate during that period. The data obtained from
the proposed HSIV system are in good agreement with those of PARSIVEL2. Furthermore, the results of
the HSIV system are closer than those of PARSIVEL2 to the actual rainfall, which is determined by the rain
gauge. To validate the raindrop tracking algorithm, another experiment is conducted to compare the tracking
results with the frame-by-frame visual observation from 2880 consecutive frames within 5 min. Experimental
results suggest that the proposed HSIV system facilitates the measurement of the precipitation properties,
fall velocity, equivolume diameter, raindrop concentration, and rainfall rate, to real-time monitoring of the
rainfall with stable and reliable analysis."

166,Multidiscip. Sci. J. (202 5) 7:e202 5085   ,"Abstract The work describes cloud and post-cloud computing paradigms, on the basis of which it is possible to model and 
build intelligent video surveillance systems. Based on the analysis of literary sources, it was concluded that performance 
indicators largely depend on the paradigm of the computational model, but the degree of importance of each performance 
indicator is different for different paradigms. Taking into account the peculiarities of different paradigms, the performance 
indicators characteristic of each of them are described. It has been found that the common indicators for evaluating all 
models developed on the basis of cloud and post-cloud computing paradigms (with varying degrees of importance) are: 
Throughput, Network Congestion, SLA Violation, Fault Tolerance, Statistical Analysis Measurements, The Number of 
Orchestration Decisions, The number of Contradictory Decisions, Time to Adaptation, Competition Ratio, Cache Hit Ratio, 
The number of Contradictory Actions, Oscillation Mitigation, Cost, Technique’s Overhead, Privacy. Based on the analysis of 
cloud and post-cloud computing simulators, it is established that the metrics of resource usage, energy, response time, and 
latency are those that can be used by researchers when conducting a comparative analysis of models built on the basis of 
the following paradigms: fog, edge, fog, and cloud computing. The practical significance of the conducted research is that, 
depending on the tasks that will be set before the future video surveillance system, researchers will be able to evaluate the 
effectiveness of using different architectures (Cloud, FOG, Mist, etc.) with the help of certain simulators. In the future, it is 
advisable to conduct a study of the degree of importance of common metrics for evaluating all models developed on the 
basis of cloud and post-cloud computing paradigms, and conduct their normalization for the possibility of conducting an 
adequate comparative analysis. It is also relevant in future research that it is advisable to conduct research using different 
types of sensor devices (surveillance cameras with different technical characteristics, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc.)."

Context. The probability of detecting the object by the operator of the video surveillance system depends on a number of 
parameters (geometric dimensions of the object of observation, distance to the object of observation, parameters of the video 
surveillance camera, monitor parameters, etc.). 
Objective. The purpose of the article is to develop an indicator of the effectiveness of detecting dynamic objects when evaluating 
the functioning of video surveillance systems. 
Method. An indicator of the effectiveness of object detection when evaluating the functioning of video surveillance systems is 
proposed. The proposed indicator is expressed in the probability of detection of the object of interest by the i-th operator thanks to the 
person’s own visual apparatus or with the help of a software algorithm. This indicator differs from the existing ones by taking into 
account the parameters of the optical system, the parameters of the information display device (monitor), the number of video 
surveillance cameras, etc. The developed indicator makes it possible to estimate the probability of detection of an object by a video 
surveillance system operator thanks to a person's own visual apparatus or with the help of a software algorithm, depending on the 
distance to such an object. 
Results. According to the results of experimental calculations, it has been proven that the effectiveness of the use of video 
surveillance systems with the use of video analytics functions (using the example of the dynamic object detection algorithm). 
Conclusions. The conducted experimental calculations confirmed the efficiency of the proposed mathematical apparatus and 
allow us to recommend it for use in practice when solving problems of evaluating the effectiveness of the functioning of video 
surveillance systems."
166,"22 Sciences of Europe  # 54, (2020) ","ABSTRACT 
In this paper we have analyzed modern approaches to the construction of intelligent video surveillance sys-
tems. We researched examples of construction such systems as CROMATICA, PRISMATICA, ADVISOR, 
CARETAKER, VANAHEIM, P5, ARGOS, SURVEIRON, IMSK, CONNEXIONs, VICTORIA, ЕWISA, 
SUBITO, SOBCAH, SAVASA, FORENSOR (developed under European patronage), Mind's Eye, DARPA 
ARGUS-IS (developed in the USA), as well as a number of commercial products Smart Surveillance System (S3) 
(developed by IBM), Kipod and Cephei (developed by Synesis), VOCORD Tahion (developed by VOCORD). 
The experience of domestic integrators was analyzed: TRASSIR, Bankomzviazok, ""Videokontrol-Rubizh"" from 
the company Оllie. 
As a result of the analysis, the expediency of creating an intelligent video surveillance system of the State 
Border Guard Service of Ukraine was proved. Based on the analysis of existing approaches to the design of intel-
ligent video surveillance systems, it is determined that there are no universal solutions and architectures of these 
systems for any scope of application. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the risks and threats to which the de-
partmental intelligent video surveillance system should respond and the methods by which such a system should 
provide analysis and signaling of the current situation. 
The expediency of creating an intelligent video surveillance system of the State Border Guard Service of 
Ukraine is based on the need for effective use of video surveillance systems at territorially distributed facilities, 
which have a special permit system and use certain regime rules. 
The direction of further research is the development of a conceptual model of the intelligent video surveillance 
system of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, determination of its role and functions in the Integrated 
Information and Telecommunication System ""Gart"".

166,Deep Learning Methods Application for Object Detection Tasks Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Abstract—Existing methods of detecting objects in the images 
obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles have been reviewed in the 
article. Emphasis was put on methods based on deep learning. A 
review of the most famous training datasets has also been 
conducted. The work was carried out in the focus of the main task 
of detecting small objects (people, vehicles). Application of task-
specific training datasets and implementation of multimodal 
approaches to data analysis in the future will allow to use deep 
learning methods in UAV monitoring."

Understanding videos of people speaking across international
borders is hard as audiences from different demographies do
not understand the language. Such speech videos are often
supplemented with language subtitles. However, these ham-
per the viewing experience as the attention is shared. Simple
audio dubbing in a different language makes the video appear
unnatural due to unsynchronized lip motion. In this paper, we
propose a system for automated cross-language lip synchro-
nization for re-dubbed videos. Our model generates superior
photorealistic lip-synchronization over original video in com-
parison to the current re-dubbing method. With the help of a
user-based study, we verify that our method is preferred over
unsynchronized videos."

168,MediAlly: A Provenance-Aware Remote Health Monitoring Middleware,"Abstract-This paper presents MediAlly, a middleware for 
supporting energy-efficient, long-term remote health monitor­
ing. Data is collected using physiological sensors and trans­
ported back to the middleware using a smart phone. The key 
to MediAlly's energy efficient operations lies in the adoption 
of an Activity Triggered Deep Monitoring (ATDM) paradigm, 
where data collection episodes are triggered only when the 
subject is determined to possess a specified context. MediAlly 
supports the on-demand collection of contextual provenance 
using a novel low-overhead provenance collection sub-system. 
The behaviour of this sub-system is configured using an 
application-defined context composition graph. The resulting 
provenance stream provides valuable insight while interpreting 
the 'episodic' sensor data streams. The paper also describes 
our prototype implementation of MediAlly using commercially 
available devices.

168,Power Efﬁcient and Low Latency MAC for,"Abstract— Existing protocols for medium access in Wireless
Sensor Networks opt for staggered wakeup scheduling among
clusters of nodes. However intra-cluster contention and interfer-
ence has remained an unaddressed issue. In this work we propose
PELLMAC: Power Efﬁcient and Low Latency MAC for Wireless
Sensor Networks, a schema that addresses node scheduling for
channel access. By limiting contention between adjacent branches
of the data gathering tree, we are able to reduce the latency of
the network, as well as optimize energy utilization. Simulation
results, in accordance with our claims, show that PELLMAC
enhances performance in energy savings, latency and delivery

services exposed by other things and service providers. A mashup
of such services extends the reach of the current Internet to
potentially resource constrained “Things”, constituting what is
being referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is ﬁnding

The concept of combined viral and bacterial vaccines has been tried in cattle, canine and humans. Use of multicomponent vaccines has 
numerous advantages over individual vaccine. In this study, apparently healthy 8-9 weeks old 41 puppies were divided into 2 groups. 31 
puppies (test group) were vaccinated subcutaneously with a commercially available multicomponent vaccine containing live attenuated 
strains of Canine Distemper virus, Canine Adenovirus type 2, Canine Parvo virus and Canine Parainfluenza virus and inactivated anti-
gens of Leptospira canicola and Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae. 10 puppies were kept unvaccinated (control). Test group puppies were 
given a booster after 4 weeks of primary vaccination. Serum samples from both the groups were collected on 4 occasions (0th, 28th,

bile solutions to increase the efﬁciency of their taskforce, but
this exercise is hindered by several functional and technical
challenges. For instance mobile devices are widely different
in terms of their underlying platform capabilities, available
screen real estate, input mechanisms and so on. In this work
we introduce mConnect, a Context aware real time Mobile
Transaction Middleware which manages this device diversity in
an efﬁcient manner. mConnect abstracts the complexities of the
mobile world from the existing infrastructure and seamlessly
helps in extending/ creating internet based transaction solutions
for mobile users with minimal or no modiﬁcation to the back-
end. This in turn accelerates the adoption of the mobile device
as a default channel to access the Web.

to alleviate the requirement of a large training data. In the
ﬁrst stage, we identify simple events such as sit, stand and walk
using three triaxial accelerometers. The second stage recognizes
a more complex activity using a Markov model that temporally
links the events classiﬁed in the ﬁrst stage. Experimental results

to a signiﬁcant loss in the latency of data delivery.In this
work we have introduced Low Latency Medium Access Control
(LLM), as a mechanism to deliver data with low latency without
compromising the energy efﬁciency of the network. To this end we
exploit the data aggregating properties of a sensor network and

ample opportunity to improve upon its promises of ﬂexibility and

they intrude into several facets of our life, bringing with it a

decreasing probability of the end user being a computer wizard,
it becomes necessary to isolate system complexity from the end

168,Mercury: A Wearable Sensor Network Platform for High-ﬁdelity,"Abstract
This paper describes Mercury, a wearable, wireless sen-
sor platform for motion analysis of patients being treated for
neuromotor disorders, such as Parkinson’s Disease, epilepsy,
and stroke.
In contrast to previous systems intended for
short-term use in a laboratory, Mercury is designed to sup-
port long-term, longitudinal data collection on patients in
hospital and home settings.
Patients wear up to 8 wire-
less nodes equipped with sensors for monitoring movement
and physiological conditions.
Individual nodes compute
high-level features from the raw signals, and a base station
performs data collection and tunes sensor node parameters
based on energy availability, radio link quality, and applica-
tion speciﬁc policies.
Mercury is designed to overcome the core challenges of
long battery lifetime and high data ﬁdelity for long-term
studies where patients wear sensors continuously 12 to 18
hours a day. This requires tuning sensor operation and data
transfers based on energy consumption of each node and pro-
cessing data under severe computational constraints. Mer-
cury provides a high-level programming interface that allows
a clinical researcher to rapidly build up different policies
for driving data collection and tuning sensor lifetime. We
present the Mercury architecture and a detailed evaluation of
two applications of the system for monitoring patients with
Parkinson’s Disease and epilepsy.

a remote monitoring system to monitor and detect simple motor
seizures. Using accelerometer-based kinematic sensors, data were
gathered from subjects undergoing medication titration at the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Over the course of the study, sub-
jects repeatedly performed a predeﬁned set of instrumental activ-
ities of daily living (iADLs). During the monitoring sessions, EEG
and video data were also recorded and provided the gold standard
for seizure detection. To distinguish seizure events from iADLs, we
developed a template matching algorithm. Considering the unique
signature of seizure events and the inherent temporal variabil-
ity of seizure types across subjects, we incorporated a customized
mass–spring template into the dynamic time warping algorithm.
We then ported this algorithm onto a commercially available inter-
net tablet and developed our body sensor network on the Mercury
platform. We designed several policies on this platform to compare
the tradeoffs between feature calculation, raw data transmission,
and battery lifetime. From a dataset of 21 seizures, the sensitivity
for our template matching algorithm was found to be 0.91 and

In this paper, we present the vision for an open, urban-scale wireless
networking testbed, called CitySense, with the goal of supporting
the development and evaluation of novel wireless systems that span
an entire city. CitySense is currently under development and will
consist of about 100 Linux-based embedded PCs outﬁtted with dual
802.11a/b/g radios and various sensors, mounted on buildings and
streetlights across the city of Cambridge. CitySense takes its cue
from citywide urban mesh networking projects, but will differ sub-
stantially in that nodes will be directly programmable by end users.
The goal of CitySense is explicitly not to provide public Internet ac-
cess, but rather to serve as a new kind of experimental apparatus for
urban-scale distributed systems and networking research efforts. In
this paper we motivate the need for CitySense and its potential to
support a host of new research and application developments. We
also outline the various engineering challenges of deploying such a
testbed as well as the research challenges that we face when building

in a dynamic MANET environment makes it almost impossible
to control the propagation of a broadcast packet in a controlled
fashion. Therefore, to offset the well documented inefficiencies of
a simple flooding mechanism, we propose Optimal Reliability
Broadcast Mechanism (ORBM). ORBM
is a received
signal
strength based scheme to control temporal congestion (arising out
of broadcast storms) and reducing rebroadcast redundancy. Our
main focus has been the prioritization of retransmissions from
nodes which cover maximum virgin territory. Moreover, ORBM
is topology adaptive, in the sense that there is higher rebroadcast
suppression in a dense neighborhood than in a sparse one. Our
simulations show that ORBM is highly scalable and practically
immune to neighbor density as well as mobility. The strength
of ORBM lies in the cost of a flood growing linearly with the
network diameter."
169,On use of traditional M/G/1 model for IEEE 802.11 DCF in unsaturated traffic conditions,"Abstract— For analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coor-

accepted is that every node always has at least one frame to
transmit. In practice, however, this assumption may or may
not be valid, particularly under unsaturated trafﬁc conditions.
In this paper, we assess the accuracy in using the traditional
M/G/1 queueing model for the DCF as an alternative model at
an individual node, and analyze its performance in unsaturated
trafﬁc conditions. Analytical and simulation results are compared
to demonstrate a reasonable accuracy of the proposed approach
for varying trafﬁc loads at an individual node.

169,Direction-of-transmission estimation in multiple-input single-output wireless communication systems,"Abstract— For transmit beamforming in cellular communica-

transmit beamforming at a base station is based on a stream
of simple beam-control commands (BCCs) from mobiles and
each mobile estimates its relative location in order to generate
BCCs. In this paper, for mobiles equipped only with a single-
element antenna, we present a least-squares (LS) estimator and
two neighboring set search (NSS) estimators for the direction-
of-transmission (DOT) of signals transmitted from the base
station equipped with a multiple-element antenna array. From
computer simulation, the performance of the proposed estimators
is evaluated in terms of root-mean-square (rms) error in degrees."

the potential for a substantial increase in capacity and power

posed transmit-beamforming based on beam-control commands
(BCCs) [1], [2] in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems, and
studies the effect of BCC errors on power efﬁciency, outage prob-
ability, and channel capacity. Numerical results show that even
with relatively high BCC error rates, the BCC-based transmit
beamforming substantially reduces the power consumption at the
basestation, and achieves smaller outage probability and higher
channel capacity than an omnidirectional antenna."
169,On explicit expressions of transfer function of OFDM systems in time-dispersive multipath channels,"Abstract— For
orthogonal
frequency-division
multiplexing
(OFDM) systems, the OFDM signals are typically designed
such that the guard interval is long enough compared to the
channel delay spread. In this case, the transfer function for each
subcarrier is a Fourier transform of the channel impulse response.
However, if the guard interval is shorter than the maximum
channel delay, it is not true any more, and intersymbol and
interchannel interferences from adjacent OFDM symbols and
subchannels must be taken into account. In this paper, we re-visit
the transfer function of two equivalent implementations of OFDM
systems operating in multipath channels with a generalized guard
interval, which could be shorter or longer than the maximum
channel delay, and evaluate the impact of interferences on the link
performance in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio.

169,Channel estimation with power-controlled pilot symbols and decision-directed reference symbols [OFDM systems],"Abstract—In this paper, a new channel estimation technique is 
presented that can improve the performance of channel 
estimation with fewer pilot symbols transmitted than what would 
be normally required in the conventional techniques. In the 
proposed technique, temporary estimates of CSI are initially 
obtained based on the transmitted pilot symbols and used to 
create additional decision-directed reference symbols (referred to 
as virtual pilots) with the least-square estimation technique. The 
proposed technique is differentiated from existing decision-
directed channel estimation techniques in that the blind decision 
process for data symbols is incorporated to increase the total 
number of pilot symbols, instead of directly using the decision-
directed CSI estimates. In order to enhance the quality of the 
demodulated data symbols that may be selected as virtual pilot 
symbols, transmit power control can be employed on the 
transmitted pilot symbols. From computer simulation, it is 
observed that the proposed method outperforms the conventional 
method and achieves about 3 dB gain for QPSK and more than 5

beamforming that operates without channel state information 
but based on beam-control commands in an analogous fashion 
to the well-known open-/closed-loop power control in cellular 
wireless communication systems. Simulation results show that 
the proposed operating principle is sufficiently effective in 
steering beam patterns toward multiple moving mobiles and 
also able to maintain the signal quality at a desired level

estimates the CFO in an iterative fashion based on the signals at

carrier frequency for the next iteration. It is found that with the

- In this paper we propose the use of the constant

simplicity. The convergence behavior of the CMA is analyzed 
to examine the conditions for lock onto the desired signal. 
Since the multiple access interference dominates the perfor- 
mance, especially in severe near-far situations, we pursue the 
noiseless case to facilitate a simpler analysis. Two forms of 
the CMA update equations are considered. The first one is 
standard gradient-descent based CMA. The second method, 
which we refer to as decorrelated CMA, employs the inverse 
of the channel correlation matrix to eliminate the effect of sig- 
nals' cross-correlations on the convergence behavior of the 
CMA.

Rayleigh fading environment. In particular, we evaluate the 
performance of a closed-loop power control scheme utilizing one 
power control command for all traf$c channels. Simulation results 
show that the use of one common power control command may not 
be optimal for all code-multiplexed channel signals of different data 
rates. This is largely due to the different variations in the effective bit 
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for a given fading 
rate in a multipath fhiing channel. With an observation of the 
performance improvement by more than I dB, we propose to use 
independent power control for each channel signal.

169,Channel estimation for high-speed packet-based OFDM communication systems,"Abstract 
In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (0FDM)-

for coherent demodulation of OFDM signals, particularly 
when modulated by multi-level modulation schemes. In this 
paper, we present a pilot-assisted decision-directed 
channel 
estimation 
technique suitable for packet 
transmission with relatively short OFDM symbols. 
Simulation has shown that our approach can save about 
20% of the number of pilot symbols required in the

fabricate MOS, and thus to achieve a selective metal oxide gas 
sensor in practice is very low.19 The developed system is intended 
for the detection of a specific VOC present in any aroma 
employing an aroma-specific coated quartz crystal microbalance 
(QCM) sensor.  
The QCM sensor consists of a quartz crystal sandwiched 
between two gold/silver electrodes. The oscillation of the QCM 
sensor and the temperature behavior depends on the cutting angle 
of the crystal substrate concerning the main crystallographic axis. 
When AC voltage is applied, the two faces oscillate against each 
other. At resonance, a wavelength of AC voltage exactly matches 
the plate thickness. The QCM sensors can be tailor-made for 
detecting specific volatile organic compounds (VOC) upon 
coating it with specific adsorbing coating materials.5,20 QCM 
sensors have been implemented for VOC detection of various 
agricultural products.21–25 During the sensing process, the change 
in resonant frequency (Δf) due to change in mass upon adsorption 
of VOC on the crystal surface is considered for sensitivity 
calculation. For small and rigid mass loadings on QCM, the shift 
in resonant frequency (Δf) is according to Sauerbrey’s equation26 
given by

Where fo is the fundamental resonance frequency, Δm is the 
mass deposited on the QCM surface, A is the active electrode 
area, ρq is the density of the crystal, µq is the shear modulus of the 
cut face of the crystal. For small mass loading Δm, the shift in 
resonant frequency Δf holds a linear relationship, and hence 
QCM sensor acts as a sensitive microbalance to detect small 
masses adsorbed on it 27. 
The present study focused on the development of a low-cost 
portable VOC detection system using the Arduino Due 
development board for data processing and data acquisition. The 
system is also equipped with an LCD Display for data output and 
an SD card for corresponding data storage. The working of the 
system was validated by evaluating the sensitivity of two 
fabricated sensors reported in the previous literatures.28,29 
SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
Basic block diagram of the developed system 
The working module typically consists of a sample delivery 
system, a detection system, a hardware module, and a software 
module. The sample delivery system generates the headspace 
(volatile compounds) of a sample. This headspace is injected into 
the sensor array of the electronic nose instrument. The sample 
delivery system maintains constant operating conditions. The 
detection system consists of a QCM sensor, that experiences a 
change of electrical properties, in contact with volatile 
compounds. The hardware module is responsible for all the 
necessary circuits for the power supply for the QCM oscillator, 
microcontroller units. The software module controls the 
operation of the hardware interface, along with the processing 
and storage of data. The data acquisition unit comprising Arduino 
Due development board controls the voltages for the operation of 
the delivery valves for sampling and purging phases and saves 
the frequency output from the sensor. The functional block 
diagram of the developed sensing system is shown in figure"
170,Untitled,"Abstract 
 
Cardamom is a well-known spice worldwide due to its flavour, aroma, various health benefits and 
culinary uses. Both large and small cardamom is considered costly spices and thus provide 
significant economic benefits in global trading. India is the leading producer of large cardamom 
and small cardamom globally and is the largest producer and exporter of small cardamom, 
significantly impacting the Indian spice industry. Because of the high demand for cardamom in 
the international market, the quality of the spice must be as high as possible, and proper analytical 
gradation of spices can result in improved export chances, consumer appeal, and financial benefit 
to the producers. However, there is a severe deficiency of appropriate post-harvest practices and 
quality evaluation of cardamom in India, where post-harvest production primarily relies on ancient 
procedures with little contemporary technological input. Since cardamom is highly aromatic, the 
volatile organic compound (VOCs) and semi-VOCs profile of spices are essential aspects of 
consumer’s perception and can be considered an appropriate benchmark to assess quality. Quartz 
crystal microbalance (QCM) is a valuable gas sensor detecting VOCs in multiple aromatic 
products. QCM sensors offer reliable, accurate time detection of VOCs because of their specificity, 
sensitivity, high accuracy, stability, and repeatability. This thesis reported VOCs of 24 (21 large; 
3 small) cardamoms samples using Solid Phase Micro Extraction guided Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) based analysis. Following this, four QCM sensors were prepared to 
detect the significant volatiles influencing the aroma of large and small cardamom, i.e., α-pinene, 
β-pinene, 1,8-cineole and α-terpinyl acetate. A portable instrument has been developed to 
identify the VOCs using QCM sensors. The system is comprised of an 8284A oscillation circuit, 
a Teensy 3.2-based counter module, and a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 7-inch touch display for data 
monitoring and control. A customized Python-based graphical user interface was designed to 
facilitate the recording and storing of sensor data. For the detection of β-pinene a QCM sensor 
was with the olive (OLV-QCM) oil to detect this marker VOC β-pinene, in Indian cardamom. 
The developed sensor shows high sensitivity towards β-pinene with a sensitivity of 0.3105 Hz/ 
ppm with R2 = 0.9979 for volatile concentration ranging between 10-1000 ppm. Furthermore, the 
sensor is adequately selective towards β-pinene in the presence of other dominant VOCs present 
in the cardamoms. The average reproducibility and repeatability of the OLV-QCM sensor have 
 
xi 
 
been calculated to be 93% and 95.14% within a 95% confidence interval. Similarly, QCM sensor 
coated with rice bran oil was developed for the detection of α-pinene. The sensor showed 
sensitivity measuring 0.367 Hz/ppm and having an R2 of 0.9976. Furthermore, even in the presence 
of other main VOCs present in cardamom, the sensor is adequately selective for α-pinene. Again, 
at 67.7 %RH, the developed sensor exhibits quick recovery, long-term stability, short-term 
stability, little humidity impact, and 95.91% average repeatability. Following that, a modified 
castor oil-coated QCM (phenolated phenyl ricinoleate by derivatization) sensor was 
developed to identify 1,8-cineole in cardamom. The designed sensor showed high sensitivity to 
1,8-cineole, as indicated by its sensitivity of 0.262 Hz/ppm and its R2 value of 0.9964. In addition, 
the sensor has acceptable selectivity for 1,8-cineole. The GC-MS was used for validation for 
twenty-one large cardamom samples, and the findings indicated a correlation of 0.98 with the 1,8-
cineole peak areas of the chromatogram. Moreover, a mathematical model has been formulated to 
predict the 1,8-cineole content from the samples using the developed sensor responses. The results 
showed an accuracy of 89.09% in predicting the 1,8-cineole content from the samples. Finally, 
molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based QCM gas sensor was fabricated to detect α-
terpinyl acetate in cardamom. The sensor shows high responsive towards aTA with sensitivity 
of 0.3876 Hz/ppm. The average repeatability and reproducibility of the sensor are obtained as 
94.72% and 93.76%, respectively. In all cases, structure and surface morphology of the sensor 
responses were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscope, Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and in each cases the sensor responses 
were tested with GCMS estimate of natural cardamom samples. Therefore, it is concluded that 
these developed QCM sensors which are user-friendly, portable and cost-effective can be used by 
gradual modification for quality assurance of large and small cardamom of our country in near 
future."

170,A Novel Real-time Collision Avoidance System for On-road Vehicles,"Abstract—With immeasurably increasing number of vehicles
on the road day by day, the number of deadly accidents that cause
signiﬁcant loss of lives, is also increasing. So, various researchers
have paid attention in the development of some road safety
application or accident avoidance system in order to minimize
such road fatalities. Among the existing road safety applications,
image-processing based techniques can perform well only if
vehicle is in line-of-sight with the camera and their performances
sufﬁciently worsen in hearse weather conditions like dense fog,
heavy rain etc. Thus, this paper focuses on the development of
a sensor based embedded system that can assist the drivers to
avoid any sort of collision on the road in order to save the
precious lives and also to prevent the ﬁnancial loss. The major
advantageous feature of our proposed collision avoidance system
is that it can estimate the collision probability and accordingly
suggest the corrective steps for the driver to avoid the collision
in real time. Moreover, our proposed system can be deployed on
any existing vehicle and does not necessitate deployment of any
extra infrastructure on the road side. Furthermore, the proposed
collision avoidance system is cost-efﬁcient since it consists of
various low-cost devices such as ultrasonic sensor node, speed
sensor, GPS, Wi-Fi module etc. The experimental results given in
this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed system
in real scenario."

β-Myrcene is a type of terpenes hydrocarbons commonly emitted in substantial amounts by plants such as mango. Using 
piezoelectric crystal, a sensor for detecting β-Myrcene volatile by using ethyl cellulose was fabricated. This fabrication of the 
sensing layer involves a nebulizer which actually vibrates the coating material 25MHz frequency becoming an aerosol. The 
sensor was found to be sensitive, selective and precise in order to detect the target analyte β-Myrcene aroma. The sensitivity of 
the sensor was 1Hz ppm maintaining a linearity of 0.999. The response of the prepared sensor was validated by real mango 
aroma which agrees the result obtained from the raw chemical constituents. By determining β-Myrcene volatile released during 
pre-matured until matured period, one could use this as a data point as potential non-destructive solution to discriminate the 
mango ripeness stage hence improving the quality of harvest.

171,A Microsecond Energy-Efficient LoRa Time Synchronization Based on Low-Layer Timestamping and Asymmetric Time Translation,"Abstract—High-precision time synchronization is chased by thriving
Long Range (LoRa) research due to its signiﬁcance for accurate monitoring,
detection, and network collaboration. Only a few LoRa time synchroniza-
tion methods could achieve microsecond-level accuracy, however, at the
expense of extensive synchronization message exchanges. In this article, we
propose a microsecond time synchronization for the LoRa network based
on low-layer timestamping and asymmetric time translation. Note that, the
proposed time synchronization does not induce synchronization message
transmissions at the LoRa end nodes, therefore, achieves high energy
efﬁciency. Experimental results on a real LoRa testbed demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves microsecond-level synchronization accuracy
with signiﬁcantly fewer synchronization message transmissions compared
to the state-of-the-art."

objects and their surrounding context. The model considers a
hierarchy of production equipment nodes and implements rules
for identifying and composing events in the production process.
The model is oriented to a graph database for collecting and
linking the evens in space and time dimensions. As a result,
efﬁcient search queries can be used to construct diagnostic and

172,Motor Activity Sensorics for mHealth Support of Human Resilience in Daily Life,"Abstract—The quality of life depends on the human resilience 
to stresses and other negative impacts from the environment and 
society. We assume that the human resilience can be effectively 
supported by motor activity. The problem is that people reduce 
the motor activity (the human mobility) although they are 
potentially able to move (the human motility). In this paper, we 
consider human motor activity sensorics and study the concept of 
mobile Health (mHealth) system to digitally support the mobility 
of a person during her/his daily life. The sensorics is based on 
inertial sensors of a smartphone that accompanies the person. 
The smartphone evaluates various motor tests for the human 
activity. The collected statistics provide an interesting picture to 
motivate the person to more activity. We introduce the concept 
model that interrelates human resilience and motor activity. We 
discuss possible digital support of human resilience based on 
testing the human activity. In sum, this study contributes our 
concept of smartphone-based mHealth system that digitally 
supports the motor activity of a person in daily life subject to 
increase the human resilience.

""The infinite diversity of external manifestations of cerebral activity can 
be reduced to a single phenomenon - muscular movement. Whether it’s the 
child laughing at the sight of a toy, or Garibaldi smiling when persecuted for 
excessive love for his native land, or a girl trembling at the first thought of 
love, or Newton creating universal laws and inscribing them on paper—the 
ultimate fact in all cases is muscular movement"".

172,An Event-Driven Approach to the Recognition Problem in Video Surveillance System Development,"Abstract—Many video surveillance systems (VSS) have been
already developed for various application domains. Such systems
are based on well-elaborated recognition algorithms of Artiﬁ-
cial Intelligence (AI) and implemented as Ambient Intelligence
(AmI) services in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. In
particular, algorithms support such smart VSS functions of
video data processing as human detection, human identiﬁcation,
object location within an image, human activity recognition.
Many software tools have been developed to implement various
recognition algorithms for VSS development. In this paper, we
consider the following VSS development problems: a) a generic
model of events in video data for a given problem domain,
b) a hardware–software architecture for data processing with
existing recognition algorithms, and c) a model to construct a
required smart VSS function using existing software tools. We
introduce our event-oriented approach to solve the above VSS
development problems. The approach is experienced in several
use cases. Our experimental study shows the applicability of the
proposed approach in terms of the accuracy and performance.

172,Case Study of Using Virtual and Augmented Reality in Industrial System Monitoring,"Abstract—An equipment monitoring system is responsible
for analytical services that assist the personnel in equipment
diagnostics, fault prediction, and post-analysis. In this work, we
consider a case study of using virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) for effective analytics delivery to the production equip-
ment personnel. The reference analytical services for our study
come from our pilot development with metalcutting industry in
Russia. The two service models are proposed: (a) Situation Center
and (b) Virtual Assistant. We identify the VR/AR advantages
compared with the traditional style of visualizing analytical
services on computer screens. Our study is supported with
prototype implementation of the VR/AR system for analytics
delivery to the personnel.

172,Internet of Things Education for MSc Study in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,"Abstract—The observed digitalization of society and economy
transforms the data from the following three “worlds” into
digital format: a) the information world (accumulated human
knowledge); b) the physical world (information from “things”
around people); c) the social world (society and human expertise).
Data fusion of these worlds is supported by the Internet of Things
(IoT) technology. In this paper, we present an adapted MSc study
program for students in Applied Mathematics and Computer
Science in Petrozavodsk State University. We show how practical
IoT problems become interesting research and development topics
for educating the MSc students. The proposed adaptation can be
further used for other basic MSc programs.

172,Trajectory Construction for Autonomous Robot Movement based on Sensed Physical Parameters and Video Data,"Abstract—Positioning of a robot in its autonomous movement
is applied to the automatic control and trajectory planning.
There are two types of systems: sensed data come from physical
parameters sensors and video cameras. In this paper, we consider
the integration of both data sources, providing a novel way for
trajectory construction. The sensed data are collected from the
IMU-sensor, camera, and Lidar. We present an architecture for
collecting data from many sources and for using the data to
evaluate the position of a mobile robot. The results of our early
experiments conﬁrm the feasibility of the data integration when
a robot moves between special points with different sequences
of actions. We also present an algorithm for the movement of
a mobile robot between given points without loss of positioning
accuracy at long distances. The accuracy is not only affected the
Euclidean coordinates, but the orientation angle is also improved.
As a result, a robot can be used in narrow indoor, where a special
point can be reached only at a certain orientation angle.

172,Smart Spaces Middleware: A Requirement-Oriented Overview,"Abstract—The progress of Internet of Things (IoT) leads
to appearance of diverse networked environments where speciﬁc
class of service-oriented applications—smart spaces—are becom-
ing developed and deployed. The deployment is based on certain
software platforms, widely accepted as smart spaces middleware.
This paper overviews this type of middleware with focus on the
requirements that the middleware supports in IoT environments.
We analyze and systemize the middleware requirements. The
systemized requirements are mapped to the particular existing
middleware solutions, leading to identiﬁcation and comparison of
basic approaches in the smart spaces development problem.

172,Intelligent Data Selection in Autonomous Robot Movement,"Abstract—Autonomous mobile robots have been discovering
recently a wide range of applications in various areas of human
activities. A robot uses many data sources (sensors) to recognize
its current situation, including video, inertial, acoustic, mechan-
ical stress. The data ﬂows from such sources are redundant,
error prone, delivered with a rather high rate, and contain
considerable information as for the ongoing events so present
measurement noise, errors and insigniﬁcant data about minor
ﬂuctuations of the environment and the device. They present a
source information for the inference modules such as navigation,
localization, path planning, scheduling etc. The total number of
the ongoing events can be large. They have different importance
for the movement control. In this paper, we consider a method for
intelligent data selection. The method is based on the Additive
Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm. The effect
is in ﬁltering the most signiﬁcant information to forward to the
robot movement control.

172,Random Backoff for Active Control of Information Updates in Smart Spaces,"Abstract—Performance ﬂuctuation on the semantic informa-
tion broker side due to critical growth of the request queue
length can cause its complete failure or substantial degradation
of its services.Since semantic broker is one of the key element of
the smart space architecture its performance is a vital issue for
the whole environment. We consider two possible sources of the
performance degradation.One of them is the growth of the request
arrival rate beyond the limits of its capacity. Another source
ﬁnds its origin in the request synchronization which happens
due to the presence of the regular patterns in the activities of
the smart space participants. Rather often implementation of
the relevant approaches at SIB size poses substantial difﬁculties.
We propose several algorithms that can be implemented on the
KPs side. The algorithms form an additional mechanism that
can reduce SIB fault rate and avoid performance degradation by
regulating the KPs activity and hence balancing the load of SIB.
The mechanism presumes additional timeout to the persistent
request. The timeout value is selected according to the current
system state and its history in the nearest past. The timeout
consists of two components. The ﬁrst one is determined be the
active control with the adaptive strategy and the second one is
deﬁned by the random backoff algorithm.

172,Ambient Intelligence Based Vision to At-Home Laboratory for Personalized Monitoring and Assessment of Motion-Cognitive State in Elderly,"Abstract—Humans loose functionality of many physiological
systems and, hence, the social adaptation, after the age of 60..65
years. The motor, cognitive, and circulation systems are the most
essential for personal social adaptation. The human brain adapts
to these age-related dysfunctions by means of natural reorga-

In this paper we review possible “external” interventions based
on the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technology. Interventions aim
at compensation for growing social de-adaptation of the elderly
that takes place due to cognitive and motor impairments. We
propose and discuss a novel concept of AmI-based “supplemen-
tary neocortex” (neo-neocortex) or “augmented intelligence” that
in a close-to-natural form would partly substitute declining own
cognition and mobility. We introduce our design vision of At-

172,Multi-Source Data Sensing in Mobile Personalized Healthcare Systems: Semantic Linking and Data Mining,"Abstract—The paper introduces an approach to collecting and
mining health-related information on the patient based on sensed
data from various medical devices as well as from other digitally-
enabled sources. The regularly sensed data are semantically
linked thus creating an additional information space—semantic
layer. On the latter, a linked knowledge-rich structure—semantic
network—is maintained and used to construct mobile services.
The use of various medical devices and other data sources
makes it possible to remotely monitor patients’ vital physiological
parameters and other important health-related events. It includes
sensing the context of the physical environment, which is then
coupled with the health state of the patient. Several patients
and interested people can be virtually integrated into a group.
Consequently, social methods can be used for enhancing the
treatment adherence and for motivating the healthcare goals. As
such, the healthcare services would have became more focused on
the patients and their needs. Ultimately, the mobile healthcare
moves towards the vision of At-Home Laboratory (AHL) that
diminishes the necessity to visit the hospital and to directly use
its facility.

ferring the data stream from a video capture device to some
powerful data processing center (e.g., cloud-based). In this paper,
we consider video services constructed in an edge-centric Internet

are available. Each data stream is subject to local processing
for event detection. Complex events can be also locally detected
based on the observed context situation in the IoT environment,
forming the semantics for video-analytics. We present a concept
model of an edge-centric service-oriented system and its event-

many participants are involved into the distributed computation.
In particular, many sensors continuously provide data, many
reasoners analyze the sensed data to construct services, and
many mobile clients regularly join and leave the smart space
to consume the services. The network interaction is information-
driven, using a semantic information broker, which implements
a passive strategy for subscription. The strategy leads to perfor-
mance bottleneck. We continue our study of the active control
strategy, when a part of subscription processing is delegated to
the subscribers. The client multiplicatively decreases its check
interval, if subscription notiﬁcations are lost, and additively
increases the interval, otherwise. We study the role of strategy
parameters: the client can select their values preliminary and
keep ﬁxed, or the client can change them dynamically depending
on the recent situation. With the aim we provide mathematical
model which represents important performance metrics as a
function of strategy parameters. Analytical result are validated
by experimental evaluation. Additionally, our simulation exper-

based on clinical samples from the ongoing TakeAim Leukemia trial. Methods: In Phase I/IIa of
the TakeAim Leukemia trial (NCT04278768), patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML or
high-risk MDS (hrMDS) received treatment with emavusertib monotherapy. Baseline and on
treatment patient samples underwent RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses. RNA-seq was
conducted on mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood (n=42). Plasma pro-
teins were quantified by the Luminex platform (n=51). Results: hrMDS patients responding to
emavusertib monotherapy exhibited decreased gene expression levels of the NFkB target gene
IL1b (P#0.05) compared to non-responders. Protein analyses revealed that hrMDS responders
had lower baseline levels of proliferation and migration-related factors, like Vascular Endo-
thelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A) and CXCL12, in plasma compared to non-responders (P#0.05).
In AML samples, baseline VEGF-A levels were significantly higher in responders. The con-
centration of soluble PD1 (sPD1) increased in on-treatment samples in hrMDS patients
(P#0.05), but not in AML patient samples. Additionally, hrMDS samples presented lower
IL2 and higher sCD47 levels compared to AML (P#0.05). Conclusions: In this work, several
baseline biomarkers indicative of a response to emavusertib were identified in patients with
hematological malignancies. Responders in hrMDS showed lower baseline expression of the
NFkB-associated pro-inflammatory gene, IL1b, and lower protein levels in plasma of the
angiogenic factor VEGF-A and the chemokine CXCL12. In AML samples, responders have higher
baseline levels of VEGF-A, indicating distinct predictive biomarkers for both pathologies. Other
molecules of clinical interest, such as sPD1, showed increased concentrations in on-treatment
plasma samples of hrMDS patients regardless of their response to emavusertib. Our findings
highlight distinct baseline biomarkers for AML and hrMDS related to the pathophysiology of
hematological malignancies. These results suggest that inflammatory and migration media-
tors, along with angiogenesis factors, hold potential as predictive biomarkers for assessing
responses to emavusertib monotherapy treatment in hematological malignancies. Clinical trial

technological marvel that heavily relies on the Controller Area
Network (CAN) bus system to enable seamless communication
among different electronic control units (ECUs). However, the
CAN bus system lacks security mechanisms for authentication
and authorization, leaving it vulnerable to various attacks.
Malicious actors can freely broadcast CAN messages without
protection, making the system susceptible to DoS, Fuzzing, and
Spoofing attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to devise methods to
safeguard modern vehicles from such threats. In this research
paper, we introduce HybridSecNet, A hybrid two-step LSTM-
CNN Model for Intrusion Detection, a deep learning-based
architecture specifically designed to bolster in-vehicle security on
Controller Area Networks (CAN). HybridSecNet comprises two
stages of classification: the first stage employs long short-term
memory (LSTM) to categorize input data as either normal or
attacked, and the second stage further classifies the attacks into
specific types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This
two-step approach significantly enhances classification accuracy
and reliability, yielding remarkable results with accuracy, preci-
sion, recall, and an F1-score of approximately 99.5% for CAN
bus network attacks. Comparative analyses with existing single-
step models underscore the superiority of our proposed model,
demonstrating its potential to revolutionize in-vehicle security in
the realm of modern intelligent vehicles."

beckons researchers to embark on explorations and investigations
in this nascent ﬁeld. Our review paper systematically synthesises
overtaking methodologies hinging on computer vision techniques
tailored for augmented intelligence autonomous driving scenarios
in response to this pressing need. Our analysis encompasses an
array of domains central to overtaking in augmented intelligence
AVs, encompassing Object Detection, Lane/Line Detection, Depth
Estimation, Obstacle Detection, Segmentation, and Pedestrian

established multimodal data sets. We assess different models’
performance across various parameters by employing graphical
structures, enabling visual comparative analyses. In object detec-
tion, YOLOv4 achieves a top performance with 0.90 mAP on the
BDD100K data set. For lane detection, CLRNET excels with the
highest F1 score of around 0.96 on the LLAMAS data set. ViT-
Adapter-L leads in segmentation tasks, boasting an impressive

175,AGD-Net: Attention-Guided Dense Inception U-Net for Single-Image Dehazing,"Abstract
Image hazing poses a significant challenge in various computer vision applications, degrading the visual quality and reduc-
ing the perceptual clarity of captured scenes. The proposed AGD-Net utilizes a U-Net style architecture with an Attention-
Guided Dense Inception encoder-decoder framework. Unlike existing methods that heavily rely on synthetic datasets which 
are based on CARLA simulation, our model is trained and evaluated exclusively on realistic data, enabling its effectiveness 
and reliability in practical scenarios. The key innovation of AGD-Net lies in its attention-guided mechanism, which empow-
ers the network to focus on crucial information within hazy images and effectively suppress artifacts during the dehazing 
process. The dense inception modules further advance the representation capabilities of the model, facilitating the extrac-
tion of intricate features from the input images. To assess the performance of AGD-Net, a detailed experimental analysis is 
conducted on four benchmark haze datasets. The results show that AGD-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 
methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Moreover, a visual comparison of the dehazing results further validates the superior 
performance gains achieved by AGD-Net over other methods. By leveraging realistic data exclusively, AGD-Net overcomes 
the limitations associated with synthetic datasets which are based on CARLA simulation, ensuring its adaptability and effec-
tiveness in real-world circumstances. The proposed AGD-Net offers a robust and reliable solution for single-image dehazing, 
presenting a significant advancement over existing methods."
175,A Novel Framework for Traffic Congestion Management at Intersections Using Federated Learning and Vertical Partitioning,"Abstract—Federated learning has shown exceptional usability
in diverse domains, such as IoT, healthcare, FinTech, Insurance
Sector and other Industries and Technologies. In numerous
emerging VANET applications, integrating federated learning
and vertically partitioned (VP) systems has yielded advanta-
geous outcomes. There is still much to discover in the ﬁeld of
trafﬁc management and intelligent mobility. The adaptation of
federated learning in ITS makes it safer, efﬁcient and enhances
vehicular mobility. The majority of federated learning techniques
for vertically partitioned data are synchronous in nature. The
development of asynchronous training algorithms for VP data is
crucial while maintaining the privacy of the data to increase efﬁ-
ciency. This paper presents a Privacy-Preserving Asynchronous
Federated Learning and Vertical partitioning based Algorithm
that reduces the duration of idling at red lights and improves
the fuel consumption of ITS. Additionally, we have introduced
a technique that enhances the passing-vehicle ratio at the

175,A Comprehensive Review on Limitations of Autonomous Driving and Its Impact on Accidents and Collisions,"ABSTRACT
The emergence of autonomous driving represents a pivotal milestone in the evolution of the
transportation system, integrating seamlessly into the daily lives of individuals due to its array of advantages
over conventional vehicles. However, self-driving cars pose numerous challenges contributing to accidents
and injuries annually. This paper aims to comprehensively examine the limitations inherent in autonomous
driving and their consequential impact on accidents and collisions. Using data from the DMV, NMVCCS,
and NHTSA, the paper reveals the key factors behind self-driving car accidents. It delves into prevalent
limitations faced by self-driving cars, encompassing issues like adverse weather conditions, susceptibility
to hacking, data security concerns, technological efﬁcacy, testing and validation intricacies, information
handling, and connectivity glitches. By meticulously analyzing reported accidents involving self-driving cars
during the period spanning 2019 to 2022, the research evaluates statistical data pertaining to fatalities and
injuries across diverse accident classiﬁcations. Additionally, the paper delves into the ethical and regulatory
dimensions associated with autonomous driving, accentuating the legal complexities that arise from accidents
involving self-driving vehicles. This review assists researchers and professionals by identifying current

175,Artificial Intelligence Enabled Vehicular,"Abstract
The recent advancements in the automotive and transportation industry have ush-
ered in a new era of travel, marked by increased safety and comfort for passengers.
These improvements have been made possible through the integration of technol-
ogy and sensors into vehicles.
This evolution from traditional automobiles to
the current generation of autonomous vehicles signifies the tremendous progress
in vehicle technology. In the past, human drivers were responsible for all tasks
related to driving, but today, we have semi-autonomous, less driver-dependent
vehicles that operate with minimum human intervention.
However, this integration of technology and sensors, while enhancing the capa-
bilities of vehicles, has introduced a new set of challenges. Modern vehicles are
equipped with a multitude of sensors and communication protocols, making them
susceptible to cyberattacks and security threats. Through these interconnected
channels, malicious actors can potentially gain control of a vehicle, leading to
malfunctions and, in the worst cases, accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. Such
attacks can disrupt the Vehicle Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) environment, posing
significant risks to passengers, drivers, pedestrians, and other vehicles sharing the
road.
In the contemporary automotive landscape, the deployment of Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS) stands as a pivotal advancement, reshaping vehicular
safety and functionality. Remarkably, within the expansive realm of one billion
global vehicles, a mere 10% are adorned with the sophisticated ADAS technology.
This statistic underscores the pervasive integration of ADAS, with approximately
100 million vehicles currently navigating the world’s thoroughfares equipped with
this cutting-edge technology. The ascendancy of ADAS to such a significant pro-
portion within the vehicular ecosystem heralds a transformative era in road safety
and underscores its substantive presence on a global scale. ADAS-enabled ve-
v
hicles are more prevalent on the road compared to fully autonomous vehicles.
ADAS, typically representing Level 2 automation, provides valuable driver assis-
tance and partial automation. In Level 2, vehicles can assume control of steering,
acceleration, and braking in specific situations, but it’s essential to emphasize that
driver supervision remains a critical requirement. Addressing the challenges asso-
ciated with ADAS technology and enhancing its capabilities is a fundamental step
before progressing to higher levels of vehicle automation, particularly considering
the widespread presence of ADAS-enabled vehicles on today’s roadways.
This thesis proposes Artificial Intelligence Enabled Vehicular Vision and Service
Provisioning for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), which takes on
the multifaceted issues that exist within ADAS-enabled vehicles, including secu-
rity vulnerabilities, improving perception in adverse weather conditions, and ad-
dressing driver inattention problems. The solutions and insights presented in this
thesis are designed to tackle these challenges and fortify ADAS technology, ulti-
mately working towards a future that is safer, more efficient, and better equipped
to meet the demands of modern transportation.

175,SCAN-GAN: Generative Adversarial Network Based Synthetic Data Generation Technique for Controller Area Network,"Abstract
In recent years, significant research has occurred on developing various protocols for communication within an autonomous vehicle. Due to 
the simplicity and trustworthiness of a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, it has become trendy and widely employed for in-vehicle communi-
cation. However, research indicates numerous network-level threats are possible owing to the CAN bus’s lack of defense mechanisms. Messag-
es are prone to attacks from third-party sources threatening the correctness of the CAN bus messages. In the last few years, machine learning 
and deep learning algorithms have effectively improved CAN security and developed various misbehavior, intrusion prevention, and detection 
systems. However, a large amount of data is required to train these algorithms. There are currently very few CAN datasets available, which has 
become a major barrier for researchers when developing new CAN security algorithms. Also, the nature of the data in question is tedious to 
accumulate, especially if there is a need for specific features. In this work, we proposed SCAN-GAN (Synthetic CAN), a generative adversarial 
Network (GAN) based technique to generate data using existing collected data and presented a synthetic CAN dataset. We also compared the 
original and generated dataset based on various parameters as well as on well-known classification algorithms, showing that various previous 
models deliver improved results on the generated dataset over the original dataset. The results exhibit the efficiency of using GANs for data 
production, which is on par with real data. The results of this work also suggest the adaptability of the GAN to work with varied datasets.

health
monitoring
(SHM)
plays a critical role in preserving and maintaining civil
structures such as bridges, roads, and monuments.
However, the current approach to SHM relies on
costly sensors and manual inspection, posing chal-
lenges in terms of efﬁciency and accuracy. In light
of advancements in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and
robotics, we propose an innovative solution for au-
tonomous structural health monitoring. Our approach
utilizes a specially designed robotic chassis and robotic
arm equipped with an infrared (IR) camera to assess
the quality of structures and detect cracks and defects.
By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we aim
to signiﬁcantly enhance the SHM process, making it
more efﬁcient and error-free. The key element of our
solution is an entirely in-house manufactured robot
that integrates a camera onto its robotic arm to
improve crack detection. By implementing computer
vision techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once),
we achieve precise and real-time crack detection,
enabling prompt notiﬁcations to relevant authorities
regarding any identiﬁed defects. This autonomous
robotic system optimizes the monitoring process and
reduces human intervention, making it a cost-effective
and reliable solution for ensuring the structural in-
tegrity of critical infrastructure."

175,Enabling Safe ITS: EEG-Based Microsleep Detection in VANETs,"Abstract—Researchers nowadays are particularly focusing on
the interpretation of EEG signals to understand and exploit
the information they provide for brain activities. Deep learning
architectures performing sleep staging have recently grown to
their full potential with their ability to learn and interpret highly
complex mathematical contexts. This has been catered to owing
to the increasing availability of large EEG data sets. In this paper,
we describe how sleep staging differs from microsleep prediction.
We also provide a fresh methodology for the microsleep classiﬁ-
cation job that works with even less training data. Our proposed
model exploits the attention-based mechanism that clubs the
advantages available in Wavelet transform with Short Time
Fourier Transform(STFT) Spectrogram. We also put forward
a robust deep learning model that contains separate “time-
dependent” and “time-independent” parts, which can record
contexts from the sequence of features and simultaneously
learn intra-epoch relations. A single-electrode EEG signal was
employed for our analysis to accommodate such procedures’
social acceptance. For the task of microsleep detection on the
MWT dataset, our model achieves fairly high accuracy rates
(92% training and 89.9% testing accuracy), and an overall
improvement in the kappa value by ≈42%, as compared to
prior novel approaches."

network availability and user authentication-based misbehaviors
without the need to train on them. Vehicular data is ﬁrst
sequenced and separated into three data branches - frequency
(F) derived from the message timestamps, pseudo-identities (I),
and the motion data (M) i.e. position and velocity. The proposed
model comprises of three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-
based reconstruction models trained to reconstruct normal F-I-M
vehicular behavior. The IDS classiﬁes each branch of a sequence
as 0/1 based on the reconstruction error threshold for the respec-
tive branch and, therefore, has the ability to detect 8 possible
binary encoded behaviors for each sequence of vehicular data.
These results are then used to ﬁnd the overall behavior of each
vehicle using carefully selected detection thresholds. MbRE is
able to classify frequency, identity and motion-based behavior
samples with an accuracy of 100%, 98.5-100%, and 95.4-100%,
respectively, without the need to train on such behaviors. The
study also emulates the IDS on Google Colaboratory and Jetson
Nano to show its practicality in cloud and edge environments."

1
challenging problem due to considerable variation in brightness
2
and varying contrast. Deep learning-based approaches have
3
recently demonstrated great promise in image enhancement.
4
Many existing neural networks used for image quality enhance-
5
ment ﬁrst encode the input into low-resolution representations
6
and then decode these representations back to a higher resolution
7
for the contextual information. However, this method leads to
8
the loss of semantic content. Recent research has demonstrated
9
the advantage of maintaining high-resolution information along
10
with lower resolution representations, which maintains image
11
features throughout the network. In this letter, we propose a
12
novel architecture named RNet for low-light image enhancement
13
of aerial images. The proposed network contains multiresolution
14
branches for better understanding of different levels of local and
15
global context through different streams. The performance of
16
RNet is evaluated on a recent synthetic dataset. We also present
17
a comprehensive evaluation with a representative set of state-of-
18

175,MbRE IDS: An AI and Edge Computing Empowered Framework for Securing Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Abstract—Recent years have seen a widespread
growth of research in the Internet of Things (IoT).
While mobility networks such as the Intelligent Trans-
portation Systems (ITS) are being increasingly studied
for their application in smart cities, there are nu-
merous cyber threats that may disrupt the security
and safety of the users of such networks. This study
proposes an intelligent, statistical Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) called Multi-branch Reconstruction Er-
ror (MbRE) for the long term security of ITS against
known and unknown threats. The proposed IDS learns
only from normal behavior, detects deviation of ve-
hicular from it, and classifies it into eight generalized
buckets based on the aspects of the data found to be
malicious, i.e. frequency, identity and motion (speed
and position). The results obtained show the success
of the proposed IDS in detecting different threats with
recall and accuracy scores between 97.5% to 100%
without the need to train on them."
176,Development of a Non-invasive Antenna Array for Non-Thermal Electroporation in Therapeutic Modality of Skin Tissue Tumors,"abstract proposes a more comprehensive approach of non-thermal non-invasive IRE of various skin 
tissue tumours using a wideband stacked patch topology with structural modifications for miniaturization 
designed in the intended frequency range from hundreds of MHz to few GHz. This wideband MSPA should 
be able to accommodate input pulse trains of sub-nanosecond/nanosecond (ns) pulsewidth needed for IRE. 
Furthermore, the proposed work investigates various non-spherical phase and amplitude tapers for 
wideband stacked MSPA in order to collimate the beam at the focal plane by averting spherical aberration 
effect. In addition, it includes array optimization to withstand high pulse voltages (~ tens of kV) that are 
essential for successful non-thermal permeabilization of cell membrane of the target tissue. A schematic of 
the proposed setup is shown in Fig."

lenging given the tight requirements for C-SWAP (cost, size,
weight and power) reduction while maintaining stringent electro-
magnetic performance specifications. While recent reports have
investigated developments in AI (primarily deep learning) to
address this challenge, such methods have limited capability
for multi-objective constrained inverse design and the ability
to handle large shape sets. We present a multi-objective an-
tenna synthesis methodology employing deep neural network
surrogate-driven evolutionary algorithm. Specifically, we propose
a branched-output convolutional neural network architecture for
creating the surrogate model and showing its ability to predict
multiple electromagnetic parameters over an operating frequency
range. The proposed methodology and its synthesis capabilities
are showcased by considering the set of polygonal-patch antennas
for operation in the 2 to 3 GHz spectral band. Specifically, we
report the design, fabrication and experimental characterization
of three polygon-shaped patch antennas, each fulfilling different
objectives, one being a single band with resonance at 2.45 GHz,
the second antenna is dual-band with resonance at 2.2 GHz and
2.9 GHz, and the third one being wide-band centered around
2.7 GHz. The reported methodology enables rapid synthesis (in
seconds), produces verifiable sound designs and is promising for
furthering data-driven design methodologies for electromagnetic
wave device synthesis."

176,In-House Experimental Demonstration of a Four-Port Antenna System and Wilkinson Power Combiner for Rectenna Applications in n78 Band,"Abstract—In this paper, we propose a subsystem for the
rectenna configuration in the n78 band (between 3.2 and 3.67
GHz). This subsystem includes an orthogonally arranged 4-
port antenna array and a 4-way Wilkinson power combiner.
The individual antenna element is a binomially tapered series-
fed 3-element patch sub-array with sidelobe level (SLL) less
than −20dB. The 4−port antenna configuration provides 360
degree beam coverage with a peak gain of 6.5 dBi at 3.55

The 4-way Wilkinson power combiner is specifically designed
at the n78 frequency band. It provides isolation between input
ports ranging from −15 to −20 dB and has an insertion loss
(IL) slightly greater than 6 dB. The proposed subsystem can
combine the received power at the antenna ports and feed
it to the rectifier input to generate a DC output voltage. A
simple in-house experimental demonstration of the combined
power output in the laboratory environment is provided with
the 4-port receiving antenna (Rx) being irradiated by multiple
ultrawideband (UWB) Vivaldi antennas having 8 dBi peak gain
each."

a frequency selective surface (FSS) based on surface integrated
waveguide (SIW) technique using exponential tapering. Here,
the unit cell of the FSS is an exponentially tapered cross-slot
structure designed on either side of a low-loss substrate. The FSS
exhibits good angular stability for TE and TM polarizations up

in the X-band region i.e., −3 dB transmission bandwidth from
8.69 GHz to 12.07 GHz, with low insertion loss of 0.1 dB
and sharp roll-off characteristics. Extensive studies on various
design parameters such as exponential tapering factor and via
dimensions are performed using HFSS full-wave EM solver. To
validate the proposed FSS design, a low-cost FR4 substrate is
used for fabrication, and the measured results are compared to
the corresponding simulation results."

polarised shared-radiator-based full-duplex antenna system.
Here, we initially show the signal impairment in the received

a conventional microstrip full-duplex antenna system without

176,Four-port Antenna Configuration in n78 5G Band for Energy Harvesting in Agricultural Sensors,"Abstract 
In this paper, the authors have proposed a compact 
orthogonally arranged 4-port antenna configuration 
comprising series connected 3-element patch sub-array on 
each face having dimensions L1×W1 (19.4 mm×22.32 mm) 
for Element1 and Element3 and L1×W2 (19.4 mm×26.32 
mm) for Element 2 designed on commercially available 
FR4 substrate (Hr =4.3, tan G =0.025). With respect to the 
center element (L1×W2), the sub array elements on its either 
side are equally and uniformly tapered so as to reduce the 
sidelobe level (SLL <-20dB) and the orthogonal 
arrangement of the 4-port configuration reduces mutual 
coupling (<- 40 dB). The antenna system is suitable to work 
in the n78 (3.2-3.67 GHz) C band 5G having peak gain of 
around 6.55 dBi and radiation efficiency of about 35% 
having azimuthal angular width of 800 at the operating 
frequency 3.5 GHz. The configuration can thus be used to 
attain a precise 3600 beam-steering aiding in energy 
harvesting for IoT based agricultural sensors."
176,Mushroom Unit Cell Loaded Triple Band Microstrip Antenna for Sub-6 GHz MIMO and Phased Array Application,"Abstract—In this paper, a mushroom unit-cell loaded multi-
band microstrip antenna sub-array is proposed. Here, the
mushroom unit-cell surrounded with a square slot is etched
out at the diagonal corner of the square patch antenna to
achieve multi-band response (3.21 GHz, 3.42 GHz, 3.68 GHz)
at sub-6 GHz frequency band. The proposed technique achieves
antenna miniaturization yielding a footprint of 0.19λ0×0.19λ0,
where λ0 is the free space wavelength at 3.21 GHz. Next, the
proposed antenna is used to conﬁgure 2 × 2 sub-array for
MIMO / phased array applications. The proposed sub-array
achieves satisfactory impedance matching of ≤−15 dB, inter-
port isolation of ≤25 dB, better SLL of ≤−20 dB, maximum
sub-array gain of 7.6 dBi, and 3 dB beam width of 590. Further,

digitally coded metasurfaces, which achieve anomalous reﬂection-
based beam steering. First, we demonstrate the systematic design
ﬂow of coded metasurface using phase gradient digital unit cells
to achieve anomalous reﬂection in the preferred direction for a
normally incident plane wave. Initially, the design procedure is
analytically implemented to get the phase proﬁles for 1-bit and 2-bit
digitally coded metasurfaces having equal sizes of 10λ0 × 10λ0
(where λ0 is the free space wavelength at 5.9 GHz) for a speciﬁc
reﬂection angle, (θr = 30◦, φr = 0◦), and subsequently, the far-
ﬁeld plots are generated. Furthermore, these phase proﬁles are used
to generate 3-D-CAD models of the 1-bit and 2-bit metasurfaces
using CST, and the desired far-ﬁeld patterns are obtained having
half-power beamwidth of 5◦. It is observed that the 1-bit coded
metasurface produces additional side-lobe levels, which are mini-
mized by use of 2-bit coding. Finally, the proposed 1-bit and 2-bit
coded metasurfaces are fabricated, and the anomalously reﬂected
far-ﬁeld beam is detected by the received power at desired reﬂection
angle and comparing the results with a perfect electric conductor.
The proposed design is suitable for vehicle to anything communi-
cations and can be scaled to other frequencies."

This paper proposes an eleven-element series-fed mi-
crostrip antenna array design with a low sidelobe level
(SLL) using modified tapering and wide azimuth field-of-
view (FoV) using parasitic array loading at 79 GHz for au-
tomotive short-range RADAR (SRR) application. Here, we
highlight the design limitation of conventional series-fed
antenna arrays with the binomial tapering approach to re-
duce the SLL at 79 GHz. The proposed modified tapering
approach provides 25 dB of SLL, nearly 800 azimuth FoV,
and 13.1 dBi peak gain. Further, the parasitic array loading
in the close vicinity of the proposed tapered array yields
68.75% improvement in azimuth FoV i.e., 1350 and 46.8%
improvement in impedance bandwidth with 22 dB SLL.

anomalous reflection. First, using 1-bit and 2-bit digitally coded
unit cells, we analytically model a programmable metasurface
in MATLAB for a reflected beam direction of θr = 30o,
ϕr = 0o, and perform the far-field radiation pattern analysis
for different aperture sizes. We observe the metasurface size
of 10λ0 × 10λ0 (where λ0 is the free-space wavelength at 10.5
GHz) provides anomalous reflection in the desired direction
having beamwidth of nearly 5o for both 1-bit and 2-bit coding.
We verify the reflection angle and half-power beamwidth
(HPBW) obtained from the analytical method with the full-
wave electromagnetic simulation using CST Microwave Studio.
It is also observed that the 2-bit coded metasurface having
10λ0 × 10λ0 size provides a far-field pattern with a reduced
sidelobe level (SLL) of nearly −1"

application in microwave ablation systems. Initially, a quarter wavelength long monopole antenna (Design1),
having length 30 mm (≈0.24λ0 where λ0 represents the free-space wavelength at 2.4 GHz operating
frequency) using series LC loading concept is designed. The initial design is further extended to a minia-
turized version (Design2) having length 5 mm (≈0.04λ0), showing nearly 83% size reduction compared
to its former.Both the antennas are designed and simulated by immersing inside high permittivity egg white

around the operating frequency with uniform monopolar radiation pattern having co-to-cross isolation of
nearly 30-35 dB. Further, the in-phantom Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values for both antennas are
evaluated using simulation and verified with the measured SAR values such as 22 W/kg and 19.6 W/kg
for Design1 and 2 respectively, using an in-house experimental setup. Moreover, the microwave ablation
property of the proposed antennas is studied using simulated transient thermal gradient which translates to
ablation zone formation. Here, Design 2 shows the advantage of having a low invasive diameter of"

scanning range using hairpin-shaped delay lines. The proposed
LWA has unit cells of H-shaped slots followed by hairpin-
shaped delay lines placed periodically. This configuration has
achieved CP along with frequency beam scanning. The hairpin-
shaped delay lines introduce group delay and leakage constant

176,A Co-Linearly Polarized Shared Radiator-Based Full-Duplex Antenna With High Tx-Rx Isolation Using vias and Stub Resonator,"Abstract—In this brief, a co-linearly polarized shared radia-
tor (SR) based in-band full-duplex (FD) microstrip antenna with
high Tx-Rx isolation is proposed. The Tx and Rx terminals of
the proposed FD antenna are designed on a single patch, where a
series of vias are loaded in the central line of the patch followed
by two L-shaped stubs at either end, which leads to high Tx-Rx
isolation (≈60 dB). The via loading makes the Tx and Rx anten-
nas individually operate in TM0,1/2 mode. The proposed SR-FD
antenna demonstrates Tx-Rx isolation of 60.8 dB at 5.9 GHz
operating frequency. Both Tx and Rx terminals of the FD antenna
exhibit identical radiation property with peak realized gain of
6.65 dBi and co-to-cross polarization isolation > 18 dB. The
working mechanism of the proposed FD antenna is explained by
both EM and circuit simulation, as well as veriﬁed with measure-
ments on the fabricated prototype. The proposed SR-FD antenna
has the merits of being planar, reduced footprint, simple feeding
mechanism, and desired isolation bandwidth for IEEE 802.11p

is fundamental to use sustainable technologies in this field. With this in mind, some statistical data
are analyzed regarding the food price rise and sustainable development indicators, with a special
focus on the Portugal region. It is determined that one of the main factors that influences agriculture’s
success is the soil’s characteristics, namely in terms of moisture and nutrients. In this regard, irrigation
processes have become indispensable, and their technological management brings countless economic
advantages. Like other branches of agriculture, the wine sector needs an adequate concentration of
nutrients and moisture in the soil to provide the most efficient results, considering the appropriate

with the option of using lithium rechargeable batteries and
supercapacitors as an Energy Storage System (ESS). Several

producers of these gadgets, different kinds of protocols, and diverse environments. The lack of
interoperability reduces comfort of the user and turns into a barrier to smart home adoption. Matter
is growing by constructing an open-source application layer protocol that can be compatible with
all smart home ecosystems. In this article, a Matter overview is provided (namely, of the Commis-
sioning stage), and a Matter Accessory using ESP32-S3 is developed referring to the manufacturer’s
SDKs and is inserted into an existent household ecosystem. Its behavior on the network is briefly
analyzed, and interactions with the device are carried out. The simplicity of these tasks demonstrates
accessibility for developers to create products, especially when it comes to firmware. Additionally,
device commissioning and control are straightforward for the consumer. This capacity of gadget
incorporation into diverse ecosystems using Matter is already on the market and might result in

Objective: The purpose of this paper is to present a case study on how a recently 
proposed reproducibility framework named Environment Code-First (ECF) based on 
the Infrastructure-as-Code approach can improve the implementation and 
reproduction of computing environments by reducing complexity and manual 
intervention. 
 
Methodology: The study compares the manual way of implementing a pipeline and 
the automated method proposed by the ECF framework, showing real metrics 
regarding time consumption, efforts, manual intervention, and platform agnosticism. 
It details the steps needed to implement the computational environment of a 
bioinformatics pipeline named MetaWorks from the perspective of the scientist who 
owns the research work. Also, we present the steps taken to recreate the environment 
from the point of view of one who wants to reproduce the published results of a 
research work. 
 
Findings and Conclusion: The results demonstrate considerable benefits in adopting 
the ECF framework, particularly in maintaining the same applicational behavior 
across different machines. Such empirical evidence underscores the significance of 
reducing manual intervention, as it ensures the consistent recreation of the 
environment as many times as needed, especially by non-original researchers. 
 
Originality/Value: Verifying published findings in bioinformatics through 
independent validation is challenging, mainly when accounting for differences in 
software and hardware to recreate computational environments. Reproducing a 
computational environment that closely mimics the original proves intricate and 
demands a significant investment of time. This study contributes to educate and assist 
researchers in enhancing the reproducibility of their work by creating self-contained 
computational environments that are highly reproducible, isolated, portable, and 
platform-agnostic.

rience (QoE), grounded in incorporating massive broad-bandwidth machine-type (mBBMT), mo-
bile broad-bandwidth and low-latency (MBBLL), and massive low-latency machine-type (mLLMT)
communications. In attaining its objectives, 6G faces challenges that demand inventive solutions,
incorporating AI, softwarization, cloudiﬁcation, virtualization, and slicing features. Technologies
like network function virtualization (NFV), network slicing, and software-deﬁned networking (SDN)
play pivotal roles in this integration, which facilitates efﬁcient resource utilization, responsive service
provisioning, expanded coverage, enhanced network reliability, increased capacity, densiﬁcation,
heightened availability, safety, security, and reduced energy consumption. It presents innovative
network infrastructure concepts, such as resource-as-a-service (RaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service
(IaaS), featuring management and service orchestration mechanisms. This includes nomadic net-
works, AI-aware networking strategies, and dynamic management of diverse network resources.
This paper provides an in-depth survey of the wireless evolution leading to 6G networks, addressing
future issues and challenges associated with 6G technology to support V2X environments consid-
ering presenting +challenges in architecture, spectrum, air interface, reliability, availability, density,
ﬂexibility, mobility, and security."
177,Software and Architecture Orchestration for Process Control in Industry 4.0 Enabled by Cyber-Physical Systems Technologies,"Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, this paper explores the vital role of advanced technologies,
including Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins, and Ar-
tificial Intelligence (AI), in enhancing data valorization and management within industries. These
technologies are integral to addressing the challenges of producing highly customized products in
mass, necessitating the complete digitization and integration of information technology (IT) and oper-
ational technology (OT) for flexible and automated manufacturing processes. The paper emphasizes
the importance of interoperability through Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), Manufacturing-as-
a-Service (MaaS), and Resource-as-a-Service (RaaS) to achieve seamless integration across systems,
which is critical for the Industry 4.0 vision of a fully interconnected, autonomous industry. Further-
more, it discusses the evolution towards Supply Chain 4.0, highlighting the need for Transportation
Management Systems (TMS) enhanced by GPS and real-time data for efficient logistics. A guideline
for implementing CPS within Industry 4.0 environments is provided, focusing on a case study of
real-time data acquisition from logistics vehicles using CPS devices. The study proposes a CPS
architecture and a generic platform for asset tracking to address integration challenges efficiently
and facilitate the easy incorporation of new components and applications. Preliminary tests indicate
the platform’s real-time performance is satisfactory, with negligible delay under test conditions,
showcasing its potential for logistics applications and beyond."
177,Integration of a V2G charging station in a smart Prosumer household via a cloud-based energy management system considering ToU tariffs,"Abstract— Bidirectional electric vehicle charging stations 
(EVSE) offer new business models for private users and 
companies such as Demand Response. Even if first standards for 
smart charging (ISO 15118, OCPP) are established, no 
commercial turnkey solution for the integration of a vehicle to 
grid (V2G) charging station into a smart prosumer household 
exists yet. This study shows a possible concept for the integration 
of a V2G charger for a vehicle to home (V2H) use case. A smart 
controller for a prosumer household is developed allowing the 
interconnection of different types of electrical equipment like a 
V2G charger, a photovoltaic system for electricity generation, a 
heat pump for heating. Therefore, different interfaces such as 
Modbus TCP, Modbus RTU, OCPP, HTTP are used. An 
algorithm is developed to charge the vehicle at low electricity 
prices or at times of overproduction of the PV system respective 
to discharge the car at high electricity prices or times of no PV 
production. The modular concept allows realizing the solution 
as a cloud-based service which can be applied to energy 
communities."

Abstract— Nowadays, computational resources are vital 
practically in all areas of science. At the same time, science's 
dependence on computing is pointed to by experts as one of the 
main causes of the reproducibility crisis. Many factors have 
contributed to the low reproducibility of scientific research. 
They are related to the cultural aspects of the scientific 
software's development, the behavior of the scientist-developer, 
and technical issues. Based on these factors, the authors 
presented the Environment Code-First (ECF) framework to 
guide researchers on increasing the reproducibility of their 
works by developing computational environments that can be 
easily 
recreated 
without 
manual 
intervention. 
The 
framework's 
foundation 
is 
the 
Infrastructure-as-Code 
approach, and it intends to permit other researchers to 
recreate an environment only by executing a script. A real case 
is presented, demonstrating the provision of a bioinformatics 
environment by using the Prokaryotic Genomics and 
Comparative Genomics Analysis Pipeline (PGCGAP) protocol, 
and the ECF framework. The paper shows a comparison 
between these two methods in terms of time-consumption, 
manual intervention, platform-agnosticism, and portability. 
The tests perfomed on three different machines demonstrated 
that there are many benefits on using the ECF framework such 
as independency of platform, total portability, and practically 
any manual intervention. Of course, there is a cost, and it is 
related to the hard work on developing the code that generates 
the environment. Another point that needs to be highlighted is 
the time spent and efforts on achieving the necessary 
knowledge to create those programs."
177,Progress in Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract. In many college courses in several countries are used exams
in a national scale, such as Gaokao, in China, Scholastic Aptitude Test
- SAT and the American College Testing - ACT in the United States of
American, Y¨uksek¨ogretime Gec.is Sinavi – YGS in Turkey, among others.
This paper examines microdata from the High School National Examina-
tion (ENEM) database from Brazil. The database has 8,627,367 records,
166 attributes, and all experiments were performed based on the Spark
architecture. The objective of this work is to examine microdata of the
ENEM database applying data mining algorithms and creating an app-
roach to handle big data and to predict the proﬁle of those enrolled in
ENEM. Through the standards found by the data mining algorithms with
classiﬁcation algorithms, it was possible to observe that family income,
access to information, profession, and academic history of the parents
were directly related to the performance of the candidates. And with a
rules induction algorithm, it was possible to identify the patterns pre-
sented in each of the regions of Brazil, such as common characteristics
when a candidate was approved and when not, essential factors as dis-
ciplines and particular characteristics of each region. This approach also
enables the execution of large volumes of data in a simpliﬁed computa-
tional structure."
177,Adaptation and Validation of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire to Portuguese (SSQp) Based on Immersive Virtual Reality Exposure,"ABSTRACT Cybersickness refers to the negative symptoms caused by exposure to a Virtual Reality (VR)
experience. The literature is consensual that cybersickness is a key factor in an experience, as the non-
existence of cybersickness provides an optimal virtual experience. Thus, it is of utmost importance to evaluate
cybersickness when assessing VR applications to understand the impact of this factor on the user experience
and, ultimately, on the VR application viability. However, there is a lack of Portuguese instruments to evaluate
this variable. To tackle this, this aimed to translate and validate the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)
to Portuguese so it can be used with the Portuguese population and maintain its psychometric properties. The
new instrument was validated using a sample of 603 Portuguese subjects aged between 16 and 79. Based on
the observed results, the obtained theoretical model shows that the Portuguese version of the SSQ is valid
for properly evaluating cybersickness in VR experiences with Portuguese samples."
177,"Enhancing Network Slicing Security: Machine Learning, Software-Defined Networking, and Network Functions Virtualization-Driven Strategies","Abstract: The rapid development of 5G networks and the anticipation of 6G technologies have
ushered in an era of highly customizable network environments facilitated by the innovative concept
of network slicing. This technology allows the creation of multiple virtual networks on the same
physical infrastructure, each optimized for specific service requirements. Despite its numerous
benefits, network slicing introduces significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed to
prevent exploitation by increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This review explores the applica-
tion of cutting-edge technologies—Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML),
Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)—in crafting ad-
vanced security solutions tailored for network slicing. AI’s predictive threat detection and automated
response capabilities are analysed, highlighting its role in maintaining service integrity and resilience.
Meanwhile, SDN and NFV are scrutinized for their ability to enforce flexible security policies and
manage network functionalities dynamically, thereby enhancing the adaptability of security measures
to meet evolving network demands. Thoroughly examining the current literature and industry
practices, this paper identifies critical research gaps in security frameworks and proposes innovative
solutions. We advocate for a holistic security strategy integrating ML, SDN, and NFV to enhance
data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across network slices. The paper concludes with
future research directions to develop robust, scalable, and efficient security frameworks capable of
supporting the safe deployment of network slicing in next-generation networks."
178,Demo: Enhancing Wireless Connectivity in Skip Zones via Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface,"ABSTRACT
The efficacy of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided net-
work for enhanced connectivity in skip zones is demonstrated
through real-time video streaming. The demonstration is carried
out with the help of National Instruments universal software radio
peripheral (NI-USRP) devices integrated with an RIS prototype. The
RIS prototype is designed and fabricated using a 16×10 metasur-
face operating at 5.3 GHz carrier frequency. Utilizing LabVIEW’s
long-term evolution (LTE) application framework module, good
connectivity between the transmitter and receiver in an otherwise
skip zone is exhibited. Various modulation and coding schemes
have been applied to the streamed data to observe the throughput,
SINR, and constellation diagrams with respect to different posi-
tions of the receiver in the non-line of sight (NLOS) skip zone.
The demonstration ratifies the potential of RIS system in practical
applications related to future wireless communications."
178,Mitigation of Metal Body Proximity Effect in Magnetically Coupled HF RFID Systems,"Abstract—The deleterious effect of eddy current due to the
presence of a metal in magnetically coupled resonant high-
frequency radio frequency identiﬁcation (HF RFID) systems is
addressed, and remediation using a resonant loop is discussed.
The proposed solution is much more economic than conventional

illustrated through applications like HF RFID tags in close
proximity to a metal seal required for induction sealing, as well
for extending read range of readers compelled to operate near

178,Waveguide-Floquet Mapping Using Surface Susceptibilities for Passive and Active Metasurface Unit Cell Characterization,"Abstract—A simple waveguide-Floquet mapping is proposed
and theoretically investigated that links the scattering response
of a sub-wavelength metasurface unit cell under an infinite
periodic array configuration and when measured inside a shielded
rectangular waveguide environment. This mapping is based on
extracting the effective surface susceptibilities as the funda-
mental constitutive parameters of the cells, via the Generalized
Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) of the unit cell using the
waveguide measurements, and then reconstructing the unit cell
response at an arbitrary incidence angles. Using two examples
of a transmissive Huygens’ metasurface and a purely reflective
metasurface, the proposed waveguide-Floquet mapping is numer-
ically confirmed to determine the complete angular scattering of
the unit cells. The proposed waveguide-Floquet mapping thus
represents a simple technique to experimentally determine the
angular scattering characteristics of the unit cell using a low-
cost effective waveguide measurements."
178,Reconfigurable Metasurface Reflectors Using Split-Ring Resonators with Co-Designed Biasing for Magnitude/Phase Control,"Abstract—A novel reconfigurable metasurface reflector with a
simple architecture is proposed based on either PIN or varactor
diodes for magnitude and phase control, respectively. Each
metasurface reflector is based on a single-dielectric two-metal-
layer printed-circuit board (PCB), with a tunable resonator on
the top metal layer and biasing on the bottom metal layer.
The metasurface reflectors are designed for reconfigurability
on a column-by-column basis (i.e., single-plane beamforming).
Biasing is integrated in the design of the unit cell and RF-DC
isolation is implemented at the ends of each reflector column.
The bias lines are designed to have minimal effect on the
resonator characteristics, while appropriate architectures are
devised for each configuration involving PIN or varactor diodes.
To demonstrate various functionalities of the metasurfaces, the
PIN-based metasurface reflector is used to demonstrate mag-
nitude control, side-lobe level control, and binary amplitude
grating to generate three symmetrical beams. The varactor-based
metasurface reflector is used to demonstrate single beam-steering
and binary phase grating to generate two symmetrical beams."
178,A 1-Bit Coding Reconfigurable Metasurface Reflector for Millimeter Wave Communications in E-Band,"Abstract—In this paper, a millimeter wave (mmWave) 1-
bit coding metasurface is presented. The unit cell of the
metasurface consists of a modified dipole loaded with a Macom
MA4AGFCP910 PIN diode, which works quite satisfactorily at
E-band mmWave. The unit cell provides a 180°±30° reflection
phase difference between its ON and OFF states for a broad
frequency range from 74-84 GHz (12.65 %). Despite being a
PCB-based design at E-band, the unit cell provides maximum
reflection loss of only 2.7 dB. Using such unit cell, an array
of 30×15 elements is constructed with column-by-column
arrangement of biasing for the PIN diodes to achieve 1-D beam
steering. Furthermore, the RF is isolated from the DC on the
bias lines using properly designed radial stubs. The theoret-
ically calculated and full-wave simulated results of radiation
patterns show good agreement with each other. The effect of
beam squint and scan loss from the proposed broadband 1-bit
coding metasurface is critically investigated. The design can
find application in different mmWave communications in E-
band."
178,Coupled Resonator-Based Metasurface Reflector With Enhanced Magnitude and Phase Coverage,"Abstract— A metasurface reflector unit cell is proposed for
achieving a near-complete range of complex reflectance (i.e., mag-
nitude and phase) for versatile beamforming capabilities. The
unit cell is based on tunable coplanar coupled resonators:
a split ring resonator (SRR) with a lumped capacitor and
a lumped resistor, and a dipole ring resonator (DRR) with
another lumped capacitor. The DRR inserted inside the SRR
creates a coupled resonance configuration that results in an
enhanced complex reflectance range at the desired frequency.
To provide physical insight and explain the operation principle of
the structure, the response of the unit cell is modeled as a coupled
Lorentz oscillator via the effective surface susceptibilities, where
a unique plasma frequency, damping coefficient, and resonant
frequency can be attributed to each resonator. The proposed
unit cell is demonstrated in an array configuration for linear-
polarized beamforming, where full-wave simulations are used to
demonstrate beam-steering, gain control, sidelobe level control,
and dual- and triple-beam generation, as illustrative examples.
Finally, experimental demonstration is performed to validate the
full-wave results and obtain in-depth electrical characterization
of the reflectors."
178,Waveguide-Floquet Mapping Based on Surface Susceptibilities for Metasurface Unit Cell Characterization,"Abstract
A simple method is proposed to characterize metasurface
unit cells using rectangular waveguide. The method maps
the S-parameters obtained using a dominant-mode waveg-
uide to the S-parameters of fundamental Floquet mode for a
plane wave incident at any desired angle. The mapping be-
tween the dominant waveguide mode and the fundamental
Floquet mode is executed by extracting the equivalent sur-
face susceptibilities of the metasurface unit cell. The results
obtained from the proposed method show good agreement
with the full-wave simulation results of the metasurface unit
cell.

178,Dynamic Metasurface Reflectors Based on Coupled Resonators for Simultaneous Magnitude and Phase Control,"ABSTRACT A novel metasurface reflector unit cell based on two coupled resonators is proposed and
demonstrated for real-time reconfigurable beamforming in the X-band (8-12 GHz). The unit cell is composed
of a split-ring resonator (SRR) with tunable capacitance and a dipole-ring resonator (DRR) with tunable
resistance, whose collective variations allow for control over the complex reflectance at a desired frequency.
To gain physical insight into its working mechanism, the proposed unit cell is modeled as a coupled Lorentz
oscillator using the surface susceptibility description of the unit cell. Thereafter, a metasurface reflector
based on the proposed unit cell is demonstrated in full-wave simulations to achieve various beamforming
examples, such as beam-steering, side-lobe level control, beam-steering with amplitude control, and multi-
beam patterns, from a single normally-incident plane wave excitation. Three metasurface reflectors are
fabricated to experimentally demonstrate the proposed concept; the first is based on an SRR with a varactor
diode, the second is based on a DRR with a PIN diode, and the third is based on the proposed coupled SRR-
DRR configuration with both varactor and PIN diodes, for simultaneous magnitude and phase control. The
metasurface reflector based on the coupled resonator unit cell is experimentally demonstrated to achieve
versatile beam transformations including beam-steering with amplitude control and multi-beam patterns."
178,A 1-Bit Coding Reconfigurable Metasurface Reflector for Circularly Polarized Wave Beam Steering from Linearly Polarized Incidence,"Abstract
A 1-bit reconfigurable metasurface reflector is designed. It
can provide beam-steering of circularly polarized (CP) re-
flected waves when a linearly polarized (LP) plane wave is
incident upon it. The unit cell of the metasurface provides
1-bit coding (‘bit-0’ and ‘bit-1’) for both v- and u-polarized
reflected waves when two distinct reverse bias voltages (3
V and 20 V) are applied to the varactor diodes. Using such
unit elements, a 20×20 array is constructed. During the
array construction, a quadrature phase difference is main-
tained between the v- and u- polarized components of each
element. Using both theory and full-wave simulation re-
sults, it is shown that the proposed metasurface reflectarray
can steer two symmetrically deflected CP beams with two
opposite handedness for a LP plane wave incidence.

178,Coupled Resonator Configuration for Enhanced Reflectarray Magnitude and Phase Control,"Abstract—A reﬂectarray metasurface unit cell consisting of
two coupled resonators and three variable controls is proposed.
The conﬁguration consists of an outer split-ring resonator (SRR)
responsible for resonance at the desired frequency and includes
two variable elements; one capacitive and one resistive. A dipole-
ring resonator (DRR) is inserted inside the SRR with a capacitive
element, creating a resonance at a higher frequency than the
SRR. Variation of the DRR resonance affects both the magnitude
and the phase of the lower resonance of the SRR. For any given
constraint on the available capacitive or resistive values, the
coupled resonator conﬁguration provides a signiﬁcantly enhanced
reﬂection magnitude and phase variations compared to a single
isolated resonator. Control over magnitude and phase is used
to demonstrate four cases of beamforming in the X-band at
9 GHz: side-lobe level (SLL) reduction, beam-steering, beam-
steering with SLL reduction, and dual-beam generation.

This paper presents a review of frequency selective surface (FSS)-based electromagnetic 
absorbers with an insight into their operational principles. Various techniques commonly 
used to design and develop FSS-based absorbers for several vital metrics are discussed 
to assess their efficacies and highlight the benefits and limitations of each solution. The 
absorbers are discussed in light of their major attributes, starting from their evolution to 
the state-of-the-art. It includes the most popular configurations of FSS-based absorbers-
single/multilayer, radar absorbing material, metamaterial, to more recently used active 
and conformal absorbers. These absorbers can provide absorption bandwidth in both nar-
rowband and wideband frequencies, which find numerous applications throughout the fre-
quency spectrum, ranging from the VHF range to visible light. Some important aspects of 
the absorber’s performance have been highlighted. It includes minimum possible thickness 
for maximum achievable bandwidth, polarization stability, oblique angle insensitivity, and 
mitigation of cross-polarized reflection required to design an efficient absorber. Moreo-
ver, some of the most popular manufacturing and measurement techniques of FSS-based 
absorbers are discussed before concluding with some future aspects. In the conclusion, the 
need for economical electromagnetic absorbers to achieve good absorption performances 
over a wide range of frequencies is justified. The approaches presented in this article offer a 
broader view of capabilities and forthcoming developments in this crucial area."
178,A Low-RCS Circularly Polarized Reflectarray Antenna With a Linearly Polarized Feed,"Abstract— A low-radar cross section (RCS) circularly polar-
ized (CP) reflectarray antenna with a linearly polarized (LP) feed
is designed. The out-of-band RCS of the reflectarray for both the
TE and TM polarized incident waves is reduced by replacing its
ground with an absorptive frequency selective reflector (AFSR).
A systematic methodology based on the synthesis of the equivalent
circuit model (ECM) is presented to expedite the design of the
AFSR. The unit phasing element of the reflectarray is designed
in such a way that it exhibits minimum coupling between the
two orthogonal reflected LP-field components. Moreover, during
the reflectarray construction, a novel phase synthesis is used
which takes into account the possible lowest of the existing
mutual coupling while providing quadrature phase difference
between the orthogonal LP components with minimum phase
error. The proposed design is fabricated using 14 × 14 phasing
elements to experimentally validate the numerically simulated
results. The performance of the reflectarray is compared with
a conventional reflectarray without the AFSR. It is observed
that when the reflectarray is integrated with the AFSR, its gain

switchable 
absorber/reflector with polarization-insensitive characteristics. 
Initially, a narrowband absorber/reflector is realized. Later, 
lumped resistors are loaded in the same FSS geometry to 
obtain 
a 
switchable 
absorber/reflector 
for 
broadband 
frequencies. Both the designs consist of an AFSS layer printed 
at the uppermost surface of one dielectric substrate and a 
metal ground at the bottom of another dielectric substrate. The 
switchability between the absorption and reflection state is 
realized by regulating the PIN diode’s OFF/ON states, 
respectively, employed at the top AFSS layer. The simulated 
results show that the proposed narrowband structure resonates 
at 3.24 GHz with a reflection coefficient lower than -10 dB in 
absorber mode. It acts as a perfect reflector at the same 
frequency when switched to the reflector mode. In addition, the 
same structure acts as an absorber for broadband frequencies 
ranging from 4.89 GHz to 10.28 GHz with less than -10 dB 
reflection coefficients and a reflector from 4.89-7.95 GHz with 
a peak return loss of less than 3 dB after proper loading of 
lumped resistors and air-spacer. Furthermore, the biasing 
networks for the PIN diodes used in both the structures are 
embedded 
within 
the 
geometry,

The model-based image reconstruction approaches in pho-

analytical methods for cases where limited data is available. These methods
typically deploy Tikhonov based regularization scheme to reconstruct the
initial pressure from the boundary acoustic data. The model-resolution
for these cases represents the blur induced by the regularization scheme.
A method that utilizes this blurring model and performs the basis pursuit
deconvolution to improve the quantitative accuracy of the reconstructed
photoacoustic image is proposed and shown to be superior compared to
other traditional methods via three numerical experiments. Moreover, this
deconvolution including the building of an approximate blur matrix is
achieved via the Lanczos bidagonalization (least-squares QR) making this
approach attractive in real-time.

become indispensable for staging and managing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), and current evaluation of anom-
alies/abnormalities associated with COVID-19 has been per-
formed majorly by the visual score. The development of auto-
mated methods for quantifying COVID-19 abnormalities in these
CT images is invaluable to clinicians. The hallmark of COVID-19
in chest CT images is the presence of ground-glass opacities
in the lung region, which are tedious to segment manually.
We propose anamorphic depth embedding-based lightweight
CNN, called Anam-Net, to segment anomalies in COVID-19 chest
CT images. The proposed Anam-Net has 7.8 times fewer para-
meters compared to the state-of-the-art UNet (or its variants),
making it lightweight capable of providing inferences in mobile
or resource constraint (point-of-care) platforms. The results
from chest CT images (test cases) across different experiments
showed that the proposed method could provide good Dice
similarity scores for abnormal and normal regions in the lung.
We have benchmarked Anam-Net with other state-of-the-art
architectures, such as ENet, LEDNet, UNet++, SegNet, Attention
UNet, and DeepLabV3+. The proposed Anam-Net was also
deployed on embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA
Jetson Xavier, and mobile-based Android application (Cov-
Seg) embedded with Anam-Net to demonstrate its suitability
for point-of-care platforms. The generated codes, models, and
the mobile application are available for enthusiastic users at

179,Spatial heterogeneity of oxygenation and haemodynamics in breast cancer resolved in vivo by conical multispectral optoacoustic mesoscopy,"Abstract
The characteristics of tumour development and metastasis relate not only to genomic heterogeneity but also to
spatial heterogeneity, associated with variations in the intratumoural arrangement of cell populations, vascular
morphology and oxygen and nutrient supply. While optical (photonic) microscopy is commonly employed to visualize
the tumour microenvironment, it assesses only a few hundred cubic microns of tissue. Therefore, it is not suitable for
investigating biological processes at the level of the entire tumour, which can be at least four orders of magnitude
larger. In this study, we aimed to extend optical visualization and resolve spatial heterogeneity throughout the entire
tumour volume. We developed an optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscope adapted to solid tumour imaging and, in
a pilot study, offer the ﬁrst insights into cancer optical contrast heterogeneity in vivo at an unprecedented resolution
of <50 μm throughout the entire tumour mass. Using spectral methods, we resolve unknown patterns of oxygenation,
vasculature and perfusion in three types of breast cancer and showcase different levels of structural and functional
organization. To our knowledge, these results are the most detailed insights of optical signatures reported throughout
entire tumours in vivo, and they position optoacoustic mesoscopy as a unique investigational tool linking microscopic
and macroscopic observations."

179,"Theranostics  2018, Vol. 8, Issue 3 ","Abstract 
Objective: Monitoring emerging vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) and understanding the 
time-dynamics of treatment effects remains challenging. We interrogated whether handheld multispectral 
optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) could noninvasively monitor the effect of VTP using WST11, a 
vascular-acting photosensitizer, on tumor tissues over time using a renal cell cancer mouse model. We 
also investigated whether MSOT illumination can induce VTP, to implement a single-modality theranostic 
approach. 
Materials and Methods: Eight BalB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine renal 
adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA) on the flank. Three weeks later VTP was performed (10 min continuous 
illumination at 753 nm following intravenous infusion using WST11 or saline as control. Handheld MSOT 
images were collected prior to VTP administration and subsequently thereafter over the course of the 
first hour, at 24 and 48 h. Data collected were unmixed for blood oxygen saturation in tissue (SO2) based 
on the spectral signatures of deoxy- and oxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in oxygen saturation over 
time, relative to baseline, were examined by paired t-test for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In-vivo 
findings were corroborated by histological analyses of the tumor tissue.  
Results: MSOT is shown to prominently resolve changes in oxygen saturation in tumors within the first 20 
min post WST11-VTP treatment. Within the first hour post-treatment, SO2 decreased by more than 60% 
over baseline (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged (p > 0.1) in the sham-treated group. Moreover, 
unlike in the control group, SO2 in treated tumors further decreased over the course of 24 to 48 h 
post-treatment, concomitant with the propagation of profound central tumor necrosis present in 
histological analysis. We further show that pulsed MSOT illumination can activate WST11 as efficiently as 
the continuous wave irradiation employed for treatment.  
Conclusion: Handheld MSOT non-invasively monitored WST11-VTP effects based on the SO2 signal and 
detected blood saturation changes within the first 20 min post-treatment. MSOT may potentially serve as 
a means for both VTP induction and real-time VTP monitoring in a theranostic approach.

179,Fractional Regularization to Improve Photoacoustic Tomographic Image Reconstruction,"Abstract— Photoacoustic tomography involves recon-
structing the initial pressure rise distribution from the mea-
sured acoustic boundary data. The recovery of the initial
pressure rise distribution tends to be an ill-posed problem
in the presence of noise and when limited independent
data is available, necessitating regularization. The stan-
dard regularization schemes include Tikhonov, ℓ1-norm,
and total-variation. These regularization schemes weigh
the singular values equally irrespective of the noise level
present in the data. This paper introduces a fractional
framework to weigh the singular values with respect to
a fractional power. This fractional framework was imple-
mented for Tikhonov, ℓ1-norm, and total-variation regu-
larization schemes. Moreover, an automated method for
choosing the fractional power was also proposed. It was
shown theoretically and with numerical experiments that
the fractional power is inversely related to the data noise
level for fractional Tikhonov scheme. The fractional frame-
work outperforms the standard regularization schemes,
Tikhonov, ℓ1-norm, and total-variation by 54% in numerical
simulations, experimental phantoms, and in vivo rat data
in terms of observed contrast/signal-to-noise-ratio of the

forward model, noise, and other experimental factors, the
images are often afﬂicted by artifacts, occasionally mani-
fested as negative values. The aim of this work is to de-
velop an inversion method which reduces the occurrence
of negative values and improves the quantitative perfor-
mance of optoacoustic imaging. Methods: We present a
novel method for optoacoustic tomography based on an
entropy maximization algorithm, which uses logarithmic
regularization for attaining non-negative reconstructions.
The reconstruction image quality is further improved using
structural prior-based ﬂuence correction. Results: We re-
port the performance achieved by the entropy maximization
scheme on numerical simulation, experimental phantoms,
and in-vivo samples. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm
demonstrates superior reconstruction performance by de-
livering non-negative pixel values with no visible distor-
tion of anatomical structures. Signiﬁcance: Our method
can enable quantitative optoacoustic imaging, and has the
potential to improve preclinical and translational imaging
applications.

179,Siamese-SR: A Siamese Super-Resolution Model for Boosting Resolution of Digital Rock Images for Improved Petrophysical Property Estimation,"Abstract—Digital Rock Physics leverages advances in digital
image acquisition and analysis techniques to create 3D digital
images of rock samples, which are used for computational
modeling and simulations to predict petrophysical properties of
interest. However, the accuracy of the predictions is crucially
dependent on the quality of the digital images, which is currently
limited by the resolution of the micro-CT scanning technology.
We have proposed a novel Deep Learning based Super-Resolution
model called Siamese-SR to digitally boost the resolution of
Digital Rock images whilst retaining the texture and providing
optimal de-noising. The Siamese-SR model consists of a generator
which is adversarially trained with a relativistic and a siamese
discriminator utilizing Materials In Context (MINC) loss estima-
tor. This model has been demonstrated to improve the resolution
of sandstone rock images acquired using micro-CT scanning by
a factor of 2. Another key highlight of our work is that for the
evaluation of the super-resolution performance, we propose to
move away from image-based metrics such as Structural Similar-
ity (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) because they
do not correlate well with expert geological and petrophysical
evaluations. Instead, we propose to subject the super-resolved
images to the next step in the Digital Rock workﬂow to calculate
a crucial petrophysical property of interest, viz. porosity and
use it as a metric for evaluation of our proposed Siamese-SR
model against several other existing super-resolution methods like
SRGAN, ESRGAN, EDSR and SPSR. Furthermore, we also use

Integrins play an important role in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. Therefore we aimed to evaluate a
preclinical imaging approach applying ανβ3 integrin targeted hybrid Fluorescence Molecular Tomography/X-ray
Computed Tomography (FMT-XCT) for monitoring tumor progression as well as early therapy response in a syngeneic
murine Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) model. Lewis Lung Carcinomas were grown orthotopically in C57BL/6 J
mice and imaged in-vivo using a ανβ3 targeted near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe. ανβ3-targeted FMT-XCT was able
to track tumor progression. Cilengitide was able to substantially block the binding of the NIRF probe and suppress the
imaging signal. Additionally mice were treated with an established chemotherapy regimen of Cisplatin and Bevacizumab
or with a novel MEK inhibitor (Refametinib) for 2 weeks. While μCT revealed only a moderate slowdown of tumor growth,
ανβ3 dependent signal decreased significantly compared to non-treated mice already at one week post treatment. ανβ3
targeted imaging might therefore become a promising tool for assessment of early therapy response in the future.

179, ,"Abstract
Optoacoustic tomography aims to reconstruct maps of the initial pressure rise
induced by the absorption of light pulses in tissue. This reconstruction is an ill-
conditioned and under-determined problem, when the data acquisition protocol
involves limited detection positions. The aim of the work is to develop an inver-
sion method which integrates denoising procedure within the iterative model-based
reconstruction to improve quantitative performance of optoacoustic imaging. Among
the model-based schemes, total-variation (TV) constrained reconstruction scheme is
a popular approach. In this work, a two step approach was proposed for improving
the TV constrained optoacoustic inversion by adding a non-local means based ﬁlter-
ing step within each TV iteration. Compared to TV based reconstruction, inclusion
of this non-local means step resulted in signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 2.5 dB
in the reconstructed optoacoustic images."
180,Bee colony optimization aided adaptive resource allocation,"Abstract
Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) is a promising technique, which can provide
high downlink capacity for the emerging wireless systems.
The total capacity of OFDMA can be maximized by
adaptively assigning subcarriers to the users with the best
gains for those subcarriers, with power subsequently dis-
tributed by water-ﬁlling. In this paper, we propose the use
of artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithm combined with
Deb’s selection mechanism to handle the constraints. In
this scheme, a probabilistic selection scheme assigns
probability values to feasible solutions based on their ﬁt-
ness values and to infeasible individuals based on their
violations, to allocate the resources to the users in down-
link
OFDMA
system.
Speciﬁcally
we
propose
two
approaches for resource allocation in downlink OFDMA
systems using ABC algorithm. In the ﬁrst approach, ABC
algorithm is used for subcarrier allocation only, while in
second approach the ABC algorithm is used for joint
subcarrier and power allocation. It is shown that both these
approaches obtain higher sum capacities as compared to
that obtained by previous works, with comparable com-
putational complexity. It is also shown that the joint sub-
carrier and power allocation approach provides near
optimal results at the cost of slightly higher computational
cost."
180,Performance Evaluation of Tracking Loop under RF Interference using NavIC Software-Receiver,"Abstract—The Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) S-band
(i.e., 2492.028 MHz) signal is subject to interference from the unlicensed
terrestrial S-band sources. The performance of both code and carrier
tracking loops is degraded by external noise and interference leading
to degradation in Position Velocity Timing (PVT) solutions. Because of
its proximity to unlicensed S-band, the NavIC S-band is more prone
to radio-frequency interference (RFI) as compared to other navigation
bands. Therefore, in this paper, the effect of RFI on the parameters of
the tracking loop of NavIC S-band is analyzed using a software-deﬁned
receiver (SDR), and the results are presented. It is also shown through
simulations and real data that the effect of interference can be mitigated
by the optimized selection of tracking loop parameters like damping
ratio, noise bandwidth, and coherent integration time."

180,Genetic Algorithm Aided Proportional Fair Resource Allocation in Multicast OFDM Systems,"Abstract—The next-generation wireless communication net-
works are envisioned to offer many multimedia services such
as audio/video clips, mobile TV, web browsing, video confer-
ence, etc., with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements.
Multicasting/broadcasting has been recognized as an emerging
and enabling technique for such multimedia transmissions over
wireless networks. By employing multicast transmission, a base
station can transmit the same data content to several groups
of users requiring ﬂexible QoS. In this paper, we investigate
subchannel and power allocation problems in an OFDM-based
wireless multicast system. With the goal of maximizing the total
system capacity, a low complexity, novel genetic algorithm aided
efﬁcient subchannel allocation scheme taking into account the
constraints of total available bandwidth, proportional data rate
fairness and total transmit power budget at the base station is
proposed. The subchannel allocation is then followed by optimal
power allocation. Unlike previous work where either no fairness
or fairness based on number of subchannels allocated to the dif-
ferent groups was considered, we incorporate a set of system
parameters in the problem formulation such that the ratio of
the group data rates strictly follow the set of system parameters
after resource allocation. Simulation results show that the pro-
posed method obtains higher sum capacities while maintaining
proportional data rate fairness among different multicast groups,
without being awfully complex.

180,Rate adaptive resource allocation for multiuser OFDM using NSGA - II,"Abstract-- This paper presents a new rate adaptive resource 
allocation technique for multiuser Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We optimize both bit 
and subcarrier allocation by considering Rate maximization and 
Total Power constraint satisfaction. We solve them effectively by 
combining them into a multi-objective optimization problem. We 
propose using a Non Dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-
II) – a multi-objective optimization using Genetic Algorithm. 
Instead of combining many conflicting objectives into a single 
function, the NSGA-II uses multiple objective optimizations and 
brings out solutions which provide a better trade-off taking all 
conditions into consideration. The simulation results and their 
marked improvement over previous algorithms provide the basis 
to this."
180,Automatic Detection of GNSS Ionospheric Scintillation Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting Technique,"Abstract—Ionospheric scintillations caused by the ionospheric
plasma density irregularities adversely affect the positional accu-
racy of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver.
Machine learning methods are robust and efﬁcient for detecting
and classifying the ionospheric scintillation effects in GNSS
signals. In this letter, we propose an extreme gradient boosting
(XGBoost) based machine learning method to detect and classify
ionospheric amplitude scintillation, applied on a large global
positioning system (GPS) dataset collected from an equatorial
ionization anomaly (EIA) region, Sao Jose, Brazil (geographic:
23.2◦S 45.9◦W; dip latitude: 20.9◦S). The performance of the
proposed method is compared with a classiﬁer based on neural
network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree
(DT), and logistic regression (LR) methods. The confusion matrix
results show that the XGBoost method performed well, with
a prediction accuracy of 99.88% than other machine learning
methods. XGBoost algorithm handles the data irregularities
efﬁciently by setting a direction of descent through adaptive
learning and can subsample between the columns to reduce
the relevance of each weak learner. The performance results in
terms of F1 score, precision, recall, and area under precision-
recall curve (AUC-PR) indicates that the XGBoost algorithm can
characterize the ionospheric threats in GNSS signals to improve
the position accuracy."

system in terms of the number of LEDs as well as the power
required for satisfying the system performance requirements.
This is done by modeling the VLC using stochastic geometry,
where the random source array is generated using a binomial
point process (BPP) with a heuristic source power allocation for
obtaining average uniform illumination. BER analysis is done for
both circular and square BPPs. The theoretical BER results are
veriﬁed through simulations. The results obtained in the paper
are extremely useful for designing practical VLC systems from
traditional indoor lighting."
180,On the use of NSGA-II for multi-objective resource allocation,"Abstract
This paper investigates the problem of dynamic
subcarrier and bit allocation in downlink of Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiple Access (OFDMA) Systems. Using Singular Value
Decomposition, the MIMO fading channel of each sub-
carrier is transformed into an equivalent bank of parallel
Single Input Single Output sub-channels. To achieve the
capacity bound, one must solve a multiuser subcarrier
allocation and the optimal bit allocation jointly. To alle-
viate the computational complexity of joint subcarrier and
bit allocation, several suboptimal solutions have been
proposed. These suboptimal solutions handle subcarrier
and bits individually. We propose the use of Non-domi-
nated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-II, which is a
multi-objective Genetic Algorithm, for joint allocation of
bits and subcarriers, in the downlink of MIMO-OFDMA
system. NSGA-II is intended for optimization problems
involving multiple conﬂicting objectives. Here the two
conﬂicting objectives are Rate Maximization and Transmit
Power Minimization. The simulation results
indicate
remarkable improvement in terms of convergence over
previous approaches involving Evolutionary algorithms. At
the same time capacity achieved by the proposed algorithm
is found to be comparable with that of previous algorithms."
180,Carrier-Aided Dual-Frequency Vectorized Tracking Architecture for NavIC Signals,"Abstract—A
new
carrier-aided
dual-frequency
vectorized
tracking (CA-DFVT) architecture for the Navigation with Indian
Constellation (NavIC) is presented. CA-DFVT tracks both NavIC
L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S-band (2492.028 MHz) signals concur-
rently. It uses the precise carrier phase measurements from the
S-band signal and the unambiguous code phase measurements
from the L5 signal to form a new measurement model for
the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) to estimate the position,
velocity, and time (PVT) solutions. The new measurement model
takes advantage of the beneﬁts of the higher frequency S-
band signal, i.e., less ionospheric delay and carrier phase noise,
as well as the L5 signal’s inherent noise mitigation capabilities.
Compared to the single-frequency approach, the dual-frequency
approach in CA-DFVT eliminates the ionospheric effect and
minimizes other errors, resulting in better navigation solutions.
The proposed CA-DFVT enhances the reliability and robustness
of NavIC signal tracking and position estimation in interference
and high dynamics environments. We used static and dynamic
ﬁeld tests to validate the performance and robustness of the
proposed CA-DFVT receiver architecture. In comparison to
single-frequency (L5/S-band) vector tracking, the CA-DFVT
receiver demonstrated consistent signal tracking and position
estimation with higher position accuracy. In the static case, the
mean horizontal position accuracy of CA-DFVT improves by
approximately 2–4 and 9–14 m compared to L5-only VT and
S-only VT, respectively, while, in the dynamic case, it improves
by approximately 2–5 and 25–42 m, respectively."
180,OptMem2101009Balakrishnan.fm,"Abstract—Health monitoring of an aero-engine assumes importance in the light of primary require-
ments of flight safety and reliability. This paper proposes a novel, simple method for monitoring air-
craft engine health using Whale Optimization Algorithm based Artificial Neural Network (WOANN)
technique, for analyzing the data downloaded from the health and usage monitoring system (HUMS)
of a military aircraft. The actual engine data recorded during 47 different flights of eight different
engines (of the same type) have been considered in this work. Thirteen engine parameters have been
used to determine and monitor the health of the engine. The efficiency of the WOANN technique for
engine health monitoring, is compared with that of three other common machine learning algorithms:
Probabilistic based Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Back propagation
based Artificial Neural Network (BPANN). The results show that WOANN algorithm classifies and
predicts engine health far more accurately as compared to PNN, KNN and BPANN. The values
obtained for the metrics of Accuracy, Error, False Positive Rate, F1 score, Mathews Correlation Coef-
ficient, Specificity, Kappa coefficient are found to be the best for WOANN algorithm. The WOANN
achieved overall prediction accuracy of 95%, thus presenting itself as a very useful tool for day-to-day

180,Exact error analysis for the piecewise linear combiner for decode and forward cooperation with two relays,"Abstract—Exact expressions are obtained for the bit error rate

combiner, a close approximation to the maximum likelihood (ML)

contour integral approach for evaluating the Gil-Pelaez integral

Previous attempts relied on a direct approach, that imposed
restrictions on the location of the relays. In this paper, this
restriction has now been removed. Through simulation results,
we verify the validity of the derived analytical expressions."
180,A study of ionospheric effects on IRNSS/NavIC positioning at equatorial latitudes,"Abstract
The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS/NavIC) is fully operational and broadcasting radio
signals at L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S-band (2492.028 MHz). When these signals pass through the ionosphere,
carrier phase delay, which depends on Total Electron Content (TEC), causes error in positioning. Corrections are
applied in the augmented navigation system to minimize the position error due to TEC; however, 100% removal
of error is practically impossible. Thus, a study has been carried out to understand the role of ionospheric
determinants, such as TEC and scintillation S4, on the accuracy of augmented navigation over low latitude
region using a dual-frequency NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) receiver installed at BITS-Pilani
K.K. Birla Goa Campus (Geog. Lat. 15.39oN, Geog. Long. 73.87oE). Data collected using the Indian Space
Research Organization (ISROs) NavIC receiver (make DataPattern) during the low solar period between March
2019 to December 2019 is utilized for this study. The important ﬁndings of the study are as follows: (a) Mean
position error was in the range of 2-4 meters. (b) Diurnal variation of the position error indicated a maximum at
afternoon hours, coinciding with the time of maximum TEC over the EIA crest region. (c) Mean position error
in afternoon hours indicated a linear relation with mean TEC, in a scatter-plot analysis. (d) Statistically, the
position error during the scintillation nights was found to be similar to non-scintillation nights, indicating that
the post-sunset equatorial density depletions during low solar do not signiﬁcantly impact navigation accuracy.
Absolute position error during the active phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm of 14 May 2019 was found to be
signiﬁcantly higher compared to a quiet period, which also depends on the mode of operation of the augmented
navigation system. It was found that a hybrid NavIC (Dual) + GPS (SBAS) augmented navigation was more
accurate than NavIC with Dual Ionospheric corrections or NavIC with grid corrections, alone. Besides, the
dynamic behavior of the ionosphere, i.e., diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations of ionospheric TEC, have
also been studied using the iono-delay values derived from the NavIC receiver."

180,Traffic Offloading Problem in Two-Tier Hetnets with D2D Support for Emergency Communication,"Abstract—In emergency situations such as catastrophes, the
cellular infrastructure can be partially or totally damaged. For
rescue teams to transmit and receive on-sight reports using live
video and high quality images, the provisioning of seamless
coverage with high data rates is inevitable. As cellular networks
continue to evolve into more heterogeneous structures regarding
the size of deployed cells, the implementation of trafﬁc ofﬂoading
strategies is essential to achieve high data rates and more power
saving. In regard to network modeling, stochastic geometry has
been considered in the literature as an efﬁcient approach for
modeling the locations of base stations (BSs). Moreover, stochastic
geometry provides tractable mathematical expressions for key
network parameters such as coverage probability and average
data rate. In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), density and
power of BSs in a given tier inﬂuence the volume of trafﬁc
ofﬂoaded to other tiers. However, these two parameters are
generally constrained together in practical scenarios. In other
words, given a BS density, the power per BS must be adjusted to
satisfy the inter-tier trafﬁc ﬂow to maximized system throughput.
Furthermore, in D2D networks the fraction of spectrum allocated
to D2D links also affects the net achieved throughput. In this
paper, we formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the power
of small BSs (SBSs), SBS density, and the fraction of spectrum
allocated for D2D communications in order to maximize system
throughput for critical conditions such as rescue missions."
180,Composite differential evolution aided channel allocation in OFDMA systems with proportional rate constraints,"Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
is a promising technique, which can provide high downlink capac-
ity for the future wireless systems. The total capacity of OFDMA
can be maximized by adaptively assigning subchannels to the user
with the best gain for that subchannel, with power subsequently
distributed by water-ﬁlling. In this paper, we propose the use of
composite differential evolution (CoDE) algorithm to allocate the
subchannels. The CoDE algorithm is population-based where a set
of potential solutions evolves to approach a near-optimal solution
for the problem under study. CoDE uses three trial vector gener-
ation strategies and three control parameter settings. It randomly
combines them to generate trial vectors. In CoDE, three trial vec-
tors are generated for each target vector unlike other differential
evolution (DE) techniques where only a single trial vector is gen-
erated. Then the best one enters the next generation if it is better
than its target vector. It is shown that the proposed method obtains
higher sum capacities as compared to that obtained by previous
works, with comparable computational complexity."

for single relay maximum likelihood (ML) decode and forward
(DF) cooperative systems in Nakagami-�fading for binary phase
shift keying (BPSK). This is done by expressing the ML decision
variable in terms of functions of gamma CG random variables.
For the piecewise linear (PL) approximation to the ML detector,
a closed form expression for the BER is obtained. Simulation
results are provided to verify the validity of the derived analytical
expressions."
180,Influence of domain experience on icon recognition and preferences,"ABSTRACT
With the advance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensor networks, accurate understanding
of complex data via interface icons is critical for eﬀective decision making, operation management
and monitoring. In order to understand how the diﬀerent domain experience among icon designers
and users aﬀects icon recognition and preference level among users, this paper takes

workshops, in which icon recognition and preference tests are conducted based on the standard

new to the domain signiﬁcantly prefer icons created by designers who share similar levels of

180,Multiobjective Subchannel and Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Two-Tier OFDMA Femtocell Networks,"Abstract—The cochannel deployment of femtocells in a macro-
cell network is a cost-effective and efﬁcient way to increase net-
work coverage and capacity. However, such deployment is exigent
due to the presence of inter- and intratier interference and the ad
hoc operation of femtocells. Motivated by the ﬂexible subchannel
allocation capability of orthogonal frequency-division multiple
access, in this paper, we consider the problem of joint subchannel
and power allocation in both the uplink and downlink of a two-tier
orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based femtocell net-
work. It is a multiobjective optimization problem that aims to
maximize the throughput of all users, simultaneously increasing
the power efﬁciency of femtocell base stations. Interference to
macrocell users is kept below a certain tolerable threshold. The
minimum-rate requirements of delay-sensitive users are also taken
into consideration. The problem is solved using nondominated
sorting genetic algorithm version II, and the results are compared
with the existing solution."
180,"Marine soundscape and fish chorus in an archipelago ecosystem comprising bio-diverse tropical islands off Goa Coast, India","Abstract
Many biological sources of sound in
tropical coastal shallow-water marine environments
remain unidentiﬁed. Characterizing the soundscape of
such environments requires that all sources of biolog-
ical sound be examined for their distinct patterns and
speciﬁc frequency ranges. The present study identiﬁed
soniferous ﬁsh in the ecosystem and measured under-
water ambient sound in terms of its sound pressure
levels (SPL) to quantify and characterize their contri-
bution to the soundscape. Underwater SPLs were
measured from 2012 to 2016 at a site near Grande
Island Archipelago (15 180 N, 73 410 E) 18 km off
the coast of the state of Goa, which lies along India’s
western coast. Acoustic data were recorded using three
types of methods for passive acoustic monitoring,
namely a hanging hydrophone, ﬁve seabed-mounted
hydrophones and an autonomous moored vertical
hydrophone. Underwater visual census at the site
revealed that both species richness and diversity were
high indicating the Grande Island Archipelago is a bio-
diverse site. The seabed-mounted hydrophones proved
to be the best choice for long-term SPL measurements,
although the moored arrays were more economical.
Ambient sound levels underwater varied markedly
over time both within a day and with the season. Long-
term SPLs were above 100 dB re 1 lPa over frequen-
cies 62.5–8000 Hz and peaked to 120–130 dB re"
180,Diversity gain using a repeater in a wireless personal area network,"Abstract— In this paper we show that a one-hop repeater in
an ultra-wideband (UWB) communication system for a wireless
personal area network (WPAN) can be used to achieve diversity
gain in a Rayleigh fading channel. We use maximal ratio
combining (MRC) in the transmitter-repeater link and space-time
coding (STC) in the repeater-receiver link, where the repeater
has two antennas for transmission as well as reception. The
repeater transmits at a higher rate than the transmitter so
that the symbols are properly synchronized. We then derive
the closed-form expression for the probability of bit error and
show that there exists a trade-off between the bit error rate
(BER) performance and the transmit powers of the transmitter
and the repeater. Based on our BER curves, we then show that
the performance of the proposed system is much better than a
conventional repeater as well as the traditional communication
system."
180,arXiv:1307.4733v1  [cs.IT]  17 Jul 20131,"Abstract
Cooperation in a cellular network is seen as a key technique in managing other cell interference to observe a gain in achievable
rate. In this paper, we present the achievable rate regions for a cloud radio network using a sub-optimal zero forcing equalizer
with dirty paper precoding. We show that when complete channel state information is available at the cloud, rates close to those
achievable with total interference cancellation can be achieved. With mean capacity gains, of up to 200 % over the conventional
cellular network in both uplink and downlink, this precoding scheme shows great promise for implementation in a cloud radio
network. To simplify the analysis, we use a stochastic geometric framework based of Poisson point processes instead of the
traditional grid based cellular network model.
We also study the impact of limiting the channel state information and geographical clustering to limit the cloud size on the
achievable rate. We have observed that using this zero forcing-dirty paper coding technique, the adverse effect of inter-cluster
interference can be minimized thereby transforming an interference limited network into a noise limited network as experienced
by an average user in the network for low operating signal-to-noise-ratios. However, for higher signal-to-noise-ratios, both the
average achievable rate and cell-edge achievable rate saturate as observed in literature. As the implementation of dirty paper
coding is practically not feasible, we present a practical design of a cloud radio network using cloud a minimum mean square
equalizer for processing the uplink streams and use Tomlinson-Harashima precoder as a sub-optimal substitute for a dirty paper
precoder in downlink.

180,Symbol detection in CDMA-OFDM coexistence,"Abstract- Code division multiple access (CDMA) and Orthog-
onal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are two techniques
that are being commonly used in most wireless communication
systems. In this paper we examine the coexistence of the above
schemes through a two user communication system, i.e., one user
transmits using CDMA and the other transmits using OFDM.
Using an OFDM based receiver, we derive the received symbols
at the output of each branch of the OFDM demodulator. The
symbols transmitted by the CDMA user are then detected using
the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) approach,
an array processing technique commonly used in beamforming.
Through simulations, we then show that the MPDR method is
indeed very efficient in suppressing the OFDM interference.

This paper proposes a small target disease detection method using YOLOv5

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) received significant 
attention in the field of wireless communications during the last ten 
years, particularly focusing on Power-Domain NOMA (PD-
NOMA) that uses a successive interference cancellation (SIC) 
receiver. This review paper reexamines PD-NOMA from a 
pragmatic angle and sheds light on its virtues and limitations in 
uplink and downlink scenarios. We observe that the concept of PD-
NOMA in the downlink can be seen as a pure signal constellation 
design and that a simple threshold detector is sufficient at the 
receiver end. For the uplink, we first address the fairness concerns 
arising from the mismatch between the users’ data rates that can be 
achieved by the SIC receiver and the fair rates suggested by the 
power distribution among users. Furthermore, we discuss findings 
from a recent analysis comparing PD-NOMA to Multi-User MIMO 
under a common system framework. This study reveals that 
assigning the same power levels to users, thereby aligning PD-
NOMA with Multi-User MIMO, optimizes performance in terms 
of average bit error rate. These insights raise questions about the 
fundamental utility of PD-NOMA and suggest that its best 
application is hierarchical multiple access, where devices with 
different power capabilities are paired together."

Abstract—The potentials of federated learning are currently
being explored for privacy-preserving intrusion detection in
smart critical infrastructure. However, previous works did not
consider the determination of optimal model hyperparameters,
class imbalance in the training data, high memory space require-
ment for network traffic data storage in resource-constrained
edge nodes, and zero-day botnet attack scenarios. In this paper,
we propose an optimized lightweight Federated Deep Learning

tructure. First, an optimization method is developed to determine
the most appropriate combination of model hyperparameters
for local Deep Learning (DL) at the edge nodes. Then, an
oversampling algorithm is combined with the optimal DL model
to improve the classification performance when the training
data is highly imbalanced, without a significant increase in the
overall computation time. Furthermore, a feature dimensionality
reduction method is used to reduce the amount of memory
space required to store the network traffic data at the edge
nodes. Experiments are performed using the Bot-IoT and N-
BaIoT datasets, and the FDL model achieved high classification
performance with low memory space requirement."
181,Automatic Modulation Classication Method for Multiple Antenna,"Abstract
In order to transmit communication signals of
diﬀerent properties, quickly, eﬀectively, and accurately, various
diﬀerent modulation styles can be adopted. Accurate recognition
of signal modulation is required at the receive side. Automatic
modulation recognition (AMR) is a key technique to identify
various styles of modulation of signals received in wireless
channels. It can be used in many kinds of communication systems,
including single antenna system and multiple antenna system. In
this paper, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)
aided AMR method for multiple antenna system. Compared with
the high order cumulants (HOC) and artiﬁcial neural networks
(ANN) aided traditional AMR classiﬁcation method, both with
two speciﬁc combination strategies, such as relative majority
voting method and arithmetic mean method, the proposed
AMR with arithmetic mean method has the best classiﬁcation
performance. The experimental results obtained verify that the
CNN, one of the representative algorithms of deep learning, has
a strong ability to exploit dominant features and classify the
modulation styles."

Backscatter communication (BackCom) is a promising technique for achieving high spectrum eﬃciency and power eﬃciency in
the future Internet of Things systems. The capacity of BackCom networks can be maximized by optimizing the backscatter
time and the reﬂection coeﬃcient (RC). However, system energy eﬃciency (EE) cannot be guaranteed usually. In this paper,
we investigate the energy-eﬃcient resource allocation problem of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based BackCom.
Particularly, the base station (BS) transmits signals to two cellular users based on the NOMA protocol, meanwhile, a backscatter
device backscatters the signals to users using the passive radio technology. The total EE of the considered system is maximized
by jointly optimizing power allocation for each NOMA user and the RC of backscatter device where the decoding order and
the quality of service (QoS) of each user are guaranteed. To solve such a non-convex problem, we develop an eﬃcient iterative
algorithm to obtain the optimal solutions by using Dinkelbach’s method and the quadratic transformation approach. Numerical
results show that the proposed algorithm can signiﬁcantly improve the system EE compared with the orthogonal multiple access
(OMA) scheme and the NOMA system without backscatter devices.

of envelope correlation coefﬁcient (ECC) of any arbitrary

wide frequency band. Both frequency-domain (FD) and time-
domain (TD) postprocessing techniques are proposed for possible
application with this FDTD-CGF scheme. The FDTD-CGF-TD
scheme utilizes TD signal-processing methods and exhibits signif-
icant reduction in ECC computation time as compared with the
FDTD-CGF-FD scheme, for high-frequency resolution require-
ments. The proposed FDTD-CGF-based schemes can be applied
for accurate and fast prediction of wideband ECC response,
instead of the conventional scattering parameter-based tech-
niques which have several limitations. Numerical examples of the
proposed FDTD-CGF techniques are provided for two-element

Furthermore, examples of two-element MIMO systems involving

general
computational
paradigm,
the
time-
domain inﬁnitesimal dipole model (IDM) method, is developed
and applied to compute reactive energy and radiated power for
arbitrary shaped antennas with different time-domain excita-
tions. The proposed technique ﬁrst utilizes ﬁnite-difference time-
domain method to compute the time-domain radiating antenna
currents from near-zone electric/magnetic ﬁelds. Further, the far-
zone time-domain radiated power is analytically estimated using
a suitable IDM of the antenna spacetime current distributions.
The time-domain reactive energy is calculated by adopting a rig-
orous energy subtraction approach. The proposed time-domain
IDM technique is ﬁrst validated by reproducing the standard
antenna-Q-factor results of half-wavelength thin-wire dipoles.
Second, time-domain reactive energy signatures are obtained
for pulse-excited single and multiband dipole antennas, both in
isolated condition and two-element multi-in multi-out (MIMO)
topology. Third, the effects of parasitic reﬂector and director
elements on the spatio-temporal energy dynamics of thin-wire
Yagi–Uda antennas are demonstrated. The proposed algorithm
is very general, applicable to arbitrary antenna shape and space-

demands manual analysis, often leading to inaccuracies. While
recent advancements have enabled automated analysis in surveil-
lance video stream monitoring, challenges persist in achieving
high accuracy and efficiency. Thus, an automated system is
needed to monitor and report on video streams in real-time or

framework that integrates a hybrid quantum-classical anomaly
detection system, a caption-generating model, and a novel Text-

created labelled dataset called UCFC-CUR which prioritises
crimes based on their urgency. The hybrid classifier outperforms
its direct classical counterpart by 7.7%. The aforementioned
pipeline possesses the capability to identify anomalous occur-
rences from surveillance videos, generate a textual representation
of the event, and assign a numerical value indicating the level
of urgency associated with the specific anomaly. The hybrid

183,Artificial Intelligence Empowered Digital Twin and NFT-Based Patient Monitoring and Assisting Framework for Chronic Disease Patients,"Abstract
People suffering from chronic diseases require 
continuous support in monitoring their nutrition, 
diagnostic tests, medication, and daily activity 
tracking. Given the low ratio of patients to health-
care providers, it becomes infeasible to provide 
one-to-one support to patients. Furthermore the 
existing online medical consultation platforms 
are costly for regular approach. Addressing these 
issues, we propose to monitor and assist patients 
suffering from chronic disease using a novel 
AI-based and IoT-supported digital twin platform. 
A digital twin of a patient grows with the patient, 
and it helps in continuous and remote patient 
monitoring. Further, the digital twin enables the 
creation of patient-specific personalized treatment 
models, enabling doctors to conduct virtual simu-
lations of the suitability of certain drugs and pro-
cedures. The data collected from the digital twin 
is fed to machine learning models for intelligent 
analysis, feedback, and support. The proposed 
solution incorporates five essential machine learn-
ing models using novel algorithms for drug rec-
ommendation, chronic disease stage detection, 
nutrition tracking and recommendation, patient 
activity tracking, and patient data anonymization. 
Addressing patients’ lack of motivation to partici-
pate in emerging patient monitoring frameworks, 
we incorporate an incentive mechanism rooted in 
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to encourage active 
participation in patients, which also has the added 
benefit of helping patients to store their historical 
medical data securely."

Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodological development in a broad 
range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) 
and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision 
making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in 
mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the diffi-
culty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making 
process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art 
in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. 
To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and 
inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the 
current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks

Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders have been storing medical prescriptions and other relevant
reports electronically. These reports contain the personal information of the patients, which is sensitive data. Therefore,
there exists a need to store these records in a decentralized model (using IPFS and Ethereum decentralized application) to
provide data and identity protection. Many patients recurrently visit doctors and undergo treatments while receiving
different prescriptions and reports. In case of an emergency, the doctors and attendants may need and beneﬁt from the
patients’ medical history. However, they are unable to go through medical history and a wide range of previous reports and
prescriptions due to time constraints. In this paper, we propose an AI-assisted blockchain-based framework in which the
stored medical records (handwritten prescriptions, printed prescriptions, and printed reports) are stored and processed using
various AI techniques like optical character recognition (OCR) to form a single patient medical history report. The report
concisely presents only the crucial information for convenience and perusal and is stored securely over a decentralized

error. Further, the RMSLE outcome shows 0.351 which is the
lowest error value given by the proposed model. Further, the most

183,Federated Learning and NFT-Based Privacy-Preserving Medical-Data-Sharing Scheme for Intelligent Diagnosis in Smart Healthcare,"Abstract—Historical patients’ medical data has an important
impact on the healthcare industry for providing the best care
to patients through intelligent health diagnosis and prediction
of diseases. The existing intelligent health diagnosis systems col-
lect data from medical institutions or laboratories and then use
machine learning algorithms to predict diseases. But, in most
cases, the medical institutions have incomplete medical data of
the patients since a patient may consult different specialists (from
various hospitals) during the treatment process. To overcome this
problem, we build a smart and secure federated learning frame-
work for intelligent health diagnosis with a blockchain-based
incentive mechanism and nonfungible tokens (NFTs)-based mar-
ketplace. We make use of NFTs to develop clear demarkations
on the ownership and accessibility of the data of patients. We
create an NFT marketplace that manages access to the historical
medical data of patients. A comprehensive incentive mechanism
based on several factors, including the quality and relevance
of the data, the frequency, regularity of data uploading, etc.,
is incorporated to encourage and penalize the patients based
on their contributions to the global model. We used the Polyak-
averaging technique for aggregating local models to form a global
model. The extensive analysis shows that the proposed model
achieves comparable performance with the centralized machine
learning models while affording better security and access to
better data. The results also show the efﬁcacy of the proposed
blockchain-based incentive mechanism."
183,Incentivization and Aggregation Schemes for Federated Learning Applications,"ABSTRACT
Currently, the data collected by the Internet of Things (IoT) still relies on the cloud-centric data
aggregation and processing approach for preparing machine learning models. This approach puts the privacy
of the participants at risk. In this paper, federated learning (FL) is proposed for privacy-preserving collabo-
rative model training on data distributed across IoT users. To motivate participants, we must incentivize the
whole process by rewarding each participant for their contribution to the training process of the federated
learning model. The process of collective training takes place over a long duration of time and multiple
iterations. However, participants in the training process may have varying levels of willingness to participate
(WTP) and may contribute duplicate or poor-quality data. Therefore, in each iteration, participants must be
rewarded based on their contribution in that specific iteration. In this paper, a methodology to reward each
participant based on their contribution and a model aggregation technique are proposed. The aggregation
technique uses Polyak-averaging to aggregate weights of local models, with the weightage assigned to
each local model being proportional to its accuracy on the test dataset. Performance evaluation shows that
the federated learning model formed using our aggregation approach achieves the performance level of
machine learning as we perform more iterations and performs slightly better than the model formed using the
FedAvg algorithm. Additionally, our incentivization methodology provides better performance-based rewards
compared to other profit-sharing schemes."

184,ORIGINAL PAPER,"Abstract Clubfoot is the commonest congenital deformity
in babies. More than 100,000 babies are born worldwide
each year with congenital clubfoot. Around 80% of the cases
occur in developing nations. We treated 154 feet [mean
Pirani score (total) 5.57] in 96 children (78 males, 18
females) by the Ponseti method from January 2003 to
December 2005. A prospective follow-up for a mean
duration of 19.5 months (range 6–32 months) was under-
taken. After six months of treatment the Pirani score was
reduced to zero for all patients. The results show that
corrective surgery, sometimes multiple, can be avoided in
most cases which are usually associated with the develop-
ment of a stiff, painful foot. Low socio-economic status and
illiteracy prevailing in developing nations increases the
prevalence of neglected clubfoot that is still harder to correct.
Integration into various programs and proper use of available
resources can decrease neglected clubfoot and improve
chances of successful and timely correction of deformity.
Bracing constitutes an important part of treatment and proper
motivation and education of the parents mitigates the
chances of losing correction. The Ponseti method of
correcting clubfoot is especially important in developing
countries, where operative facilities are not available in the
remote areas and well-trained physicians and personnel can
manage the cases effectively with cast treatment only.
Résumé Le pied bot est parmi les déformations les plus
habituelles chez l’enfant. Plus de 100.000 enfants naissent
chaque année avec un pied bot congénital. 80% des cas
proviennent des pays en voie de développement. Nous
avons traité 150 cas de pieds avec un score de Pirani moyen
de 5.57 chez 96 enfants. 78 étaient de sexe masculin, 18 de
sexe féminin. Nous avons utilisé la méthode de Ponseti de
janvier 2003 à décembre 2005. Une étude prospective a été
réalisée sur une période de 19,5 mois (6 à 32 mois). Après
six mois de traitement, le score de Pirani a été réduit à 0
chez tous les patients. Le résultat montre qu’une correction
chirurgicale peut être parfois nécessaire dans les cas
présentant un pied raide et très douloureux. L’utilisation
de toutes les ressources nécessaires permettent de diminuer
le nombre de pieds bots négligés et d’améliorer les chances
de succès du traitement de cette déformation. Le traitement
orthopédique est une part importante du traitement et la
motivation et l’éducation des parents augmentent les
chances de succès et diminuent les pertes de correction.
La méthode de Ponseti est très importante dans les pays en
voie de développement (80%) où les conditions opératoires
ne sont pas très faciles et nécessitent un personnel entraîné."
184,FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOMChE 2004 PAPERS,"Abstract 
The use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is essential in many applications. To 
offer innovative capabilities and solutions, WSN presents novel methods. In terms 
of energy autonomy, the limited resources of the sensor node are a real constraint. 
While considering other conflicting terms like less secure routing and energy 
consumption, its goal is to improve network lifetime and avoid node failure to 
reduce data transmission delays. The Optimization formulation is presented to 
select CH to increase network lifetime and reduce energy consumption to solve 
routing issues. An effective optimization method offers the best solution. A major 
factor is a connectivity, if connectivity may lose because of a node failure, which 
creates network disruption by generating energy losses or network fails. In this 
paper, the Enhanced Salp Swarm Algorithm (ES2A) is proposed to optimize the 
network by replacing it to find the faulty one and then replacing it with its 
neighbouring node to transfer the data packets. This work guarantees the reduced 
energy consumption of the nodes, which guarantees the network's maximum 
lifetime. As nodes are reduced, energy consumption is also reduced accordingly. 
The experimental result is carried out on the NS2 platform. The performance 
metrics of the ES2A were enhanced when compared to the existing schemes, which 
are as follows, the lifetime of the network reaches 85.69%, the energy consumption 
is 15.87%, and the loss of packets in the network is 12%, throughput is 79.9%, and 
the delivery ratio of packets reaches 98.02%."

184,Impact of Space Charge Modulation on Superjunction-LDMOS,"ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we present the impact of Superjunction (SJ) implant 
on the performance challenges encountered by LDMOS in the ON-
state while developing insights into Space Charge Modulation (SCM) 
and Quasi-Saturation (QS) behavior in these devices. SJ-device is 
reported to have four times higher breakdown voltage than the 
conventional LDMOS device which proves to be an outstanding 
candidate for switching applications. This paper elucidates the design 
guidelines for SJ-devices in order to maximize the ON-state 
performance by mitigating SCM and QS effects while keeping in mind 
the OFF-state breakdown requirements."

and performance of junctionless and inversion modes

185,Non-planar Frequency Selective Surface based Bandstop Filter for Electromagnetic Shielding,"Abstract—This paper presents a frequency selective surface
(FSS) based bandstop filter design that has been implemented on
different non-planar surfaces for electromagnetic (EM) shielding
applications. The unit cell of the FSS features a metallic annular
ring geometry printed on a polylactic acid (PLA) dielectric
material periodically. The structure has initially been studied on
a planar surface and a bandstop response is observed ranging
from 8.56 to 1"
185,An FSS-based Conformal Band-stop Filter Design for Planar and Non-planar Surfaces,"Abstract—This paper presents a frequency selective 
surface (FSS)-based conformal bandstop filter design for use 
in different types of planar and non-planar surfaces. The unit 
cell of the proposed geometry is based on a single metallic 
square loop printed on a dielectric substrate. The overall 
structure exhibits a bandstop response in the frequency range 
of 6.68 to 12.66 GHz, with a center frequency at 9.53 GHz. 
The topology is initially analyzed with respect to circuit 
modeling, surface current distribution, and parametric 
variation. Afterward, the structure is studied under different 
types of non-planar surfaces (x-axis curve, y-axis curve, xy-
axis curve, hemispherical surface) using the finite element 
boundary integral (FEBI) method, and the bandstop filter 
response is observed across the operating band (with 
transmission coefficient < –10 dB) for all cases. The matching 
between the planar and non-planar responses confirms the 
conformal behavior of the proposed FSS structure."

field as input of ELM for the prediction of scattered fields 
from dielectric objects. The scattered field from ELM 
prediction, conventional FDTD and commercial package 
TaraNG follow each other closely over the time steps. This 
technique can predict with high accuracy while the absolute 
error percentage remains below 0.04. The ELM prediction is 
almost instantaneous whereas FDTD and TaraNG require 
much larger computing time."
185,An Innovative Mapping Technique for Sinusoidal Frequency Selective Surfaces in Shielding Applications,"Abstract— This letter presents an innovative mapping 
technique to design and demonstrate a frequency selective surface 
(FSS) based bandstop filter on a sinusoidal surface. The novelty of 
the method lies in the uniform placement of the unit cells on 
different non-planar surfaces using a hybrid method comprising 
an analytical technique and full-wave simulation that significantly 
improves the shielding characteristic in a wideband spectrum 
(having a -10 dB stopband from 7 to 13 GHz with a fractional 
bandwidth of 60%). A conventional metallic square loop is 
considered as the constituent unit cell topology, which is 
intelligibly positioned over a large surface using the proposed 
method. The structure is then simulated using the finite element 
boundary integral, as well as fabricated exploiting the three-
dimensional (3-D) printing technology, thereby validating the 
proposed concept. Such non-planar FSS geometries have potential 
in diverse applications, including shielding and aerospace sectors.

185,Hole-Free DCA for Augmented Co-Prime Array,"Abstract
This paper focuses on developing a hole-ﬁlling technique for difference co-array
(DCA) of the co-prime array and its variants. In existing methods, obtaining DCA
uses vectorization of the covariance matrix obtained from received signals employing
Khatri–Rao product. For the co-prime array (CA) family, the DCA so obtained con-
sists of a set of virtual contiguous elements and multiple non-uniform virtual elements.
Till now, the DOA estimation from the CA family considers only virtual contiguous
elements of the DCA, leaving out “holes” and other virtual non-uniform elements.
This existence of holes results in a substantial decrease in consecutive degrees of
freedom than expected. To address the issue of holes (in the DCA of CA family),
this paper extends the original DCA of augmented CA to obtain a new virtual DCA
called AC AE DC A. The AC AE DC A is virtually hole-free. Compared to DCA of the
existing CA family, the resulting AC AE DC A has a larger effective DOF. Therefore,
the aperture length compared to other existing variants of the co-prime array is also
larger. Simulations compare performances of 9 element ACA using AC AE DC A with
few other arrays of the CA family. With and without using AC AE DC A, the ACA
respectively resolves 43 and 14 sources. Sliding extended CA and relocating extended
CA respectively determine 22 and 25 sources. Similarly, the root-mean-square error
performance of ACA using AC AE DC A is better compared to others."

187,Deep Trap Characterization and the Kink Effect in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs,"ABSTRACT
This article presents the study of trapping effects in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
(HEMTs). Conventional methods like temperature-dependent capacitance-voltage (CV) and pulsed-
IV (PIV) have been employed to quantify the traps present in the device layers. Apparent threshold
voltage (VTH) instability as well as lag in the drain current after pulsing are evident. The kink in
the drain current has been taken up to observe the trapping signature for devices with two differ-
ent gate lengths. A modified drain and gate pumping methodology which has been designated
as pre-measurement run (PMR) has been presented to get a deeper insight into the kink effect
in these devices. Constant maximum field (CMF) PMR shows substantial change in the drain cur-
rent, whereas negligible change for variable maximum field (VMF) PMR is observed, which confirms
the dominant impact of trapping within the heterostructure and field assisted detrapping through
Poole-Frenkel emission. Multiple traps have also been identified within the epitaxial layers with the
E2 trap (Ea (activation energy) = 0.69 eV) which can be held responsible for the kink observed in the
DC characteristics as observed from pulsed drain lag characteristics."

This paper presents a comprehensive TCAD based assessment to evaluate the intrinsic gain and minimum noise figure metrics of
the T – Gate, and the π – Gate AlGaN/AlN/GaN HEMTs along with their recessed architectures. The work presented in this
paper, to the best of author’s knowledge, is first in its attempt to systematically bring out both the effect of minimum noise figure
metrics and intrinsic gain at the device level for the π – Gate architecture and their recessed counterparts whilst evaluating its
stability for high frequency operations. Comparison demonstrates an enhancement in intrinsic gain by 64.5% in case of asym-
metric π – Gate and 77% for asymmetric recessed π – Gate in comparison to their T – Gate counterparts. Further, the said
architectures possess a wider range of flat gain operation with suppressed values of minimum noise figure metrics. These
modifications result in a modest trade off in the minimum noise figures when best case is considered and compared with their
T – Gate counterparts. Additionally, it is also demonstrated that such device architectures demonstrate much stable high
frequency operation in comparison to their primer. The results so presented establish the superiority of the π – Gate AlGaN/
AlN/GaN HEMTs for low noise and high gain applications."
187,Pulsed-IV and drain current transient study of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs,"Abstract—A study of pulsed-IV and drain current transients
for unpassivated and SiN passivated AlGaN/GaN high electron
mobility transistors (HEMTs) have been carried out in this
report to observe the impact of traps in these devices. Pulsed-
IV (PIV) characteristics for gate turn-on and gate turn-off
to semi-on state for different pulsewidths (PW) reveal the
effect of passivation. The unpassivated HEMT shows degraded
characteristics suffering from signiﬁcant current collapse due
to surface states in the gate-drain access regions. Both devices
observe kink in the drain current with passivated HEMT
exhibiting kink for PW > 30 µs. Drain current transient
study from emission characteristics reveal traps with activation
energies from 0.43-0.68 eV in the devices. The trapping phe-
nomenon in unpassivated HEMT is governed by surface traps
through virtual gate formation. The passivated HEMT checks
the surface trapping but is vulnerable due to energetically deep
bulk traps.

187,Ohmic contact morphology improvement with reduced resistance using Si/Au/Ti/Al/Ni/Au (AlGaN) and Si/Au/Ti/Al/Ni/Au (InAlN) stack layers in III-Nitride HEMTs,"Abstract
This article reports a Ti/Al-based ohmic contact utilizing a thin interfacial Au layer for
improved morphology, edge acuity and low contact resistance for applications to III-Nitride
high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). Conventional Ti/Al contacts are based on a metal
stack of the form Ti/Al/X/Au, where X is any suitable barrier layer such as Ni. The formation of
ohmic contact in GaN and its alloy systems is governed by the formation of TiN during
annealing; Au inter-diffusion during annealing also assists the formation of TiN islands and aids
in reducing the contact resistance. Furthermore, inter-metallic phase formation between Ti and
Al lowers the contact resistance. It is observed that the contact surface morphology strongly
depends on the top Au layer thickness. Insertion of a very thin Au layer (2–3 nm) has drastically
improved the surface quality with the achievement of contact resistance as low as 0.36 Ωmm
and a specific contact resistance of 2.4 × 10−6 Ωcm2 on AlGaN/GaN HEMT. The reduction in
contact resistance is due to the formation of more conducting intermetallic phases during
annealing, which is assisted due to the thin Au layer insertion. Further reduction in the contact
resistance to 0.13 Ωmm was also achieved with the"
187,Improvement in Schottky barrier inhomogeneities of Ni/AlGaN/GaN Schottky diodes after cumulative -ray irradiation,"Abstract
This article reports the effect of gamma (γ)-ray irradiation on barrier inhomogeneities that leads
towards improvement in diode parameters in Ni-AlGaN/GaN Schottky diodes. The Schottky
diodes were subjected to a cumulative γ-ray dose up to 15 kGy and their current–voltage (I–V)
and capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics were measured simultaneously at different
temperatures during the pristine stage and after each radiation dose. The Schottky barrier height
(Φb) had an increase of 10% to 20% in the temperature range greater than 250 K. Whereas, the
change in the ideality factor (η) was found to be prevalent at lower temperatures (<250 K). More
linearity in the behavior of η variation with temperature was found post γ-irradiation showing
an improvement in homogeneity of the metal/semiconductor interface. Post γ-ray exposure,
barrier inhomogeneities at the metal/semiconductor interface were found to reduce due to
annealing effects that also led towards an increase in the contribution of thermionic emission
current flow. Further, a decrease of 16% in the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution of
Φb around the mean Φb was obtained. A decrease in contact resistance (RC) was deduced using a
circular transmission line method, which was also due to the partial annealing effect of γ-ray
radiation. Finally, the channel carrier concentration (ns), extracted using C–V analysis, was
found to remain unaltered."
187,Advances in DC/RF Performance of AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMT by Incorporating Dual Metal Gate Architecture,"ABSTRACT
This study presents a modified version of MIS-HEMT via incorporation of dielectric pocket with a dual
metal enabled gate (DP-DMG) architecture to achieve an enhancement in the electrical performance
of AlGaN/GaN HEMT. A noteworthy improvement in DC/RF characteristics is observed with DP-DMG
HEMT in comparison to conventionally used single metal gated Schottky (SMG) HEMT including
gate leakage. Moreover, DP-DMG is further studied with different dielectrics to tune its electrical
performance along with the depth of the dielectric pocket. The maximum rise in drain current and
transconductance achieved with different dielectric DP-DMG HEMT is 13% and 13.5%, respectively.
Apart from this, a significant positive shift of ∼0.6 V is recorded with HfO2 with a dielectric thickness
of 5 nm. RF simulations showed significant improvement ( ∼2×) in the cut-off frequency of DP-DMG
HEMT in comparison to SMG HEMT."
187,Enhancement in Electrical Characteristics,"Abstract. This study presents enhancement of AlGaN/GaN HEMT device elec-
trical characteristics by employing different gate engineered architectures. The

AlGaN and gate dielectric (HfSiO4) in order to extract the advantages offered by
the individuals. A remarkable improvement in transconductance (8%) and drain
current (~13 & 7%) is achieved with dual-metal-gated HEMT as well as with the
proposed dielectric pocket (DP) dual-metal-gated HEMT device. The increased
OFF-state leakage with the incorporation of dual-metal gate is suppressed suc-
cessfully with the implication of dielectric pocket dual-metal gate structure. Apart
from this, DP-DMG HEMTs has a 0.15 V positive shift in the threshold voltage in
comparison with conventional SMG-HEMT, and therefore, this dielectric pocket
HEMT can be seen as an upgradation to the next generation of HEMT devices."

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the nanoscale material’s structural properties have to be

187,Interplay Between <italic>&#x03B3;</italic>&#x2013;Ray Irradiation and 3DEG for Dosimeter Applications,"ABSTRACT
This work investigates the cumulative dose 60Co gamma (γ ) – ray irradiation effects on
enhancement mode HEMT devices inheriting 3D – Electron and Hole Gases for dosimeter applications.
The devices are irradiated through a 60Co source and demonstrate the enhancement in the drain current
metrics. To elucidate, the said devices were irradiated through different mechanisms and the Compton effect
was investigated through contour plots via TCAD simulations. The degradation of Schottky Gate contact and
insulator charging affects the 2D – Hole Gas at the GaN cap and thereby affects the bottleneck at the 3DEG
sheet. This signiﬁcantly affects the OFF – state leakage components of the said device and can therefore be
exploited for potential use in sensing and dosimeter applications. The leakage components can be exploited
further to improve the linearity of the dosimeter by considering different grading proﬁles of the AlGaN
layer. In this regard, a workﬂow for optimizing the sensitivity and linearity of the dosimeter through different
graded proﬁles is also presented. Amongst all, gaussian graded proﬁles have been identiﬁed as the best –
case scenario considering the sensitivity and exhibiting a linear operation."

axis MEMS accelerometer with pillar-shaped electrodes. In 
order to investigate the relationship between the axial 
sensitivities and the Brownian noise (BN), we examine 
accelerometer analytical models in terms of sensitivity. Based on 
the analytical model, we design and fabricate a 3-axis Au proof-

measured sensitivities are consistent with the design values. The 
experimentally obtained BN is found to be 130 nG/√Hz. These 
results confirm that the 100 nG/√Hz –level single proof-mass 3-

shaped electrode."
188,Energy Harvesting from Non-Stational Environmental Vibrations using a Voltage-Boost Rectifier Circuit,"Abstract 
We report an energy harvesting technique that generates electrical power from non-stational environmental 
vibrations. To utilize weak vibrations that are wasted by conventional rectifiers, we employ a voltage-boost 
rectifier (VBR) circuit. The VBR can convert small AC voltage from vibrational energy harvesters (VEHs) to 
a DC output voltage for driving a latter circuity, as reported in PowerMEMS 2018. A VBR chip is implemented 
by the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and experimentally evaluated with an 
electret-based MEMS VEH. The measurement results reveal that the proposed technique can generate effective 
DC voltage from weak non-stational vibrations. 
 
Motivation 
One of the main challenges for practical use of VEHs is to generate electrical power from non-stational 
environmental vibrations. Currently, most VEHs are used at resonant conditions to produce high output power 
from input vibration; output voltages from VEHs become small under non-stational vibrations whose intensity 
and frequency change randomly. To utilize such a small output voltage from VEHs, power management circuits 
have to lower the threshold voltage of the rectification and deliver a sufficient driving voltage (VDD) for a 
subsequent circuitry. Schottky barrier diodes are useful to achieve low threshold voltage rectification, whereas 
they are usually optional which costs more in the standard CMOS processes. Furthermore, conventional diode 
rectifications with the combination of DC-DC converters need off-chip inductors that increase the total 
package size. Thus, we propose an energy harvesting technique that is realized by the standard CMOS 
processes without using off-chip components [1]. 
 
Proposed method and results 
Figure 1 shows the proposed method using a CMOS-based low-threshold VBR circuit. Figure 2 describes a 
schematic of the VBR that adopts a Dickson-type charge pump topology [2, 3]. The circuit was designed to be 
suitable for the frequency range of environmental vibrations (< 1 kHz). In this work, we employed an electret-
based MEMS VEH [4] for the demonstration of the proposed method. The VBR was developed with the 0.7-
m CMOS technology and integrated in a monolithic chip with a size of 0.9 mm ×"

freedom in the electrode layout, the pillar-shaped electrode could 
also be useful to increase the X/Y-axis capacitance sensitivities in 
3-axis MEMS accelerometers with a single proof mass. In this 
work, we present the design, fabrication and experimental results 
of the pillar-shaped electrode applied to a 3-axis gold-proof-mass 
MEMS capacitive accelerometer. A proof-of-concept device is 
developed by a MEMS foundry process. The measured

189,A Climatological Study on the Two Types of Bow Echoes Over South China,"Abstract  Classical bow echoes (CBEs) normally develop due to rear-inflow jets, while merger-formation 
bow echoes (MFBEs) evolve from the merger between linear systems and preline convection. MFBEs are 
rarely documented before, and the key processes remain unclear because of the small-scale and fast-evolving 
merging processes. Using radar observations during 2015–2019, this study examines the characteristics of 
these two types of bow echoes over South China. Eighteen MFBEs and 11 CBEs are identified, accounting 
for 62% and 38% of the total 29 bow echoes, respectively. MFBEs commonly occur over coastal regions in the 
afternoon, where southerly sea breezes provide favorable thermodynamic conditions. About half CBEs develop 
over mountainous areas in the morning, and northerly winds enhance the local baroclinity and kinematic 
convergence. A new Merger-Classical index is proposed to distinguish the environments for the development 
of two types of bow echoes, disclosing the more favorable near-surface thermal conditions for MFBEs. In 
addition, more severe weather occurs in metropolitan area near the Pearl River Delta region during MFBEs, 
in which the accumulated precipitation is about 2.5 times higher than that during CBEs. This study reveals the 
discrepancies between MFBEs and CBEs over South China, emphasizing the MFBEs account for more than 
half of the total bow echoes and cause more high-impact weather in the metropolitan area. This study proposes 
a new perspective on the environment in which bow echo forms by merger process over South China, urging for 
more research to explore the underlying processes.
Plain Language Summary  Bow echoes produce damaging surface winds and heavy rainfall. 
Previous studies normally explained bow echoes using the classical theory that emphasized the importance 
of rear-inflow jet, and such echoes are termed as the classical bow echoes (CBEs) in this study. Additionally, 
the warm moist environmental conditions over South China facilitate bow echo formation through merger 
process between linear systems and convective cells. Bow echoes formed in this manner are termed as the 
merger-formation bow echoes (MFBEs). Due to the small-scale and fast-evolving process of merging, MFBEs 
are rarely documented in previous literature. This study is the first to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions 
of MFBEs and CBEs over South China using 5-year radar observations, pointing out the MFBEs account for 
more than half of the total bow echoes and cause more high-impact weather in metropolitan area than CBEs. 
In addition, we propose a new Merger-Classical index to distinguish the environments for MFBEs and CBEs. 
The differences between MFBEs and CBEs are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This paper 
emphasizes a new perspective on the environment in which bow echo forms by merger process, underscoring 
the need for more in-depth research in the future.

189,An Observational Study of Short‐Cycle Lightning Outbreaks in the Inner Core of Typhoon Hato (2017) Before Landfall,"Abstract  This study analyzes microphysical signatures relevant to the short-cycle lightning activity in the 
inner core of Typhoon Hato (2017) before landfall in China. Observations reveal that the lightning bursts were 
accompanied by enhanced inner-core convection with a behavior cycle of about 3 hr. The coupling between 
wavenumber-2 vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) and shear-forced convective asymmetries resulted in a local 
updraft enhancement. Furthermore, supercooled liquid water droplets invigorated a striking enhancement of 
graupel via riming immediately above the freezing level, further enhancing charge separation and lightning 
generation outside the eyewall. Furthermore, when similar phase-locking was associated with other propagating 
VRWs, graupel and updraft volumes were significantly boosted, leading to short-cycle lightning outbreaks in 
the inner core.
Plain Language Summary  Lightning behavior is one of the well-defined indicators of convection 
within the Tropical cyclone (TC) circulation. Before the landfall of Typhoon Hato (2017), we found short-cycle 
lightning outbreaks in the inner core of this typhoon. The interaction between the internal structures of the 
storm and changes in wind speed and direction with height could strikingly reinforce convection, thereby 
favorable for the short-cycle electrification enhancement. This scenario is distinct from diurnal lightning 
bursts within TCs, which were found in previous studies. The diurnal lightning activity is thermodynamically 
governed by radiation, while vortex-environment interactions in the inner core of Hato dynamically force the 
short-cycle lightning outbreaks revealed here. Therefore, the findings presented in this case study suggest 
that interactions between the internal structures of a TC and the environment warrant an adequate focus in the 
short-range forecasting of inner-core convection in landfalling TCs.

The microphysical characteristics, including the ice types and growth mechanisms, 
in two snowstorms over East China in 2016 (E16) and 2018 (E18) were explored using 
joint observations of a polarimetric radar and a disdrometer. In both events, the 
dendritic-growth-layer (DGL) signature (enhancements in differential reflectivity ZDR 
and specific differential phase KDP) was observed, indicative of the existence of 
horizontally-oriented dendrites and plate-like crystals. The KDP in the DGL, related to 
the total mass of ice particles, was used for snowfall nowcasting. According to the 
lagged correlation analysis, the reflectivity factor (ZH) near the ground, a proxy for 
snowfall intensity, could be well predicted by the KDP in the DGL with a 40-minute 
lead time and a correlation coefficient over 0.7 in E16. In contrast, E18 had a worse 
nowcasting performance, with the maximum correlation coefficient being ~0.53, which 
could be attributed to its more complex ice microphysical structures and processes. The 
snow in E16 mainly grew from the deposition in the DGL (mainly dendrites and plates) 
and aggregation below. In comparison, the snowstorm was deeper in E18, and the less 
oblate crystals (with larger aspect ratios) from above the DGL could grow and mix with 
the dendrites and plates in the DGL, weakening the correlation between the KDP and ice 
mass. Below the DGL, snow growth in E18 was contributed by aggregation and more 
active riming according to both radar and disdrometer observations, which further 
lowered the nowcasting performance of snowfall by the KDP in the DGL. 
 
Plain Language Summary 
Using cooperative radar and disdrometer observations, we found similarities and 
differences in the precipitation structures of two representative snowstorms on 21 
January 2016 and 4 January 2018 in East China. Near the −15°C isotherm, oblate 
crystals like dendrites and plates grew in both storms, known as the dendritic growth 
layer (DGL). The radar measurements in the DGL were a good predictor for near-
surface snowfall in the snowstorm in 2016, with a lead time of 40 minutes. The particle 
sizes grew during falling below the DGL, through the clumping together of snow 
crystals in the process called aggregation. In contrast, in the 2018 case, the correlation

between the radar measurements in the DGL and the near-surface snowfall rates was 
lower than that in the 2016 case, which can be explained by the higher complexity of 
its precipitation structure. First, the ice crystals above the DGL can grow and mix with 
those within the DGL in this case. Meanwhile, in addition to aggregation, the ice 
particles can grow via collision with supercooled droplets (riming), which led to snow 
mass growth. These findings from the two snowstorms may be used as a sort of 
guidance for improving the snowstorm numerical modeling and nowcasting.

189,Study on the Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of X-Band Dual-Polarization Phased Array Radar from Specific Differential Phase,"Abstract: In this study, the quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) capability of three X-band
dual-polarization phased array radars (PAR) in Guangzhou, South China, was demonstrated, with an
S-band operational dual-polarization radar as the benchmark. Rainfall rate (R) estimators based on
the speciﬁc differential phase (KDP) for summer precipitation for both X-band and S-band radars were
derived from the raindrop size distributions (DSDs) observed by a 2-dimensional video disdrometer
(2DVD) in South China. Rainfall estimates from the radars were evaluated with gauge observations
in three events, including pre-summer rainfall, typhoon precipitation, and local severe convective
precipitation. Observational results showed that radar echoes from the X-band PARs suffered much
more severely from attenuation than those from the S-band radar. Compared to S-band observations,
the X-band echoes can disappear when the signal-to-noise ratio drops to a certain level due to severe
attenuation, resulting in different estimated rainfall areas for X- and S-band radars. The attenuation
corrected by KDP had good consistency with S-band observations, but the accuracy of attenuation
correction was affected by DSD uncertainty and may vary in different types of precipitation. The
QPE results demonstrated that the R(KDP) estimator produced better rainfall accumulations from the
X-band PAR observations compared to the S-band observations. For both the X-band and S-band
radars, the estimates of hourly accumulated rainfall became more accurate in heavier rainfall, due
to the decreases of both the DSD uncertainty and the impact of measurement errors. In the heavy
precipitation area, the estimation accuracy of the X-band radar was high, and the overestimation of
the S-band radar was obvious. Through the analysis of the ZH-ZDR distribution in the three weather
events, it was found that the X-band PAR with the capability of high spatiotemporal observations can
capture minute-level changes in the microphysical characteristics, which help improve the estimation
accuracy of ground rainfall."

the latest observations from the dual-frequency radar and microwave imager onboard the Global

189,JNSCLCASE21566_proof.pdf,"ABSTRACT: Microphysical structures and processes in a case of precipitating stratiform clouds in North China on
21 May 2018 are investigated using joint observations from an aircraft and an X-band polarimetric radar. The results show
that there are enhancements in differential reﬂectivity (ZDR) and speciﬁc differential phase (KDP) above the 7-km altitude,
consistent with the existence of dendrites and platelike ice crystals. The horizontal reﬂectivity factor (ZH) increases and
ZDR decreases downward above the melting layer (ML), due to the prevalent aggregation process, which is conﬁrmed by
the downward increasing volume-weighted mean diameter (Dm) and decreasing total number concentration (Nt) observed
by the aircraft. Within the ML, the concentration of median-sized particles (2–5 mm) decreases rapidly downward due to
the melting process. Within approximately the top 2/3 of the ML, the melting particles’ mean and maximum sizes increase,
demonstrating the dominance of the aggregation process. This causes the enhancements of ZH and ZDR within the radar
bright band together with the increase in the dielectric constant. Within the bottom 1/3 of the ML, the breakup process is
responsible for the decreasing Dm and increasing Nt observed by the aircraft. Below the ML, the measurements by the
polarimetric radar and the aircraft only show slight variance with altitude, indicating the near balance between microphysi-
cal processes favored by the nearly saturated air. The results of the microphysics in the stratiform case would help improve
the microphysical parameterization of numerical modeling in the future."
189,Microphysical Characteristics of Extreme-Rainfall Convection over the,"ABSTRACT
During the pre-summer rainy season, heavy rainfall occurs frequently in South China. Based on polarimetric radar
observations, the microphysical characteristics and processes of convective features associated with extreme rainfall rates
(ERCFs) are examined. In the regions with high ERCF occurrence frequency, sub-regional differences are found in the
lightning flash rate (LFR) distributions. In the region with higher LFRs, the ERCFs have larger volumes of high reflectivity
factor  above  the  freezing  level,  corresponding  to  more  active  riming  processes.  In  addition,  these  ERCFs  are  more
organized and display larger spatial coverage, which may be related to the stronger low-level wind shear and higher terrain
in the region. In the region with lower LFRs, the ERCFs have lower echo tops and lower-echo centroids. However, no clear
differences of the most unstable convective available potential energy (MUCAPE) exist in the ERCFs in the regions with
different LFR characteristics. Regardless of the LFRs, raindrop collisional coalescence is the main process for the growth of
raindrops in the ERCFs. In the ERCFs within the region with lower LFRs, the main mechanism for the rapid increase of
liquid water content with decreasing altitude below 4 km is through the warm-rain processes converting cloud drops to
raindrops. However, in those with higher LFRs, the liquid water content generally decreases with decreasing altitude.

189,SCES-2022-0029_XML 1..18,"Abstract
In this study, significant rainfall microphysical variability is revealed for the extremely heavy rainfall event over
Henan Province in July 2021 (the “21·7” Henan EHR event) using a dense network of disdrometers and two polarimetric radars.
The broad distributions of specific drop size distribution (DSD) parameters are identified in heavy rainfall from the disdrometer
observations, indicating obvious microphysical variability on the surface. A K-means clustering algorithm is adopted to ob-
jectively classify the disdrometer datasets into separate groups, and distinct DSD characteristics are found among these heavy
rainfall groups. Combined with the supporting microphysical structures obtained through radar observations, comprehensive
microphysical features of the DSD groups are derived. An extreme rainfall group is dominantly formed in the deep convection
over the plain regions, where the high number of concentrations and large mean sizes of surface raindrops are underpinned by
both active ice-phase processes and efficient warm-rain collision-coalescence processes in the vertical direction. Convection
located near orographic regions is characterized by restricted ice-phase processes and high coalescence efficiency of liquid
hydrometeors, causing the dominant DSD group to comprise negligible large raindrops. Multiple DSD groups can coexist within
certain precipitation episodes at the disdrometer stations, indicating the potential microphysical variability during the passage of
convective system on the plain regions."
189,Assimilation of Polarimetric Radar Observation With GSI Cloud Analysis for the Prediction of a Squall Line,"Abstract  Dual-polarization radars can provide rich three-dimensional (3D) information on cloud 
precipitation structure. To utilize the existing polarimetric radar network in operational data assimilation 
systems, a new polarimetric radar-based cloud analysis method is introduced. New features include the 
employment of fuzzy-logic hydrometeor classification, improved estimation of liquid and ice regions, and 
newly-added number concentration estimation. The new scheme is evaluated with a typical squall line case. 
Results show that the 3D cloud precipitation structure and short-term precipitation forecast is consistently 
improved. With extra information from the polarimetric observations, the new scheme is able to produce 
reasonable polarimetric signatures for analysis. More supercooled water results in more latent heat release 
which enhances the updraft, leading to stronger convection in the subsequent forecast. This study emphasizes 
the importance of correct initial liquid and ice particle condition for the prediction of deep convection.
Plain Language Summary  Severe convective storms have always been one of the most the 
disastrous types of weather. However, due to their relatively small scale and rapid evolution, such storms are 
difficult to predict. Polarimetric radar networks have been established for nearly a decade and have been widely 
used in the monitoring and short-term forecast of severe weather. Yet, this extra polarimetric information 
has not been used in the operational data assimilation system, which is key to a successful forecast. A new 
dual-polarization (dual-pol) radar-based cloud analysis aiming to improve short-term forecasts is therefore 
proposed. Results show that the new scheme is able to capture the 3D in-cloud signature of deep convection. 
Consistent improvements are found for the prediction of 3D structure of deep convection and as well as for the 
quantitative precipitation forecast.

189,Microphysical Characteristics of the Phase‐Locking VRW‐Induced Asymmetric Convection in the Outer Eyewall of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019),"Abstract  Microphysical signatures relevant to the asymmetric convection in the outer eyewall of Super 
Typhoon Lekima (2019) before its landfall in China were analyzed from ground-based radar observations. The 
results indicate that the microphysical characteristics varied in quadrants. In the upshear-left outer eyewall, the 
convection was deepened on the inner edge due to the phase locking between vortex Rossby waves (VRWs), 
and warm rain was the predominant process contributing to the enhancement of rainfall. In contrast, the 
strongest precipitation occurred on the outer edge of the upshear-right outer eyewall. In this region, exuberant 
riming processes and graupel formation prevailed above the melting layer due to the strongest and more 
outward tilted updrafts induced by the phase locking between the VRWs. A good deal of graupel melted into 
raindrops, along with significant accretion processes, produced intense rainfall with larger drop sizes.
Plain Language Summary  Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone precipitation requires a deep-
depth understanding of the complex microphysical processes within the storm. Using ground-based radar 
observations, we found significant variation in the number, shape, and size of raindrops in the outer eyewall of 
Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) before its landfall in China. Warm rain processes governed the intensification 
of rain below the melting layer in both upshear-left and upshear-right outer eyewalls. However, in the upshear-
right quadrant, interactions of vortex Rossby waves significantly enhanced updrafts on the outer edge of the 
outer eyewall, boosting riming processes and graupel formation above the melting layer and generating the 
heaviest rainfall. These current findings may be used to weigh up and improve numerical tropical cyclone 
forecasting models.

189,Evaluation and Modification of Microphysics Schemes on the Cold Pool Evolution for a Simulated Bow Echo in Southeast China,"Abstract  A merger-formation bow echo (MFBE) in southeast China during the pre-summer rainy season 
(PSRS) was simulated using three microphysics schemes including Thompson (THOM), Morrison (MORR), 
and Weather Research and Forecasting Double-Moment 6-Class (WDM6) schemes to compare against 
polarimetric observations and Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS) analyses. The three 
schemes captured the basic kinematic structures for this MFBE event after assimilating radar radial velocities, 
but all underpredicted the cold pool strength by ∼25%. Particularly, THOM produced the best raindrop size 
distributions (DSDs) and precipitation pattern compared with observed retrievals; further analyses indicated 
the larger raindrop size bias and the weak cold pool strength in THOM were owing to the relatively low rain 
breakup efficiency and inefficient rain evaporation, respectively. By decreasing the cutoff diameter of rain 
breakup parameterization from the default"
189,Evaluating Simulated Raindrop Size Distributions and Ice Microphysical Processes With Polarimetric Radar Observations in a Meiyu Front Event Over Eastern China,"Abstract  To better understand the characteristics of simulated raindrop size distributions (DSDs) 
and ice microphysical processes for convective systems in the East Asia monsoon region, a typical Meiyu 
event is simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using three two-moment 
bulk microphysics schemes in this study. The simulated microphysical characteristics are then evaluated 
using polarimetric radar observations and retrievals. Although the observed linear storm structures are 
well simulated in terms of their location, there are significant deviations regarding simulated polarimetric 
radar variables and DSD parameters when compared to the observations. Compared to radar retrievals, 
all the simulated low-level raindrops are found to have lower number concentration and larger mean 
sizes. To investigate the sources of the simulated DSD biases, vertical distributions of radar reflectivity 
and specific ice hydrometers (snow, graupel), as well as profiles of liquid/ice water contents from radar 
retrievals and simulations are further compared. In addition, variations about the occurrence frequency 
and transfer rate for four categories of ice processes (deposition, aggregation, riming, and melting) among 
the three schemes are analyzed. Results indicate that the overprediction of snow and graupel from riming 
processes is likely to be responsible for the production of extremely large raindrops at low levels.

189,Improving Nowcasting of Convective Development by Incorporating Polarimetric Radar Variables Into a Deep‐Learning Model,"Abstract  Nowcasting of convective storms is urgently needed yet rather challenging. Current 
nowcasting methods are mostly based on radar echo extrapolation, which suffer from the insufficiency 
of input information and ineffectiveness of model architecture. A novel deep-learning (DL) model, 
FURENet, is designed for extracting information from multiple input variables to make predictions. 
Polarimetric radar variables, KDP and ZDR, which provide extra microphysics and dynamic structure 
information of storms, are fed into the model to improve nowcasting. Two representative cases 
indicate that KDP and ZDR can help the DL model better forecast convective organization and initiation. 
Quantitative statistical evaluation shows using FURENet, KDP, and ZDR synergistically improve nowcasting 
skills (CSI score) by 13.2% and 17.4% for the lead time of 30 and 60 min, respectively. Further evaluation 
shows the microphysical information provided by the polarimetric variables can enhance the DL model in 
understanding the evolution of convective storms and making more trustable nowcasts.
Plain Language Summary  Severe convective precipitation is a major cause of many 
hazards. However, very short-term forecasting, i.e., nowcasting, of convective precipitation is rather 
challenging. Current nowcasting methods suffer from insufficiency of physics information of input data 
and ineffectiveness of model architecture. As an advanced observing tool, polarimetric weather radar 
can provide crucial microphysics and dynamic structure information of convective precipitation systems. 
To incorporate polarimetric radar variables into the nowcasting task, this study proposes a novel model 
architecture termed FURENet based on deep learning. FURENet uses U-Net as a flexible backbone, and 
is specially designed to facilitate exploiting information from multiple input variables. By training the 
model with polarimetric radar variables (KDP and ZDR) as input, significant improvement of forecasting 
the initiation, development and evolution of convective storms is achieved. The results also show the 
effectiveness of model architecture.

189,Assimilation of X‐Band Phased‐Array Radar Data With EnKF for the Analysis and Warning Forecast of a Tornadic Storm,"Abstract  The impact of assimilating China's operational X-band Phased-Array radar's (X-PAR) data 
on the analysis and warning forecast of the vortex structure and intensity of the June 8, 2018 Foshan, 
Guangdong province, tornadic storm was investigated for the first time using an Ensemble Kalman Filter 
(EnKF) data assimilation system. Both radar radial velocity (Vr) and reflectivity (Z) from two S-band 
operational radars and one X-PAR were assimilated. Deterministic forecasts were launched every 6 min 
from 05:42 UTC (20 min before the tornado touched down) to 06:00 UTC from the EnKF mean analysis 
field. Five experiments were conducted to examine the added capability of Z assimilation of the EnKF 
system, and to investigate the impact of assimilating X-PAR data on the analysis and prediction of the 
tornadic storm. Compared to the experiment without Z assimilation, the assimilation of Z reduced the 
analysis error and greatly reduced the forecast error of Z. The assimilation of X-PAR data greatly improved 
the vortex structure of the tornadic storm at low levels, and improved the intensity of the rear inflow of 
the tornadic storm, especially with a higher assimilation frequency. Compared to the experiments without 
X-PAR data assimilation, assimilating X-PAR data improved the predictability of tornadic storm.
Plain Language Summary  Tornadoes are difficult to predict worldwide. However, the scan 
speed of current operational S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar is too slow to capture the evolution of 
tornadoes. The newly built X-band (3 cm wavelength) Phase-Array radar (X-PAR) network in Guangdong 
Province, China, are hopeful to fill in the gap with their higher scan frequency and higher spatial 
resolution, which can capture the fine-scale structure and rapid evolution of small scale systems such 
as tornadic storms. This study focuses on a case where a tornado embedded within the typhoon Ewiniar 
was well captured by the X-PAR network. It demonstrated for the first time the use of X-PAR data on the 
prediction of a tornadic storm in China. We used ensemble-based data assimilation techniques named 
Ensemble Kalman Filter to utilize the information provided by the X-PAR data. With the improved 
information, the analyzed tornadic storm vortex structure at low levels was greatly improved, especially 
with a higher assimilation frequency. Compared to the experiments without X-PAR data, the experiment 
using X-PAR data successfully predicted the tornadic vortex a few minutes in advance.

189,Microphysics of Stratiform and Convective Precipitation During Meiyu Season in Eastern China,"Abstract  The microphysical structure of Meiyu precipitation in Eastern China is investigated 
using two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) and S-band polarimetric radar observations. The 
constrained-gamma raindrop size distribution (DSD) model derived from 2DVD observations performs 
well in representing Meiyu DSDs. The vertical variability of polarimetric variables and retrieved DSD 
parameters are then investigated. The results show different patterns of vertical behavior for convective 
and stratiform rain due to different ice-phase and precipitation microphysical processes. The radar 
reflectivity of stratiform rain presents a distinct bright band (with an average echo top between 6 and 
7 km). In contrast, the convective rain shows a larger reflectivity with a relatively higher echo top at 8 km. 
Polarimetric signatures of convective rain above the 0°C isotherm imply the coexistence of rimed particles 
and aggregates, which is indispensable for the intense precipitation on the ground. However, with a 
bulk precipitation formed below the melting layer, warm rain processes are still critical pathways for the 
growth of raindrops and the subsequent generation of heavy rainfall. Furthermore, both convective and 
stratiform rain is dominated by raindrops <4 mm, and the increase in their rain intensity can mostly be 
attributed to the increase in raindrop concentration. The identified maritime nature of convective rain has 
a much higher (roughly more than two times) number concentration of raindrops than that of convection 
in a similar climate region. This study provides a more comprehensive picture of Meiyu precipitation 
microphysics in Eastern China.

189,jhmD190265 1605..1620,"ABSTRACT
The attenuation-based rainfall estimator is less sensitive to the variability of raindrop size distributions
(DSDs) than conventional radar rainfall estimators. For the attenuation-based quantitative precipitation
estimation (QPE), the key is to accurately estimate the horizontal speciﬁc attenuation AH, which requires a
good estimate of the ray-averaged ratio between AH and speciﬁc differential phase KDP, also known as the
coefﬁcient a. In this study, a variational approach is proposed to optimize the coefﬁcient a for better estimates
of AH and rainfall. The performance of the variational approach is illustrated using observations from an
S-band operational weather radar with rigorous quality control in south China, by comparing against the
a optimization approach using a slope of differential reﬂectivity ZDR dependence on horizontal reﬂectivity
factor ZH. Similar to the ZDR-slope approach, the variational approach can obtain the optimized a consistent
with the DSD properties of precipitation on a sweep-to-sweep basis. The attenuation-based hourly rainfall
estimates using the sweep-averaged a values from these two approaches show comparable accuracy when
veriﬁed against the gauge measurements. One advantage of the variational approach is its feasibility to op-
timize a for each radar ray, which mitigates the impact of the azimuthal DSD variabilities on rainfall esti-
mation. It is found that, based on the optimized a for radar rays, the hourly rainfall amounts derived from the
variational approach are consistent with gauge measurements, showing lower bias ("
189,VDRAS and Polarimetric Radar Investigation of a Bow Echo Formation After a Squall Line Merged With a Preline Convective Cell,"Abstract This paper is the ﬁrst to document the development of a type of bow echo, termed
merger‐formation bow echo (MFBE), in southeast China evolving from a subtropical squall line (SL)
merging with a preline convective cell (CC). Although this MFBE did not produce damaging surface winds,
its intense rain rate resulted in local ﬂooding. The evolution of the kinematic, thermodynamic, and
microphysical structures is investigated using the variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS)
analysis and polarimetric radar observations. Key factors of this MFBE event including the rear‐inﬂow jet
(RIJ) and cold pool exhibited different characteristics from those in classical bow echoes and limited
MFBE cases.
As the SL propagated towards the coast, a CC was triggered along a sea breeze front. The SL did possess a RIJ,
but a bow‐shaped reﬂectivity did not appear until the SL‐CC merger. The RIJ weakened and became
elevated during the merger, while the leading edge of SL cold pool accompanied by a weak diverging outﬂow
did not advance with the reﬂectivity ﬁeld. The updraft was strengthened due to the merger, resulting in
enhanced precipitation falling ahead of the original SL. The subcloud evaporation locally cooled the air
ahead of the SL and merged with the original SL cold pool. This combined cold pool advanced forward
rapidly and caught up with the bowing radar reﬂectivity to form this MFBE. This study illustrates the
processes of a SL‐CC merger leading to the formation of a different type of MFBE that did not produce
damaging surface winds."
189,Validation of Precipitation Measurements From the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar Onboard the GPM Core Observatory Using a Polarimetric Radar in South China,"Abstract—The
dual-frequency
precipitation
radar
(DPR)
onboard the global precipitation measurement (GPM) satellite
provides valuable measurements of precipitation. In this study,
the GPM DPR products (version 6) are validated against a
ground-based S-band polarimetric radar in South China based
on a volume-matching method. Good consistency is found for
the reﬂectivity factor (Z) calibration of the two instruments.
From the perspective of microphysics, the mass-weighted mean
diameter (Dm) estimates correspond well with those of the
ground-based radar in the inner swath of the normal scan
(NS); however, underestimation is found for the raindrop number
concentration, indicated by the generalized intercept parameter
(Nw), especially for the intense echoes. Thus, the GPM DPR
product may fail to depict the microphysical characteristics
of small-to-medium raindrops in high concentration for heavy
rainfall in South China. This is attributed to the negative Z
bias of the DPR caused probably by insufﬁcient correction of
attenuation, which also leads to clear underestimation in the
liquid water content (W) and the rainfall rate (R) products for
intense echoes. In the outer swath where only single-frequency
retrieval is available, overestimation in Dm exists regardless of
echo intensity level, and more underestimation can be found in
Nw, W, and R especially for intense echoes. In the selected
typhoon and squall line cases, better capability in revealing
microphysical properties is also found for the inner swath of
the NS. After adjusting the scan mode, the performance of the

189,Improving Time-Efficiency of Variational Specific Differential Phase Estimation,"Abstract—This study presents a variational approach for
optimized estimation of speciﬁc differential phase (KDP) for
polarimetric radars using a linear forward operator. A cubic
B-spline interpolating ﬁlter is included to mitigate the impact of
measurement error in the total differential phase and ensure the
spatial continuity of KDP. For rain, non-negative constraints are
introduced to ensure that the KDP estimates are within the phys-
ical bounds. The variational approach is ﬂexible to incorporate
the background information constructed from the measurements
of horizontal reﬂectivity factor (ZH) and differential reﬂectivity
(ZDR) based on the self-consistent relationship of polarimetric
variables. The variational approach is evaluated using simulated
experiments, as well as real observations from an S-band oper-
ational weather radar. Without including background informa-
tion, the variational approach has slightly better performance
compared to the approach based on linear programming (LP),
and the background information helps to further improve the
performance. In addition, the linear forward operator makes this
variational approach computationally efﬁcient. It needs less than
3% computational power required by the approach based on LP,
making it more suitable for real-time operational applications.

190,A Modified Heffron-Phillip's Model for The Design of Power System Stabilizers,"Abstract—In this paper a modiﬁed Heffron-Phillip’s (K-
constant) model is derived for the design of power system
stabilizers. A knowledge of external system parameters, such
as equivalent inﬁnite bus voltage and external impedances or
their equivalent estimated values is required for designing a
conventional power system stabilizer. In the proposed method,
information available at the secondary bus of the step-up trans-
former is used to set up a modiﬁed Heffron-Phillip’s (ModHP)
model. The PSS design based on this model utilizes signals
available within the generating station. The efﬁcacy of the pro-
posed design technique and the performance of the stabilizer has
been evaluated over a range of operating and system conditions.
The simulation results have shown that the performance of the
proposed stabilizer is comparable to that could be obtained by
conventional design but without the need for the estimation and
computation of external system parameters. The proposed design
is thus well suited for practical applications to power system
stabilization, including possibly the multi-machine applications
where accurate system information is not readily available."
190,New approach for the design of pole placement power system stabilizers,"Abstract—Pole placement power system stabilizers (PSS) are
well known for their superior performance when compared to
the conventional lead-lag stabilizers. They require feedback of all
the state variables which are generally not measurable. In multi
machine systems pole placement designs require feedback of
other machine states as well. This paper proposes a new approach
for the pole placement based PSS. In this paper, recently proposed
modiﬁed Heffron Phillip’s model is used for the PSS design. It
is derived by taking the secondary bus voltage of the step-up
transformer as reference instead of inﬁnite bus. State variables
of this model are locally measurable, which makes the pole
placement design decentralized. The performance of the proposed
controller is evaluated on a single machine inﬁnite bus system
over a wide range of operating conditions. The proposed PSS
performance is found to be better than the conventional PSS."

190,Power System Stability enhancement by Single Network Adaptive Critic Stabilizers,"Abstract-This paper proposes a Single Network Adaptive
Critic (SNAC) based Power System Stabilizer (PSS) for enhancing
the small-signal stability of power systems over a wide range

network instead of the action-critic dual network architecture
of typical adaptive critic designs. SNAC eliminates the iterative
training loops between the
action and critic networks and
greatly simplifies the training procedure. The performance of
the proposed PSS has been tested on a Single Machine Infinite
Bus test system for various system and loading conditions.
The proposed stabilizer, which is relatively easier to synthesize,
consistently outperformed stabilizers based on conventional lead-
lag and linear quadratic regulator designs."
190,A Nonlinear Voltage Regulator With One Tunable Parameter for Multimachine Power Systems,"Abstract—This paper proposes a nonlinear voltage regulator
with one tunable parameter for multimachine power systems.
Based on output feedback linearization, this regulator can achieve
simultaneous voltage regulation and small-signal performance
objectives. Conventionally output feedback linearization has been
used for voltage regulator design by taking inﬁnite bus voltage
as reference. Unfortunately, this controller has poor small-signal
performance and cannot be applied to multimachine systems
without the estimation of the equivalent external reactance seen
from the generator. This paper proposes a voltage regulator
design by redeﬁning the rotor angle at each generator with respect
to the secondary voltage of the step-up transformer as reference
instead of a common synchronously rotating reference frame.
Using synchronizing and damping torques analysis, we show that
the proposed voltage regulator achieves simultaneous voltage
regulation and damping performance over a range of system and
operating conditions by controlling the relative angle between the
generator internal voltage angle
and the secondary voltage of
the step up transformer. The performance of the proposed voltage
regulator is evaluated on a single machine inﬁnite bus system and
two widely used multimachine test systems."

190,Synchronizing and Damping Torques Analysis of Nonlinear Voltage Regulators,"Abstract—This paper makes an attempt to assess the ben-
eﬁts of replacing a conventional generator excitation system
(AVR + PSS) with a nonlinear voltage regulator using the
concepts of synchronizing and damping torque components in a
single machine inﬁnite bus (SMIB) system. In recent years, there
has been considerable interest in designing nonlinear excitation
controllers, which are expected to give better dynamic perfor-
mance over a wider range of system and operating conditions. The
performance of these controllers is often justiﬁed by simulation
studies on few test cases which may not adequately represent
the diverse operating conditions of a typical power system. The
performance of two such nonlinear controllers which are designed
based on feedback linearization and include automatic voltage
regulation with good dynamic performance have been analyzed
using an SMIB model. Linearizing the nonlinear control laws
along with the SMIB system equations, a Heffron Phillip’s type of
a model has been derived. Concepts of synchronizing and damping
torque components have been used to show that such controllers
can impair the small signal stability under certain operating
conditions. This paper shows the possibility of negative damping
contribution due to nonlinear voltage regulators and gives a new
insight on understanding the physical impact of complex nonlinear
control laws on power system dynamics."
190,Power System Stabilizers Design for Interconnected Power Systems,"Abstract—This paper proposes a method of designing ﬁxed
parameter decentralized power system stabilizers (PSS) for in-
terconnected multi-machine power systems. Conventional design
technique using a single machine inﬁnite bus approximation
involves the frequency response estimation called the GEP(s)
between the AVR input and the resultant electrical torque. This
requires the knowledge of equivalent external reactance and inﬁ-
nite bus voltage or their estimated values at each machine. Other
design techniques using P-Vr characteristics or residues are based
on complete system information. In the proposed method, infor-
mation available at the high voltage bus of the step-up transformer
is used to set up a modiﬁed Heffron-Phillip’s model. With this
model it is possible to decide the structure of the PSS compensator
and tune its parameters at each machine in the multi-machine
environment, using only those signals that are available at the
generating station. The efﬁcacy of the proposed design technique
has been evaluated on three of the most widely used test systems.
The simulation results have shown that the performance of the
proposed stabilizer is comparable to that which could be obtained
by conventional design but without the need for the estimation
and computation of external system parameters."
